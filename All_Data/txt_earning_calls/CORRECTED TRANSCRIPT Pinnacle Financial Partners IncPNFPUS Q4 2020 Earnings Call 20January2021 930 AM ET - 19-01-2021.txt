All right. Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us this morning. I know everyone's familiar with the fact that
we're coming to you from Nashville, Tennessee, home of Vanderbilt University. There's an accounting professor
at Vanderbilt that, in years past, has used Pinnacle as a case for his accounting class. And the students have to
decipher our financials, our footnotes, follow all our SEC filings, listen to our earnings calls, and so forth. And so in
the class immediately following the assignment to listen to our earnings call, he told me that he opened it with just
an open-end question to sort of get their overarching reaction to the call, and he said that they had two
overarching reactions. He said, one, those guys sure sound optimistic; and two, they sure sound southern. And
so, my guess is that following our call today, you may have the same reaction.
Fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter for us. We had key success measures like asset quality, core deposit
growth, fee income growth, pre-provision net revenue growth, and tangible book value accretion, all very strong
during the quarter. We began every quarterly call with this dashboard, reflecting our key performance metrics on a
3

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
GAAP basis. But honestly, there's so many adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that we're truly
managing here at Pinnacle that I want to move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted non-GAAP measures.
As you can see here on the top row, total revenues, fully diluted EPS, and adjusted PPNR are all up meaningfully
on a quarterly basis. 2020 revenues are up roughly 9% year-over-year at a time when many have been predicting
banks cannot earn in 2021 what they earned in 2019. We are very proud that our second half 2020 fully diluted
EPS exceeded 2019's by 28%. Adjusted PPNR for 2020 is up nearly 9.4% over 2019, while PPNR per share is up
11.4%.
Along the second row, you can see that loans are up 13.3% year-end 2020 compared to last year. Harold will
review in greater detail shortly and talk about our expectations going forward. But generally, we continue to
believe we'll produce loan growth, primarily based on our ability to take market share. Due to our prolific hiring,
we've hired 175 revenue producers over the last two years. And that's more than 20% of our total revenue
producers. That represents enormous market share movement potential, which I expect differentiates our growth
opportunity from many, if not most of our peers.
Core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace during the quarter and for the entire year. And in spite of
the COVID challenges, we continue to have a track record for consistently growing tangible book value per share,
with nearly 15% growth in tangible book value per share in 2020.
Across the bottom row, you can see that asset quality held up really well in the fourth quarter with NPAs of just 38
basis points, classified assets actually down this quarter to the lowest level in the last five years, and annualized
net charge-offs of just 19 basis points in the quarter.
I'm going to turn it over to Harold and Tim to review the results in much greater detail. As we go through the
details, I find that there's a lot to be encouraged about regarding our net interest margin fundamentals, particularly
the trajectory of our cost to deposits.
Fee income was solid this quarter. Mortgage had a great year. BHG's report card during this pandemic continues
to outperform expectations. Our revenue per share for 2020 was $15.05. That's up nearly 11.4% from this time
last year and significantly better than the median peer comparisons.
We talked about our transition to defense earlier in 2020, allocating a meaningful part of our human capital to
reviewing our loan book, borrower-by-borrower. Tim's going to update you on the work that he and his team
accomplished in Q4 as well as give you insight on what we're seeing and learning from our clients. At least for
me, our asset quality performance inspired optimism, though, as we all know, there are still unknowns relative to
vaccine rollout and the full reopening of the economy.
So, Harold, let me turn it over to you.

Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. Many of our slides we've shown for quite some time, and fourth quarter
results were basically consistent with what we've anticipated from last time. So, I don't believe there's a ton of new
information, so I'll hit the highlights.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
We did experience some wealth of loan growth for the fourth quarter. Excluding PPP, we were up almost 8%
annualized between third quarter and fourth quarter. We don't have a trend just yet, but it was a positive signal.
We will lean on our new hires over the last few years to give us an advantage on loan growth.
As you know, we're in great markets. We don't apologize for any market where we do business. So, we think that,
too, will help us outperform when entrepreneurs begin to see the fog lift and we see loan growth reemerge in a
more predictable way. That said, our market leaders believe that loan growth forecasts, excluding PPP of high
single-digit growth in 2021, is a reasonable number for our firm.
As to loan yields, ex-PPP, loan yields were pretty flat. Keeping loan yields will be a fight in 2021. We will lean into
our relationships even harder to maintain our yields. Granted the steepening curve should be helpful to us, but
there's a lot of liquidity out there. So, finding borrowers is more difficult, plus you've got a lot of banks out there
using pricing as leverage because I don't know a bank that doesn't have a considerable amount of own balance
sheet liquidity.
The PPP program is back in the news and we're excited about deploying the next round of funding, and hopeful
we can place a meaningful amount during the first half of 2021. Although, we don't expect to have similar level of
PPP volumes in the second round as the first, we do believe we're ready to be just as successful in the second
round as the first, and also believe this will be incredibly beneficial to those small businesses in our market that
continue to be impacted by the pandemic.
Over the last few weeks, for those clients that we – that are interested in the second round, we preloaded data
files to expedite the process. So, we've surveyed these clients and are contacting them currently to explain the
new program and gauge their interest. As of close of business yesterday, we've received approximately 4,000
applications totaling almost $600 million. So, we're off to a pretty rapid start.
As to the first round forgiveness process, it remains rigorous, but our team is working through with our clients. We
expect net interest income lift – we expected net interest income lift in the fourth quarter through the PPP
forgiveness and expect more lift in the first half of 2021.
Now, onto deposits, we had another big deposit quarter. We've experienced significant growth in non-interest-
bearing deposits ending at $7.4 billion at quarter end, up 54% since last year. The number of commercial
checking accounts is up almost 12% since year-end. Our average loans to average deposits was at its lowest
level than I can ever remember at 83%. We expect to reverse that trend at some point in 2021.
We were at 33 basis points on average deposits at the year-end and at 29 basis points for EOP rates. We are
intentional about getting those numbers down to less than 25 basis points very quickly.
We're getting a few questions about deploying excess liquidity. We're beginning to get interested in various ways
to leverage some of this cash flow given the steepening of the yield curve, but we'll be very cautious in whatever
new opportunities we see to deploy excess cash.
So, we will have an opportunity to reduce our wholesale funding book over the next several quarters, which we
fully anticipate doing. This reduction should help reduce funding costs across the board and help our NIM. Similar
to what some other banks announced during the quarter, although our opportunity wasn't nearly as large as
others, we did redeem $200 million of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings prior to maturity and incurred a $10.3
million prepayment penalty. We also unwound a cash flow hedge set to start in January 2021 that we've been
5

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
carrying for a few years. Combined loss of around $15 million between the two, but should be paid back within
two years.
We have other opportunities with Federal Home Loan borrowings that we will evaluate prospectively, but the
payback period is too long currently for us to get excited about those right now.
As for the cash flow hedge, due to liquidity swell, we no longer have the need to carry the wholesale funding that
was hedged by the swap. Therefore, we recognize the previous unrealized loss once we cancel the funding. By
paying off the Federal Home Loan Bank advance early and unwinding the cash flow hedge, we should stay close
to $7 million in interest expense in 2021.
Our liquidity build cost us approximately $2 million a quarter. We will shed this excess liquidity at some point likely
more slower than we'd like. We believe that both PPP and our excess liquidity negatively impact our fourth quarter
NIM by 30 basis points, which is down from 40 basis points in the third quarter.
We believe our NIM after PPP and liquidity is approximately 3.27%. This compares to a similar calculation last
quarter of 3.22%. So, we're up 5 basis points from the previous quarter. Thus, our adjusted NIM is up two
quarters in a row. We call that a trend. Seriously, this will be a big focus of our bank going into 2021.
Now to fee income. I'll be brief. Fees were more than $83 million for the quarter. For the year, fee revenues grew
40% in 2020, which we believe was remarkable. Everyone knows that 2020 was a power year for mortgage. We
don't expect to repeat in 2021. But then again, mortgage doesn't get a pass either. I'll talk more about BHG in a
few minutes, but BHG continues to issue great report cards every quarter.
Wealth management had a big year as their fees were up 17.5% year-over-year. We expect they will have a great
year in 2021 as they have made several key hires in the latter part of 2020 across our markets.
As to expenses, as we've stated in the press release, 4Q 2020 expenses were higher than anticipated due to a
discretionary bonus award approved by our board last week. As we've stated in the past, our annual cash
incentive is tied directly to results. Due to COVID, we failed to hit our EPS targets this year due primarily to the
required increased provision as a result of CECL adoption.
During the year, and as I mentioned last quarter, we modified our cash incentive plan to incorporate a PPNR
component. All in, our plan would have calculated a 50% target opportunity based on the modified structure of the
plan. Our PPNR results will help us ramp into 2021 with a lot of momentum.
The board elected to increment their award for participating associates modestly to 65% of target given the impact
of COVID to our 2020 results. Just so you know, missing our target payout on incentives resulted in $25 million in
savings to our results, coupled with a similar issue for equity incentive compensation that was another $6 million
in savings in 2020. That approximate $0.31 per share that found its way to our bottom line and into tangible
capital in 2020. Speaking for the employees of our firm, we're hopeful those savings aren't repeated in 2021.
All of us obviously are pleased with the board's decision and what the additional 15% means to some 2,200 client
participants. That said, we missed this year and the focus for 2021 will be to overachieve. So, our 2021 plan
design will still target top quartile performance within our peer group and still incorporate both EPS and PPNR
targets.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
The leadership of our firm is determined to not let a trend develop on less than target payout to our associates.
That's a trend we will work hard to avoid, and to do it, we will look forward to meeting and exceeding our financial
objectives in 2021.
Quickly, some comments on capital. Our board has approved authorization of $125 million buyback program. The
previous program expired at year-end 2020. We will begin to consider deployment of those funds soon, but are
not likely to see any material impact from the authorization in the first quarter of 2021.
We also have a couple of sub debt issuance that are up for renewal this year. So, we will consider redemption
and/or refinance in due course. The board increased the quarterly dividend yesterday, so given all of our
associates – our shareholders, we were grateful for that as well.
We are a firm that works on many things. We are focused on growing earnings per share and PPNR in an
outsized way. And we are also intentional about growing tangible book value per share. We've accomplished a lot
of things this year [ph] than 2016 (00:15:25). One thing we are particularly proud of is that, since that time, we've
increased our tangible book value per share by 85%. We will continue our focus on tangible book value per share
growth.
I'm not going through this slide in depth as we have covered most of this previously. Obviously, we appear more
optimistic than most. That said, we have a great confidence in our people, our markets, and our clients, and
renewed optimism around reopening of our local economies.
Now to BHG. This is a familiar slide to most and provides a snapshot of BHG's business flows over time, and
more importantly how they're holding up during the pandemic. The blue bars on the chart are originations that
have ramped up with more loans being funded with records being set nearly every quarter for the past three
years. Business flows are strong and their model is hitting on all cylinders.
The green bars represent loans in which gain on sale has been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream
banks. This is the traditional BHG model with gain on sale revenues being generated. As you can see, the green
bars are fairly flat, not necessarily because of the appetite for their loans has decreased, but because of the
building of balance sheet loans and diversifying their business model with interest income.
Coupons have fluctuated over the last three years, ending down at 13.8% for the fourth quarter. As to bank buy
rate, they also fell to 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The good news is that net spreads remain in the mid-9s, which
over time has been up from previous years. The bottom-right chart details now over 1,200 banks in BHG's
network and almost 700 individual banks acquired BHG's loans in 2020.
This has to be one of the strongest funding platforms for our gain-on-sale model in the country. There are firms
out there trying to replicate this, but they've got to get real busy real fast to find a funding platform like BHG. Like I
said last time, it's taken 20 years, but it belongs to BHG. They own it, they developed it, and they capitalize on it.
The top left chart, we've shown on several occasions. The quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily in
the past and over the last few years, but particularly in 2020. They continue to refine their scorecards and
increase the quality of their borrowing base. Again, the right chart and as I've said before, maybe the most
powerful chart I have to offer related to BHG's steadily improving credit quality.
Looking at losses by vintage, losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination, thus pointing toward
a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans. Pandemic-related events will likely cause these
7


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
losses to move upward, but the quality of the borrowing base, in our opinion, is very impressive and is much
higher than the borrowers from just a few years ago.
We've updated BHG charge-offs and reserve build chart. These are for loans that BHG has sold to their network
of community banks. The green bar shows that currently they have more than $3.6 billion in credit with banks who
have acquired BHG loans. The orange line details the annual loss rate, while the blue line on the chart details the
recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks.
2020 losses landed at 4.26% basically consistent with the last few years and during a year where who knew how
COVID would impact loss rates. The recourse obligation reserve is used to reserve for future losses for the loans
sold to other banks. With COVID, they increased the reserve in the first quarter and incremented it slightly.
One note that may be of important interest to some, included in the 4.26% is also prepayment losses related to
early payoffs. So, good borrowers that pay off early, BHG reimburses the bank for unpaid premium. Just so you
know, that makes up about 30% of the 2020 year-to-date loss rates. We don't anticipate any significant lift in
recourse reserves in 2021.
Lastly, we said it last quarter and we'll say it again, it's been a big year for BHG and we anticipate big things in
2021. During the third quarter of 2020, the credit markets improved, which allowed BHG [ph] operating (00:19:57)
to execute on their first $160 million securitization. Appreciate that that securitization went out with investment
grade rating. This allows BHG to continue to diversify its revenue stream, not so much away from gain on sale,
but with incrementally more interest income as well as provide another competitively-priced funding source to its
business model. We're expecting another similar securitization at BHG in early 2021.
The chart on the top right is a little new. It shows the trends related to the more important line items on BHG's
balance sheet. As noted at year-end 2020, BHG held over $200 million in cash and slightly over $1 billion in
loans, funded by almost $650 million in borrowings. The red bar I found both interesting and comforting. BHG has
over $500 million in reserves and capital. It's a healthy franchise. It's a sound franchise.
So, wrapping up, loan growth at Pinnacle in 2021 will take work, but we are optimistic. Loan pricing in the fourth
quarter held, deposit growth has been remarkable, deposit pricing is headed down. BHG had another great year
and credit for both Pinnacle and BHG is very much manageable.
To say I'm pleased with how this quarter and year ended up is again an understatement. It's difficult to relate a
significant effort that my colleagues are putting forth every day working with clients and solving their problems
through this weird time. We all know it's a difficult operating environment. Loan demand is sluggish at best and
who knows where the yield curve is headed.
However, the bright spots for Pinnacle are [ph] met (00:21:36). Depositors continue to trust us and borrowers
seem to have figured out how to manage their businesses through this cycle. Our operating leverage also
remains top quartile. We do have the best clients and discipline remains very important. Additionally and
hopefully, COVID-19 finds its way to our rear view mirror.
Last quarter, we had hoped for an effective vaccine. This quarter, we have a vaccine, in fact, we have many
vaccines. Hope has transitioned to tangible optimism. Our recruiting platform is scoring all over the franchise. We
do like our franchise and where we do business and with whom we do business.

Migration patterns continue to favor Tennessee, the Carolinas and Georgia. We like our competitive prospects.
We remain a force in Tennessee, as well as in several markets in the Carolinas. We're winning in Charlotte,
Raleigh, Charleston, and as I've said before, we think we can score big in Atlanta.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to talk about growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Harold. Using the traditional credit metrics of net charge-offs, NPAs, classified assets and past due
loans, Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to hold up very well. We acknowledged that for some of our clients, the
first half of 2021 may prove challenging, but we remain optimistic given the combination of the new stimulus
package, additional PPP loans for our clients and the COVID vaccines.
As in the prior two quarters, our bankers and credit teams completed thorough client credit reviews by collecting
monthly financial statements and/or rent rolls to re-evaluate our borrowers' assigned risk grade. Particularly
emphasis was placed on a non-pass credit and on the loans that we had rated a low pass risk grade due to
COVID.
The results for our fourth quarter work were encouraging. Our classified assets decreased $46 million. For
criticized loan category, we had a modest net increase of $100 million. This minor increase was in part attributing
to three hotel construction loans that construction had just been completed during the fourth quarter. We moved
these hotel loans into a criticized rating to be consistent with our conservative hospitality grading methodology
applied in prior quarters. The balance was made up of small loans and an assortment of property types or
industries.
Similar to the second and third quarters, during the last two weeks of December, we conducted a four-question
survey of 258 C&I clients with loan balances totaling $653 million. The survey was targeted at our low-pass grade
clients in a wide variety of segments such as entertainment, restaurants, and consumer services. Three of the
questions were asking to borrowers' estimates of revenue for fourth quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter
2019, first quarter revenue of 2021 to first quarter 2020, full year revenue for 2021 compared to full year 2020,
and the last question was regarding months of liquidity on hand to cover operating expenses.
The responses remained guardedly optimistic. 60% said fourth quarter 2020 revenue would be between 75% to
100% of fourth quarter 2019. 72% estimated first quarter 2021 revenue would be between 75% to 100% of first
quarter 2020. 90% estimated full year revenue for 2021 to be between 75% to 100% for year-end 2020. And 53%
reported seven months of liquidity or greater.
During the first and second quarters of 2020 when COVID's economic impact was largely unknown, Pinnacle
proactively reached out to clients to offer loan payment deferrals. Our payment deferrals range from 90 to 180
days and were administered with minimal credit qualification. Given the obvious challenges at that time, we did
not attempt to re-underwrite and assign new borrower risk grade. We approached the deferrals as a short-term
solution or a band aid to help clients in a period of uncertainty with very little incremental risk to us in our view.
Pinnacle's philosophy regarding 4013 loan modifications is much different. Our modifications were negotiated
from the framework as a longer-term solution to help our client bridge to the other side of COVID. Our philosophy
was to improve the bank's position and to simultaneously help our client.

Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
With each modification, we collected very current borrower financial information in our efforts to accurately re-risk
rate the borrower and to contemplate the terms of our modification. A key distinction between our deferrals in
4013 modification is that the vast majority of our clients with the 4013 modification are paying interest monthly.
As illustrated in the table, our hotel loans make up 63% of our total 4013 modifications. 52% of our hotel loans
have a 4013 modification. While each individual hotel loan modification was negotiated to fit the borrowers'
specific circumstances, our modifications generally consisted of changing the loan repayment terms to interest-
only for 3 to 12 months, in consideration for borrower concessions such as: pay the accrued interest that
accumulated during the earlier deferral period, establish an interest reserve on deposit with Pinnacle and shorten
the loan maturity.
As illustrated in our supplemental deck, our hotel book is held up. Our hotel portfolio occupancy for November
was 48.7% compared to STR's national occupancy average of 40.3%. We attribute this to our history of
conservative hospitality underwriting and our book's composition of limited service, economy and extended-stay
hotels.
This slide is to provide detail around the segments of our loan portfolio that we deemed COVID-high impacts. As
this slide exemplifies, even within these segments, the performance is held up. We believe a few of the
contributing factors for this performance include client selection; we hire experienced bankers, they bring their
best clients with them; Pinnacle's very successful PPP program for our clients; and finally excellent early problem
loan detection, coupled with a very experienced special assets team.
Pinnacle's credit metrics have held up well. We will continue our client-by-client defensive work throughout 2021.
As Harold indicated, we will be working with our clients in the next few weeks to again, deliver an outsized PPP
loan program to provide them the added security.
And now, I'll hand it back to Terry to talk about moving forward in this pandemic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tim. As part of our first quarter 2020 earnings call last April, I told you that my expectation was in
the final analysis, 2020 wouldn't be about 2020's earnings but more about how well we could position our firm to
return to our previous earnings trajectory following the pandemic. Harold and Tim have done a great job of
highlighting the various moves to shore up liquidity and asset quality and loss-taking capacity in the form of
incremental capital and loan loss reserves.
Our board was equally nimble to provide incentive for us to focus on building PPNR, which, as you can see, is
exactly what we did in the last half of 2020. And in addition to that, even in this pandemic, we hired 90 revenue
producers in 2020, more than any other year in our history, which I believe has served us well as we're beginning
to transition back to a more offensive footing and position this firm to capitalize on what some believe will be a
extraordinary market share-taking opportunity following the pandemic.
As I mentioned in my introductory comments, in my view, fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter, with NPAs at
38 basis points, classified asset down to 8.1% and past due to 19 basis points, asset quality appears excellent.
Adjusted EPS was up 24% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted PPNR was up 27% over the same quarter
last year and revenues were up 20% over the same quarter last year.

We believe that BHG has validated the power of their differentiated model as they've continued to originate and
sell record volumes of loans through their proprietary auction platform and have also successfully securitized
loans in what was the first commercial or consumer loan transaction to be rated AA by Kroll on its inaugural
issuance, another testament to the quality and value of the assets they generate. All of this during a period some
predicted might be disastrous.
And as we've already pointed out, even with the dramatic EPS and PPNR growth in 2020, we still figured out how
to afford to hire 90 revenue producers in 2020. And so, as was our goal, we find ourselves well-positioned to
move back to offense as the pandemic subsides and economy reopens. Happily, my guidance as we move into
first quarter 2021 is that you should expect us to continue focusing on the same items we've been focused on
over the last several quarters.
Operator, I'll stop there and we'll be glad to take questions.

I don't – I think Stephen may have hopped off. This is Jennifer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Jennifer, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Good morning, guys. So, two questions for you. Number one, Terry, you said you want to be more
aggressive now again with hiring, but you also have a premium currency again. I'm wondering what your interest
is in M&A now versus your interest in more hiring in 2021 and 2022. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. So, just as a reminder, my view today, as my view has always been, is that we are
primarily an organic grower. And our principal mechanism or core capability to get that done is our ability to attract
and hire great bankers in the markets. And as you know, we're in some really attractive markets with relatively low
share positions. And so, I think you ought to expect that we're going to continue to push on our organic growth
model, our hiring, which we believe will be good. And so, that'll be the principal thrust of our company.
Jennifer, it's a great question, there's no doubt, I guess, over time, I've been asked the last few years about M&A
and so forth. And my own view was that our stock was unfairly traded and I believe that it traded at a premium as
people start investing in buying stocks based on book value causes my stocks compress more than others. That's
my view. Others may have a different one. But anyway, the net of all of that is it did cause me to say, well, I
wouldn't be interested in trying to deploy my stock as a currency when it is so significantly disadvantaged.
I don't think I would characterize M&A as my principal thrust as I see it. My principal thrust will be to grow
organically. But I think it does open up additional possibilities that can be considered and looked at and evaluated
and so forth, trying to make sure we're making whatever the next best smart play is. But again, I guess, I don't
want that to get overweighted in my commentary there. The principal mechanism we intend to deploy is organic
growth primarily through hiring people.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Second question, if I could, what changes in your strategy do you envision post-pandemic, whether it be
less need for corporate real estate or branches, or how you meet with clients and prospects and do business or
travel, can you just talk about how you think that could change the Pinnacle strategy over the long run?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'm confident there'll be changes. But honestly, Jennifer, for us, I believe that they'll be modest. So, just to
recap why I believe that, as you know, we're principally a commercial bank. So, our branching strategy has been
built around that. Of course, BNC had a little different model, a little heavier in terms of branch distribution in some
13


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
of their markets but in the great growth markets that we desire to win in like Charlotte, like Raleigh, and then, of
course, Atlanta where we've [ph] de novo-ed (00:37:37), I mean, we're at a distribution disadvantage.
So, we're not like a lot of companies that have this legacy branch distribution network that needs to get shared or
trimmed back or whatever, we're likely on the other end of that. Just to sort of put that in context for you, Jennifer,
I think since we did the BNC deal we announced that in 2017, I think we've closed about 20 offices in our
footprint. They're obviously concentrated in the BNC footprint. So, we think we've sort of right-sized or optimized
the distribution that we have.
Again, I just want to make sure you get the picture. Our position is that we're investing in Charlotte, we're
investing in Raleigh, we're investing in Charleston, South Carolina, and we're investing in Atlanta, and so, we
could use more distribution in those markets.
Again, I think you talked about on travel and some of those variables, again, our strategy is a geographic strategy.
So, we're generally calling in local markets. There's no doubt that today feedback is a lot of clients [indiscernible]
(00:38:42), you call them on the phone and come see them, but that's not a meaningful dip in our travel budget.
And my expectation is that, from a strategic standpoint, the investment that we're trying to make in technology, I
would say, is focused on two things, the things that we consider are generally focused on trying to keep us as a
fast follower in terms of commercial capabilities. We're focused on the pain points of our clients, not just – we're
not trying to have the [indiscernible] (00:39:12), we're just trying to focus on what is it in real terms that clients
need.
And then I guess the additional aspect of that is we're trying to put our FAs, our financial advisors, our client-
facing people in a position to be more effective and more productive. And all that means is we're trying to gather
more information, get it to them in a way that they can use that in advising clients and so forth. So, that's really
where the [indiscernible] (00:39:41) will be over the next several years. So, I don't look for major changes in our
strategy. I think it's pretty simple and pretty much [indiscernible] (00:39:53).

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes we can. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Good. Sorry about that. So, I'm curious, I know you touched on this for Jennifer's question, but just the
pace of new hires in particular, I mean net-net, you ended up being pretty flat for both of the last two years, but it
looks like about 34 new revenue producers here in fourth quarter. So, I mean, do you think, on a relative basis,
2021 could be significantly more active than the last two years on a hiring basis standpoint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it will be more active. I think the variable, Stephen, as you know, if the vaccine is much slower coming out,
those kinds of things, that could slow the process because the sales – the length of the sale cycle, whether you're
recruiting people or moving business is lengthened in a COVID environment. So, that would weigh to the negative
side.
But I think on the positive side, our reputation is really strong in the markets that we're trying to grow in and the
vulnerability is really high at many of the large bank competitors with whom we compete, lots of turnover going on
in several of those organizations. And to your point, the hiring was actually really strong in the fourth quarter. And
my expectation is that if it's one way or another, it ought to be stronger in 2021 than in 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And I'm curious on the loan growth side of things. I know Harold said kind of overall demand still looks
sluggish. Obviously, you guys have benefited more from the new hires and your continual kind of hiring plan that
occurred over time. But I'm wondering especially in fourth quarter what kind of changed to the upside. It seems
like growth was maybe better than even you all would have anticipated, say, on this – at this time last quarter on
the call. And so, just kind of curious what transpired in the quarter that came out better than you would have
expected and what you see apart from the new hire growth as you look into 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Stephen, this is Harold. I wish I could put my finger directly on it. But I think in large part, I believe there
were some construction projects that began to fund up. I think also we saw some year-end C&I borrowings
coming in all lines of credit. And I'm hopeful, I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I'm hopeful there's some
optimism with some borrowers. So, maybe that will continue in the first quarter. We think first quarter loan growth
is going to be fairly sluggish. But I'm hopeful that people begin to see like some renewed optimism and willing to
take some risks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it, got it. That makes sense. And then maybe just last thing for me following up maybe a little bit on Jenny's
M&A question would be just where would the size of a potential deal need to be at this point in your life cycle to
really make sense for you guys to pursue it or move the needle? I mean, it's a lot different from when you would
15


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
have done M&A three, four years ago. So, I'm just curious what your views are in terms of maybe asset size or
where someone need to be for it to be relevant?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'd just say that we focus on it more from the EPS accretion standpoint than we do anything else but you
can sort of back into assets size that would yield that sort of earnings accretion. But generally we're looking for
something that's going to produce double-digit earnings accretion. It'd be hard for us to get interested in doing
something that didn't do that. And so, that said, I mean, you probably got to get on out there to $5 billion bank or
north to begin to produce – have the chance to producing that sort of earnings accretion.

Maybe to start, for Harold, regarding the high-single-digit guidance for expenses for 2021, is that off the base of

Harold R. Carpenter A

Okay. That's helpful. And then on BHG, so we're seeing the bank industry, right, start to release reserves more so
this quarter. Do you see it likely that BHG starts to release reserves here over the near term and maybe that in
the high-single-digit guidance that you're giving in terms of earnings growth [ph] for now (00:45:08)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I'll say it this way. Based on what I've seen regarding their plans for next year, I don't – there's no planned
reserve release. So – but obviously, they will be monitoring that and if it looks like there should be some, they will
probably consider that in next year's results. But we're not thinking that in our single-digit number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Got you. But if we look at where their net charge-offs came out for the year, relative to where the reserve is
now, it would appear they're fairly dramatically over reserved. Would you agree with that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I would agree with that. I think they've built a very healthy balance sheet. Like I said, we're comforted by that
balance sheet. And I would not be surprised to see some reserve release next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then finally, so if I look at the fee income outlook, obviously, you guys, like everybody else,
will have this mortgage fee headwind to work through. And I think you're calling for strong fee income growth in
2021. Could you help us think about – I'm not sure what you mean by strong, can you help with that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'll try to talk around it some. Mortgage, we're not anticipating a repeat by any stretch. Most of the other
business units, we are anticipating or expecting might be a better word, strong fee growth out of the other
mortgage – out of the non-mortgage units. That said, it's probably going to be somewhere around mid-single digit
kind of numbers we're looking at currently. Hopefully, we can get to that.

Hi, Brett.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett D. Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
I wanted to first just go back to talking about core deposits. You're looking for, I think, slower deposit growth going
forward but you obviously had really strong core deposit growth in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk
about the – and I think you had 12% growth in deposit account, so obviously really strong. Can you just talk about
the pace of – you're slowing from here, what's driving the growth in fourth quarter versus the anticipation of a
slower growth profile going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think there are several things going on in there, Brett. I think number one, let me back up here and try to put it in
a broader perspective. Going back over the last couple of years, we have said about – and I've used this term
internally as we talk with our associates that we're about changing the personality of our firm. I think reputationally
we'd be viewed to be great asset generators. We've probably not been viewed to be as strong in terms of core
deposit generators, some of that's tied into the commercial growth of the franchise, those kinds of things.
But irrespective, we have said about change personality of the firm and say, okay, so what does that mean? What
that means is we – in 2020, we altered our incentive plans. We've always focused on earnings primarily,
secondarily on revenue growth. In 2020, we switched to provide instead of the revenue to focus on deposit growth
both volume and cost. And that was an important thing to help us beat the drum, change the mindset, and so
forth. I think that has [ph] many implications (00:48:52) as to what people worked on their diligence and gathering
deposits and so forth.
I think beyond that, we also launched a number of different initiatives, some which have some pretty long lead
times. But we had built a great platform for HSAs as an example, which we believe is a phenomenal market
opportunity for us. We've also built capability to bank property managers, homeowners associations, those sorts
of organizations with sort of value added accounting support, that's beginning to pay dividends, paid dividends in
2020 for us. We've focused on qualified settlement funds and various other products.
We've got a product that is focused on captive insurance for middle-market businesses, that's opportunities
middle market businesses have. And so, we're finding strong growth there. So, I don't mean to go on and just give
you a feel, but I want to put in perspective, there's a lot of things going on that are structural in change in the
personality of our firm to be a better deposit gathering. There's some product capabilities that are beginning to
pay dividends and I expect to pay dividends going forward.
Now, where we are, as you know, there's tons of liquidity on our balance sheet that has to do with nothing but
PPP. And in other words a bunch of money got put on our clients' balance sheet as a result of that. And then in
18


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
addition to that, a lot of those business clients in this kind of environment build their own liquidity, so whatever
means of mechanisms they have beyond PPP. And so, all that stuff going on, some of it is a function of what's
going on right now tied into COVID and some of it's a function of the structural changes that we're trying to make.
So, I've rambled through all that to get down to this.
We ought to see a diminishment in this liquidity build. Our case is we think this economy would begin to reopen in
the latter half of this year. So, you ought to have some diminishment in liquidity that's associated with PPP and
other corporate liquidity that weighs on, slows the growth, it should diminish. But we do also have these initiatives
that we think are going to continue to pay dividends. So, again, I'm just trying to give you the puts and takes there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett D. Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Yeah. That's great color, Terry. And then, the other thing I was curious about was just the buyback. Do you
anticipate being active with the buyback this year or is that more of a reup and your stock's obviously a lot higher
than it was and if your growth is going to be there, then maybe you don't get to use it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, well, right now, the planning assumption is that we'll use probably 80% of it this year or into the first
quarter of next year. We'll obviously use it to defend the stock when we need to. And, the impact to earnings is
not nearly as significant as it would have been otherwise given where the share price is. But I think we'll spend a
significant portion of that money at some point during the year.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just looking at the second round of PPP, you guys are so successful with it in the first round. Can you give us
some help, I guess, just thinking about the potential size of the second round? And then, as you are going out and
working with your customers on that, are you – how successful are you, I guess, targeting those – maybe those
unrated commercial customers that you're more concerned about earlier on and getting them a second round?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Let me just update you based on this morning. We're at about almost $600 million in application flow on the
second round now. More than 90% of that were borrowers that were involved in the first round of PPP last year.
So, if you remember last year, we did 14,000, 15,000 loans and $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion in balances. We don't
anticipate nearly that kind of level. We're somewhere thinking based on the surveys we did over the last couple of
weeks with the prior borrowers that we're probably going to be somewhere around maybe almost $1 billion if we
can get to that number. So, that's kind of where we're thinking we're going to end up at with respect to the second
program.
Is that what you were looking for, Jared?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. That's great. And then when you look at where that $1 billion is going and you overlay that with your – the
credits you're still more concerned about, how much penetration do you think you're going to get with those
COVID-sensitive industries or those borrowers that still are struggling a little bit more?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think a lot of those will go to hotels, retail, restaurants, and entertainment for sure. But I think this time,
there will be fewer big dollar kind of loans. I think it'll be largely to smaller businesses that are trying to get through
these next few months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. And then, looking at those 90 hires you did in the year, are you seeing or do you
anticipate a longer period of time for them to sort of breakeven or be able to ramp up and get their customers in
based on COVID, and when should we think that that really starts contributing to the bottom line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's a great question. I think generally what our – just from 30,000 feet, Jared, what our plan assumption has
always been on the revenue producers that we're hiring, generally, we're hiring people that have big books of
business and so forth. And so, depending upon whether you're talking about a middle-market banker, a private
banker, a broker, a mortgage originator and so forth, there are some different dynamics in terms of how people
get their books moved. But generally, we expect them to consolidate the vast majority of their book over a three to
four-year period of time, call it, four years. Our belief is it generally ought to work that way. We generally believe
that they're going to get through breakeven in the first 12 months.

There may be some slowness in there, but it's not a lot. In other words, it does take us – as I mentioned earlier, it
does take us a little longer to recruit somebody and get them in the boat than it did without COVID. It takes them a
little longer to get their book moved than I think it did pre-COVID. But I don't mean it like stretched and elongated
a year. I think it elongated a month or two kind of thing. So, we don't have dramatically different planning
assumptions about how quickly they'll cross breakeven or how quickly they'll consolidate their outlook.

Brock Vandervliet Q

Good morning, guys. I wonder if we could just start with BHG. I was curious about that reserve level. Have they –
did they adopt CECL or not yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, they have not adopted CECL. I think they are two years out from having to formally adopt CECL. So, they
don't have – they're not CECL-compliant yet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So, they might have more flex in managing that level. Okay. And on the bank buy rate, appreciate that
disclosure, I had thought that if there was potentially an issue with BHG, you might see the bank pull away as
soon as COVID broke and, obviously, that didn't happen.

Yeah. I think when I talk to the BHG folks, and we'll give an update here in a couple of days, the auction platform
is very competitive. They've seen numbers where bank yields are getting down into the high 3s because that
paper is so attractive to them. So, yes, it's a very solid – they've kind of restricted the flow into the auction platform
with the buildup of the balance sheet trying to get ready for this next securitization. But right now, there's a lot of
banks after that paper.

Okay. I'll follow up more on that offline. You mentioned sticking to credit, a couple of construction loans were
moved to criticized that had just been completed. How – what's the outlook for those? Are those just now
considered stabilized financing or are you waiting for a third-party takeout there?

Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Not waiting for a third-party takeout. We did have a few of our construction loans that were modified where we
provided a longer interest-only period. I would say we moved them into that risk grade category purely just to be
consistent with prior quarters. We felt like the hospitality industry was such where it was just prudent to move
them into criticized.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
But for a loan that was formerly construction, you had no – there's no issue with it remaining on balance sheet. It
just remains there at probably reasonably attractive terms.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Correct. Correct. I think there were a couple of those that we, as a modification, established an interest reserve
that they would put on to deposit with Pinnacle to kind of help them weather through COVID until travel and hotel
occupancy rates increased.

Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Most my questions have been answered, but I want to get some clarification, Harold,
on the NII guidance. Is that inclusive of PPP? I think you have like $56 million in 2020. Just trying to figure out
what the base is. And then does that include any of the round two that you're talking about? If you can just kind of
help us on the starting point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. It does include forgiveness of – I think I've got $40 million in accretion coming from the PPP
program and most of that will happen in 2021. But it does not include any kind of income from the second round.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So it is inclusive of PPP. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as I think about the average loan and deposit
growth targets that you laid out, is that also the full year average for both of those? Because if I look at the
22


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
average deposit growth, I mean, it would imply a pretty big reduction in deposits just year-on-year if I'm looking at
the full year average.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Now, normally on loan and deposit growth, we're talking about EOP growth. So, let me know if you have any more
issues around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, okay, yeah, I can follow up offline. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks.

Thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good afternoon, Catherine. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I'm good. Well, you've given a lot of PPNR guidance, which I think is helpful and I think it's clearly showing some
upside from where consensus is sitting today, so that leaves the provision, which I know is a big unknown for
everybody and hard to predict. But I want to see if you could just, as you sit here today and you're thinking about
how your borrowers are behaving and what you're seeing in your markets, what would be your best guide as to
the sense of timing of when we'll start to see losses flow in and perhaps also your expectation for when we may
start to see more – we had a little bit of reserve release this quarter but maybe more active reserve release and
when those two things may come together? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Catherine, I'll speak to reserve release and what we're kind of thinking about and then I'll let Tim talk about loss
content. Yeah. We think there's probably a high likelihood of reserve release this year and we did a little bit in the
first quarter. Our planning assumption is that we'll have some this year, not a lot, but it's also pretty – I mean, you
can probably get to a more significant reserve release pretty quickly depending on the success of the rollout and
what that does to unemployment by the end of the year.
So, I guess, what we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters has been you'd see a reserve build.
We thought reserve would be fairly flat here in the fourth quarter. It actually went down a little bit. We thought we
23


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
could see kind of a flattish reserve for the first half of 2021 and then start seeing loss content emerge towards the
end of the second quarter, end of the third quarter and then looking at a bigger reserve release at the end of the
year. But it looks like on the reserve release side that may be happening a little quicker than we had originally
thought. That makes sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
It does. And is unemployment the biggest piece that's driving that or how much of it is also being driven by your
specific credits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
As far as the ratio of allowance to loans, not the absolute level of the allowance, charge off experience, which has
been relatively benign so far as well as any kind of non-performing past dues, non-performance charge-offs, all
influence reserve. But you're right, the biggest influencer that's in basically every model – every credit model that
we're using for CECL is the biggest macro influencer would be unemployment, the forecast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then [ph] just (01:04:07) on timing of losses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Catherine, this is Tim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, Tim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I would tell you that certainly the rollout of the vaccine and the fiscal stimulus will help. I think to the extent that
we've got a very successful PPP loan program, again, that will serve as a mitigant. My intuition and anecdotal
since the losses going into 2021 will be similar, probably a little bit higher first and second quarter, not a dramatic
change but maybe a slight uptick.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Brian. How you doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good. Hey, Harold, just back to your question on the – or the last question on the reserve. I mean, just can
you kind of put a range around – as you kind of get through and get more comfortable with credit, continue to see
that happen, kind of where that post-COVID reserve to loan, I guess, if that's you're looking at the reserve to loan
ratio kind of might range to or maybe a range of where you think of that ends up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, we're not thinking anything around the terms of where it was pre-COVID. So, we were down into that 40, 50,
60-basis-point in that number. I really don't know how deep it can go. It's very difficult to forecast these credit
models into the future, like to try to peg what our number might be at the end of this year given a certain
unemployment forecast. So, there's a whole lot of guesswork going on. It just seems like the trends are with
respect to loss content, non-performance and the like that we'll see some decrease.
Sidebar and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. I think it'll be an interesting conversation over the course
of the year for not only us but all banks as we start seeing reserve releases and when the regulators show up
regarding that. So, I don't think you'll see us get us anywhere near what we had pre-COVID. But we should see
some meaningful reductions in our reserves because we had significant build over the course of last year. And we
really don't think we'll see that loss content material.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful, Harold. And just the – can you just kind of comment a little bit on the pace of
reduction in the wholesale fundings and kind of the size of the balance sheet as you go for a haircut, timing of that
and then maybe just kind of the influence on the margin and the kind of the core margin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We've got – I think that there's a slide in the deck, a chart in the deck that's talk about like $2 billion in
wholesale funding. Most of that is in broker deposits that we fully intend to redeem. I think the average yield on
those things is – already on those things is somewhere around 50 or 60 basis points. So, that will have a positive
influence on our margins or deposit pricing, so on and so forth.
In the third and fourth quarter, we don't have a whole lot of opportunities for wholesale reductions. I'll say that kind
of optimistically, by the time we get to that part of the year, perhaps, some prepayment penalties related to
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings that will come down. And so we may re-evaluate prepayments on Federal
Home Loan Bank borrowings. I've got about $1 billion of that left on my balance sheet. As I said earlier, the
25


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
prepayment penalties on that today is just a little bit rich for our appetite. So – but we may re-evaluate that
towards the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then maybe just one for Tim. Just, Tim, I guess, I know you said that criticized maybe went
up a touch this quarter. I guess would your anticipation be that we're at a peak on the criticized levels now based
on kind of the outlook for credit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I do. I think there could be a little bit more migration, but I do. A lot of our criticized, as you know, with the hotel
book, and we pore over that every quarter. And I describe that criticized level as very stable. We think it will take
some time to migrate back into past grade just given the depths of what happened in the hospitality industry. But
my own intuition or gut based on these in-depth quarterly reviews, I feel like that's about peaked.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Nice quarter.
