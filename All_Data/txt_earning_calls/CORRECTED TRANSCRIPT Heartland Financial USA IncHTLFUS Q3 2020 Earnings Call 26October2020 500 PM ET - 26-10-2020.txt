President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance and our COVID-19 response. And then
Bryan McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around Heartland's results. Now also joining us
today is Nathan Jones, EVP and Chief Credit Officer, who will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Well, during these very challenging times, our priority has been the safety of our employees and the ongoing
support of our customers, our shareholders, and our communities. We continue to differentiate ourselves through
our strong capital, liquidity, credit, and financial performance metrics. Bruce Lee and Bryan McKeag will provide
more detail on the many things that we're doing to support, protect, and care for our employees, customers,
shareholders, and communities.
So now on to the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2020, I'm very pleased to report that we had an
excellent third quarter. In fact, it was a record quarter, the best in our history, with net income available to
common shareholders of $45.5 million, compared to $30.1 million for the linked quarter. Net income before our
Series E Preferred dividend totaling $2,437,000 was nearly $48 million. Earnings per diluted common share was a
$1.23, compared to $0.82 for the linked quarter. This was our second best quarter for EPS, second only to Q2
2019 at $1.26, which included $18 million of after-tax income from the gain on sale of our mortgage servicing
portfolio at Dubuque Bank and Trust and gains from several branch sales.
Annualized return on average common equity was 16.11%, which exceeded the prior four quarters. Additionally,
annualized return on average assets at 1.19% also surpassed the prior four quarters. The net interest margin on a
fully tax equivalent basis was strong at 3.55% for the quarter and 3.74% year-to-date. Book value and tangible
book value this quarter were at $46.11 and $32.91, respectively, an increase over Q3 of 2019 of 8% and 11%,
respectively.
Well, with respect to the balance sheet, assets reached a new record high at $15.6 billion, and we achieved
substantial growth across all categories over the last four quarters. Assets were up an amazing $3 billion. Net
loans were up $1.1 billion. Investments were up $1.9 billion, and non-maturity deposits, which is our focus, up
$2.4 billion, and equity was up $248 million. With a substantial growth in our balance sheet, we still remain very
liquid, and all of our capital ratios, including our regulatory capital ratios, remained strong. Our tangible common
equity ratio improved to 8.03% at quarter-end, up from 7.89% last quarter.
Well on to M&A, as we discussed last quarter, we are on target to close the AimBank transaction in West Texas in
early December, with the conversion set for mid-February 2021. AimBank will be merged with and into
Heartland's Lubbock, Texas-based subsidiary, FirstBank & Trust, contributing over $1.8 billion in assets and will
substantially contribute to net income for 2021. With this acquisition, FirstBank & Trust will be Heartland's largest
bank with approximately $3 billion in assets. They will become the fifth largest bank headquartered in West Texas
and the third largest deposit market share bank in Lubbock.
Well, also in early December, our Arizona Bank & Trust bank in Phoenix, Arizona will complete its purchase and
assumption of the four Johnson Bank Phoenix branches. This will be a simultaneous close and conversion,
adding approximately $392 million in deposits and $184 million in loans, and will contribute nicely to net income
for 2021. This transaction will take Arizona Bank & Trust assets to nearly $1.3 billion. As I've said in the past, our
priority has been to expand our current footprint and work toward our goal of $1 billion in assets in each state
where we operate. And I'm pleased to report that 10 of our 11 banks have reached our goal of $1 billion or more
in assets this past quarter.
Well, as the industry continues to consolidate, market share and market position become more and more
important. We are top 10 deposit market share in 26 of our 38 MSAs, and top 5 deposit market share in 13 of our
3

38 MSAs. In closing last week, Heartland's board of directors approved a $0.20 per common share dividend
payable November 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 13, 2020. The board also approved a
preferred dividend of $175 payable on January 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2020.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the
company's operating performance, COVID-19 response, and credit. Bruce?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by expressing my gratitude and admiration for the
teams across Heartland and each of our member banks. They have demonstrated an uncommon commitment to
our company, customers, and communities. I'm humbled by their dedication, resiliency, and creativity as we
navigate the challenges and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Heartland's record third quarter earnings highlight our continued focus on our customers, our core business, and
our expense discipline, while operating in a low interest rate environment. In the third quarter, we delivered pre-
provision net revenue of $65.1 million, an increase of 35% from a year ago and flat from the linked quarter.
Earnings per diluted common share of $1.23 compared to $0.94 a year ago, an increase of $0.29, or 31%. Net
income available to common shareholders of $45.5 million, that's the most ever, a 32% increase from a year ago,
and a 51% increase from the linked quarter. Our lowest ever efficiency ratio of 54.67% for the quarter, 618 basis
points lower than a year ago, and 108 basis points lower than the linked quarter. Year-to-date, our efficiency ratio
is 57.3%. After third quarter last year, our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 63.3%.
I'm proud of how we're operating during a pandemic. Our banks are open for business. We're delivering the high
level of service our customers expect, and Heartland continues to invest for growth. Employee and customer
safety remains our top priority. We continue to operate under our pandemic management plan, protecting our
employees and customers while effectively running our business. Employees who can work from home do so,
while those who come into bank locations and offices run rotating teams to limit exposure. Heartland's diverse
geographic footprint continues to be a strength during the pandemic. Only two of our 113 banking centers are
closed, and we are operating in 82 communities. We're serving customers in lobbies, drive-thrus, or both, as well
as digitally. We've demonstrated our flexibility closing and reopening bank lobbies as appropriate. 25% of our
banking centers are fully open and operating as normal. 75% currently operate drive-thru only or with restricted
lobby access. We'll continue to adapt to local conditions and are comfortable and confident in our ability to
operate in this environment for the foreseeable future.
Consumer behavior has changed as a result of the pandemic. Digital transactions continue to increase, and
branch transactions have decreased approximately 32% year-to-date. Given this ongoing consumer shift to
digital, we continue to rationalize our branch footprint. In the third quarter, we approved six branch consolidations,
and an additional 10% of branches are under review.
Turning to deposits, we delivered another strong quarter of deposit growth. Total deposits ended the quarter at
$12.8 billion, and non-time deposits totaled $11.8 billion, increasing $123 million, or 1%, during the quarter. 7 of
our 11 banks delivered non-time deposit growth, led by Dubuque Bank and Trust with a 5% increase, and Rocky
Mountain Bank with a 4% increase. Our deposit mix remains enviable, with 39% in noninterest-bearing accounts
and 92% in non-time account balances. We've also been diligent in executing our deposit pricing strategy and
have reduced total deposit costs just 16 basis points for the quarter, down from 20 basis points in the second
quarter and 70 basis points from the third quarter of last year.

Turning to loans, our total commercial lending portfolio decreased slightly by 1%, or $78 million, from the linked
quarter. In our remaining portfolio, agriculture decreased $12 million from the linked quarter, residential mortgage
decreased $34 million, and consumer loans decreased $23 million. Earlier this month, the SBA began to process
PPP forgiveness applications. To date, 24% of our borrowers have submitted forgiveness applications,
representing $297 million of our $1.2 billion in PPP loans. On October 8, the SBA released a simplified
forgiveness application for PPP loans under $50,000. Approximately 40% of our client borrowers with balances
representing less than 4% of our PPP loan portfolio are eligible. Many PPP borrowers are still waiting to begin the
forgiveness process in anticipation of additional rule changes and clarification of tax implications.
Turning to key credit metrics, our nonperforming loans decreased 12 basis points from the end of the second
quarter, representing 89 basis points of total loans at the end of the third quarter. As a percentage of total assets,
nonperforming assets declined 11 basis points from 66 basis points to 55 basis points over the same period.
Other real estate also decreased to $5.1 million at the end of the third quarter from $5.5 million at the end of the
second quarter. The delinquency ratio continues to improve, decreasing to 17 basis points from 22 basis points
over the prior period.
Due to the pandemic, we anticipated a downward shift in risk ratings. This has started but not to the extent
expected. Non-pass rated loans increased from 8.1% in the second quarter to 8.7% in the third quarter. The ratio
remains at a relatively low level. Substandard loans comprised 47% of total non-pass loans, compared to 44% in
the previous quarter.
Lastly, net loan charge-offs for the third quarter were reported at $21.3 million, or 92 basis points, compared to
$2.4 million, or 11 basis points, in the second quarter. This increase was driven by two commercial credits, first, a
previously identified and reserved for charge-off of $11.6 million on a fracking sand company that operates in an
industry that's been negatively impacted by the pandemic. We do not have additional exposure to the fracking
sand industry. The second large charge-off was a newly identified $5.9 million loan in the wholesale wine industry
in California. Excluding charge-offs from these two large commercial borrowers, charge-offs would have remained
close to flat from last quarter, and we are encouraged with the overall improvement in our credit metrics during
the pandemic.
As of September 30, of the approximately $1.1 billion of loans modified under COVID relief programs, $860
million have returned to original payment terms and $133 million remain in their original deferral status and only
$122 million or 1.3% of total loans have received additional or second modifications.
69% of these second modifications are principal and interest deferments for 90 days, the remainder are primarily
interest-only payments for 90 days. More information about Heartland's loan exposure to customer segments, we
believe, are more heavily impacted by COVID-19 is available in the table on page 3 of our news release.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Heartland's financial performance will depend on the severity
and duration of the pandemic, related restrictions on business and consumer activity, and the availability of
government programs to alleviate economic stress.
Turning to strategic investments. We're investing for growth and to enrich the customer experience through our
company-wide initiative Operation Customer Compass, all while achieving an all-time low efficiency ratio. We
completed the upgrade of our ATM network installing more than 100 new ATMs across our footprint. The new
ATMs are state of the art and offer significantly more convenience and fraud protection. New features such as
image deposits will benefit our small business customers allowing them to make bulk deposits 24/7 without
visiting our banking center. We're already seeing the benefits of this upgrade. In the third quarter deposits at our
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
ATMs increased 17% from the previous quarter. We've also implemented enhanced authentication measures
across our digital channels to protect our customers from fraud.
In just last week we began offering video banking at Wisconsin Bank & Trust. This innovative video banking
platform allows consumer customers to transact business, open accounts and apply for loans with a live banker
via video. We will evaluate expanding the pilot program across our footprint based on customer feedback and
acceptance. We know more customers are preferring to bank virtually, and we're committed to transforming the
banking experience taking a customer first, innovation-oriented approach.
We reached another significant milestone in September with the final transition onto the best-in-class Salesforce
CRM and nCino Loan Origination platforms. These tools enable commercial teams at each of our banks to better
serve and meet the needs of our clients while supporting business development efforts. We're achieving our goal
of delivering efficiency, speed and an improved internal and external customer experience, evidenced by a 25%
decrease in the time from loan application to funding. We've introduced solutions to design to make banking
easier and more accessible for our commercial clients, as they modify their business operations in this current
environment.
In the third quarter, we began rolling out our improved e-deposit product, a software solution that remotely
captures and manages deposits, giving clients greater security and compatibility from almost any device. We
launched integrated payable enhancing our electronic accounts payable product suite, giving commercial clients a
single solution for all payment types. We are advancing our lock box capabilities to help business clients including
medical companies automate the process of securely collecting check payments while decreasing the potential
for error or fraud. On the M&A front, we're scheduled to close AimBank in December and complete system
integration in February 2021. AimBank combined with FirstBank & Trust will create Heartland's largest bank with
over $3 billion in assets. AimBank's third quarter performance was within our expectations.
In December, Arizona Bank & Trust is scheduled to complete its acquisition of Johnson Bank's four banking
centers in the Phoenix market. The close and simultaneous conversion is expected to raise Arizona Bank & Trust
assets to $1.3 billion.
Part of Heartland's mission is to enrich lives in our communities. On October 5, we announced the donation of
more than $260,000 to high-needs schools. This donation will provide teachers with money to purchase the
supplies and materials they need to help students learn in a safe and healthy environment. I'm grateful that
Heartland is providing this support to our schools. In addition to the $1.2 million, we contributed in April to non-
profit organizations responding to challenges created by COVID-19. These donations and our employees'
volunteer hours make a meaningful difference in the communities where we live and work.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Heartland's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our record
performance and financials. Bryan?

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing the press release which shows reported
earnings per share of $1.23 this quarter. This includes provisions for credit for losses of $1.7 million, an
acquisition and integration costs of $1.1 million. Excluding these items, Heartland's after-tax pre provision
acquisition and integration costs, earnings per share was $1.29.

I would also point you to our updated third quarter investor presentation which is in the IR site on our website.
Again this quarter, core earnings and results were solid with financial trends and metrics also positive in almost all
aspects. As I mentioned, the total provision for credit losses this quarter was $1.7 million driven by a $5.9 million
provision on a [ph] new problem (00:25:39) credit that was identified and fully charged off during the quarter, and
a $45 million increase in sub-rated loans. These were largely offset by $147 million decline in loan balances and
an $85 million decline in unfunded commitments. The updated consensus, economic forecasts showed
improvement. However, the economic outlook factors and components we use to develop the allowance will not
change reflecting Heartland's assessment that a significant level of economic uncertainty remains.
Net charge-offs this quarter totaled $21.3 million with $13.9 million attributed to loans that had already been fully
reserved in the second quarter of 2020 and then the new $5.9 million charge-off of the previously mentioned loan.
In total, the $1.7 million quarterly provision plus the $21.3 million in net charge-offs resulted in a decrease in the
total allowance for lending-related credit losses of $19.6 million. At the end of the quarter, allowance for credit
losses on loans was $103.4 million or 1.14% of total loans and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded
commitments was $14.3 million or 15 basis points of total loans. Together, these two allowances result in the total
allowance for lending-related credit losses of $117.7 million or 1.29% of total loans. When PPP loans are
excluded, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses increases 19 basis points to 1.48% of loans.
Moving on to the rest of the balance sheet. Total assets grew $600 million, ending the quarter at just over $15.6
billion with a loan to deposit ratio of 71%. The tangible common equity ratio increased 14 basis points to 8.03%
from 7.89% last quarter as increases from retained earnings and the fair value marks on bond portfolio were
partially offset by the impact of a $600 million increase in assets. Heartland's regulatory ratios also remained
strong with the common equity Tier 1 ratio at 11.29% and the total risk based capital ratio at 15.47%.
Investments grew $823 million this quarter as we invested some of our excess liquidity and pre-invested some of
the expected cash flow from the PPP forgiveness. Investments now comprise 33% of assets with a tax equivalent
yield of 2.54% with duration of just under six years and generate approximately $50 million of cash flow on a
monthly basis. Borrowings increased $436 million due to the pre-investing strategy and totaled $831 million or
5.3% of assets at quarter end.
At September 30, our banking network had approximately $4.1 billion of unused borrowing commitment capacity.
So Heartland's balance sheet continues to be very strong with solid capital base, healthy loss reserves, ample
liquidity, and low leverage.
Moving on to the income statement. Net interest income totaled $122.5 million this quarter or $1.6 million lower
than the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.55% or 30 basis points
lower than last quarter, reflecting declines in loan and investment yields of 25 basis points and 37 basis points
respectively that were slightly offset by a 7 basis point drop in the cost – interest cost on borrowings and deposits
compared to last quarter. This quarter, the net interest margin improved 10 basis points of purchase accounting
accretion compared to 16 basis points in the prior quarter. Non-interest income totaled $31.2 million for the
quarter, up $600,000 from last quarter as the gain on sales loans was up $1 million on higher mortgage loan
activity, while total security gains [ph] decreased (00:30:19) $1.2 million compared to last quarter. In addition,
service charges, loan servicing fees and trust fees were all higher this quarter.
Moving to non-interest expense. Non-interest expenses remained well-managed, totaling $90.4 million this
quarter, were flat compared to last quarter. Core run rate costs which excludes acquisition, integration and
restructuring costs also excludes tax credit costs and asset gains or losses decreased $1.7 million, $86.6 million

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
compared to $88.3 million last quarter. More specifically, salary and benefits were up slightly at approximately $51
million and occupancy, furniture and equipment costs combined totaled $9.2 million, down slightly this quarter.
These categories account for two-thirds of our core costs and they've been at this level for the past 10 quarters. In
addition, our FTEs of 1,827 also remained relatively flat this quarter and over the last 10 quarters has declined by
$389 million or 18% from a peak of 2,216 FTE in quarter two 2018.
During that same time period, assets have increased $4.3 billion or 38%. These results demonstrate the leverage
and increased productivity we have achieved as we work to restructure the company, trim our branch network,
and implement the many Customer Compass productivity improvements we've identified over the past two and a
half years all while continuing the company's significant growth. One other expense item I would mention is losses
and write-downs on the assets which totaled $1.8 million this quarter and included $1.2 million of write-down on
branches as part of Heartland's ongoing branch optimization program.
As this program continues to progress, we expect additional branch write-downs to occur over the next one or two
quarters. So going forward, excluding new acquisitions, we would expect the following trends to continue over the
next one or two quarters including muted loan growth excluding PPP and modest deposit growth. PPP
forgiveness, timing remains uncertain, but it's likely to be slower than we have been estimating with more of the
forgiveness moving into 2021. The net interest margin remained under pressure; however, declines should be
much less than we saw in the third quarter and mortgage activity will seasonally decline but will be higher than it
has been in prior years during the same period. Core expenses should remain stable at the $86 million to $87
million range.
With regard to the closing of our two upcoming M&A transactions that are both scheduled to close in early
December, on a high level and on a combined basis these transactions will add $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in loans
and $1.9 billion to $2 billion in deposits and approximately $96 million in goodwill and $17 million in deposit
intangibles and should provide an approximate 10% to 11% lift to our core EPS after cost saves are realized and
after adding almost $5.1 million of additional shares for the AimBank transaction.
And lastly, M&A and conversion-related costs of $4.5 million to $5 million should be a -- should come in the next
two quarters with $1.5 million next quarter and the remaining in Q1 of 2021. In the interest of time, I would also
direct you to my comments from last quarter for additional details on these transactions.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
A question on the net charge-offs, you detailed what $16.5 million in the two loans, the remaining call it $5 million.
Where in those in categories that also COVID at risk or that you'd peg as any more detail on the remaining bucket
even though it was just smaller balances just any detail on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. This is Bruce and I'll let Nathan also chime in. But I would say there's nothing in the remaining balances
after you get past those two large charge-offs that would I guess lead us in any direction of sort of normal activity
for our portfolio side. Nathan, any other comment there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No. Bruce, you said it well, it's supposedly across the usual suspects. You'd see it diverse across numerous
credits everything from development to [indiscernible] (00:36:21) dollars.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And the commentary about expected to remain elevated. Bruce, I think you've mentioned that absent the
two, the [ph] fracking (00:36:35) and kind of wholesale line credits you would have charge-offs similar to the prior
quarters, just trying to gauge that elevated comment. Is it – are we in the 10 basis points to 15 basis points or are
we somewhere north of that just trying to gauge -- and what is maybe driving that elevated [indiscernible]
(00:36:56) I guess heading into as modification sort of roll off here?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
Yeah. I'll jump in and then Nathan you can add. But I think you're picking the comment up from our earnings
release. And I think it just reflects the fact that there's uncertainty going forward. Knock on – knocking on wood
here, as we went through this quarter, we really took the charges that we saw there and there was I don't think
any really big ones coming down the [ph] pike (00:37:31) that we knew of at that point. But things change fast, I
mean the $5.9 million charge that we did take this quarter showed up quick and had to be dealt with. So in this
environment, I think we're always concerned that could – we could get a surprise. But I think we're in pretty good
shape.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think the other comment I might make is that while we're very pleased with the credit metrics both the
NPA numbers, the delinquency numbers are less than 2% of our loan portfolio remaining with some sort of
deferral, we are seeing elevated increases in our nonpass credits. There's a lot of uncertainty around COVID.
There are spikes happening in about half of the states that we operate in so there's been sort of a little bit of a
pullback from recent reopenings. And there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty around a government stimulus
program. So I think we're just trying to be cautious with that statement more than anything specific that's showing
up in our numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. That addressed that pretty well. Thanks. Maybe one last one, just on the loan run-off and we got –
Bryan, get your comments on expectations for muted loan growth but in terms of absolute run-off in a quarter and
what may continue to be a headwind, is that – I'm going to guess it's a combination but is that lower demand
and/or you're sort of tightening credit appetite? I'm just trying to get a sense for what is the force, maybe which is
greater your hesitation on new loans or demand is drying up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So it's a couple of things. Let's first take the residential mortgage portfolio and consumer. That really is -- as
you know, other than in Texas, we pretty much exited the residential mortgage business. We did have a portfolio
with rates remaining very, very low. Those loans are being refinanced away from us.
We generally are able to maintain the deposit relationship but the loan itself is being [ph] refi-ed (00:39:54) out as
home values have been -- have continued to be steady or increasing. So that's the story there. The consumer
book is a little bit the same way. Most of our consumer loans are home equity loans which in this low rate
environment if people have balances their – and home values continue to appreciate, their refi-ing those balances
into a longer term 15-year fixed rate, low interest rate mortgages.
So as long as rates continue to be low, we would expect to see some run-off for those reasons and those
portfolios. We're actually feeling fairly confident in our commercial book and the new activity with our renewed
focus on C&I operating companies where we're seeing a decrease there is we are seeing our construction
portfolio pay off as we anticipated. Many of the loans that we funded during the construction phase are going into
the secondary market and there is some of the investment real estate that we've had on our books is being
refinanced out not necessarily for credit reasons. We'd like to keep them but more for pricing reasons. A lot of the
community banks, smaller community banks are taking those $2 million, $3 million, $4 million investment real
estate deals, booking those in the mid $3 million. And we just don't think that's a good trade-off. And so there is

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.

Hi, Andrew.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Bryan, I appreciate your comments on the margin, but just curious kind of with this strategy you've taken on
kind of prefunding some securities with expected payoffs of PPP like where do you think the margin sort of
flattens out and how much pressure do you think remains in the coming quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, I've got to [indiscernible] (00:42:18) with a lot of ifs because the...

Bryan R. McKeag A

[indiscernible] (00:42:20) things going on. I think we probably have another 5 basis points to maybe 10 basis
points of the dropping just given the mix change that we've seen with investments being a higher percentage, that
wasn't there for the whole quarter. So there's probably a little bit of that. I mean the PPP forgiveness, we'll see
what the timing is of that. That could change things just a little bit. But how much excess liquidity then shows up
again this quarter with deposits and how much will loans grow. Certainly, loan growth would help a lot. We can
get that to even switch out the cash flow from the investments into the loan portfolio would be great. So I think
before Johnson and Aim come in, I would say you've probably got another 5 basis points or maybe 10 basis
points if things get a lot of liquidity and everything. But the size of the balance sheet is bigger so I would say,

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
Andrew, even though you might see a margin go down, I think net interest income is going to remain relatively flat
to where it was this quarter. So, I think we can hold on there.
Now, Johnson is going to come in and Aim both have excess liquidity. The good news is Aim's portfolio has a --
they've been having the net interest margin that's north of 4%, and in fact almost 4.5%. So that will help the
margin when that comes in even though we'll get some excess liquidity. So there is really a lot of moving parts.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. Right. And then on the loans that have gotten a second deferral, is there any sort of commonality among
them? And then I guess what's the tone out of there – out of those borrowers? And then eventually, if they still
need more deferrals after that, what's the process of resolving some of these relationships if they're still struggling
at the time of that deferral payment ending?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Nathan, you want to take that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. The overwhelming majority is probably is being experienced by most other banks in industry as well is
really located within the lodging portfolio, really seeing the most [indiscernible] (00:44:50) and needing the
additional support of additional deferrals. We are seeing some positive movement where we're seeing capital
gains as well as pretty significant austerity measures being put in place giving us some confidence in those
customers. We will have to continue to address them as we move forward. But with so much still unknown at this
point, it's really hard to give a determination of kind of where it's going to resolve itself. But we do feel good about
those customers and where they're at as of today.
Bruce, anything you'd like to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the only thing and this is getting a little in the weeds and maybe Bryan want to jump in but if we have to
continue to provide ongoing support then I think you're going to see us turn some of those loans into TDRs.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
And in fact, we had a couple this quarter if you look at our tables in the back of the press release, I think we had
$9 million [indiscernible] (00:45:48) I had it on that table right in front of me, I think there were $9 million of
additional TDRs. And I believe, if I'm not wrong here, that those were a couple of lodging credits that did come up
for their second renewal. And based on the two and the credit, we may end up being TDR. So if that continues in
the next 130, that have yet to come through their deferral period and we do second, there could be some
additional TDRs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
The other comment that I might make, Andrew, is when this -- when the pandemic started, we like almost all
banks were fairly liberal in providing that first payment modification. The second go round, it's a complete re-
underwriting and it goes through our complete process. So we've had a lot of eyes on it as the second go round.
And if there is anything beyond that, it probably will even be moved into our workout room.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe first question on the branch optimization kind of the six branches, what are your thoughts on the cost
savings and maybe how much of that will be reinvested into like you said the ATM upgrade and some other
13


Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
(HTLF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
investments you have on the tech side. And then, Bruce, you kind of said 10% of branches are under review. I
guess I understand the meaning of that but out of those 10%, do you think a fair share of them will not pass
through view and will be consolidated?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Let me take that question first, Terry, and then Bryan can talk about the cost save. I think what we're doing right
now on those 10%, there's definitely probably half of those that we will either sell or consolidate. I think the
remaining 5%, it's really how long do we want to give those, because they might be in a growth market, but we
just over the last couple of years haven't been able to grow our bank into them. So it's really not – so it's – they're
in a good market, but for whatever reason, we haven't been able to make them grow the way that we want to, and
we don't have another branch close or it doesn't make sense for us to sell that one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And I think the question is in this environment going so digital, will they continue to grow? Do you need that to
grow among some of those markets as well, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And we really want to – part of our strategy as you know, we're much more commercially oriented with the small
business-oriented, and historically, small businesses made decision based upon how close branches were. We
really want to give it a little more time than just three or four months during this pandemic to see whether that
behavior changes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And, Terry, the other part of your question, the six branches had a cost base, kind of an annual base close to $3.5
million, people and – the predominance is people and the real estate costs. I think we'll probably get somewhere
between 60% and 70% of that cost to go away. We'll have to keep some of the people as we consolidate,
because we'll have a little bit more activity presumably going to the branch. So that's yet to be figured out to see
how that happens in this digital environment. But I would estimate probably conservatively 65% or so, right in that
ballpark, we ought to be able to [ph] see about that for sure (00:49:50).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And Terry, as you know, as we started to consolidate and prune our branch system a little over a year ago, we
have some pretty good historical numbers on when we consolidate branches, we've been maintaining over 90%
of those deposits. We modeled a much lower than that, but we've been able to maintain right around 90%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then just as a follow-up question, thanks for providing the non-pass rate that went from 8.1% to 8.7%.
I'm just curious that COVID kind of sensitive portfolio, I don't know if you have the details in front of you, but what
does the non-pass rated loans look like in, say, lodging or retail properties, some of those that you've called out
now for a couple of quarters, how much higher are those specific portfolios than the portfolio average?

Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No problem. Yes. Thank you. And while I don't have specific percentages as far as where they are individually for
each one as far as their non-pass percentages, again, the larger, the more impacted industries are the ones that
are driving most of the decreases from a COVID perspective, with lodging being one of the largest ones of all. [ph]
So because you noted (00:51:18) they're the one experiencing struggle or struggling from an industry as well, and
it's something we'll continue to monitor.
One of the things we're doing proactively is we're actually having monthly meetings where we go through and look
at all the individual credits, anything over – of any size really over $1 million and really [ph] going into an in depth
(00:51:35) both with their individual RMs as well as senior management, just to make sure we're really
understanding movement both pre going to non-pass, and post just to make sure we understand where they're at,

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, and I was just going to say, Terry, as you'll recall, we've always had kind of an outsized component relative

drives that a little bit.

Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. How is it going today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A

Good, Damon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good, Damon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good. So first question, just wanted to kind of circle back on the provision and kind of the outlook there, but
before that, could you just explain a little bit why the reserve for the unfunded commitments was down to $3.1
million this quarter? Is that just because of you had lower balances that you've released some of that reserve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, it's two things. The loans coming down, obviously that had some effect on the commitments. We also, as
Bruce mentioned, had quite a few construction loans that moved out or that moved up into their permanent
owner-occupied or CRE category, and those tend to have a little bit low – once they move, they have a little bit
lower reserve. We have a higher reserve rating – rate on our construction loans, and so that mix combination in
the lower caused that to go down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it, okay. And then as we try to think about the provision going forward, just kind of given the commentary
about potential for elevated net charge-offs in the coming quarters and kind of ongoing economic uncertainties, I
mean, it's probably fair to assume we're not going to see a provision as low as this quarter, but do you think we'd
kind of go back somewhere closer to what we saw the first half of the year?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
I don't think it's as high as the first half. If you step back and assume that we don't get the $3 million or so less on
the investment or on the unfundeds. We have close to $5 million provision for the – just the regular loans on the
books. I would suspect somewhere between there and $10 million – yeah, $10 million, [ph] getting my decimal
points (00:54:20) right, somewhere between that $5 million and $10 million is probably what we're looking after
the next couple quarters, and then once you get past that and we do get to more normal times, then it's really just
loan growth changes and hopefully not a lot of charge-offs or changes in credit quality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I think you said that the reserve or the ACL, I should say, ex-PPP loans was like 1.48% this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So that's the level you're comfortable with just kind of giving some of the weaknesses in – across the footprint and
just the rising spike of the virus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, I mean, you never know, right? One of the things that I did is I looked back, what was the worst year that we
had during the Great Recession, we never had a year of more than 1.4% of loans for charge-offs. And it doesn't
feel like we're at this – at as bad a spot right now. So going in, I think we're in pretty good shape. But obviously, if
we don't pull out of this, if things continue to just trudge along and businesses can't keep going and there isn't
enough stimulus, then things could change. That's part of the reason why what we didn't do, Damon, was we
probably – if we'd have just done the math on CECL with the forecasts coming – looking a little bit better than they
did last quarter, we probably could have just taken more a smaller provision. We don't think that was prudent
given all the uncertainties, we wanted to leave that – those factors where they were, which was on the high side,
just to make sure that we didn't get a false positive here, and that this does get worse instead of really get better.
And that gives us more room to take some additional charge-offs if that were to happen. So – and it's kind of a
long-winded answer, but I really do think in the next quarter or two, unless something changes that I don't see, we
should be, I think, somewhere in that $5 million to $10 million range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then on the margin, I may have missed this, but can you kind of just walk me down the 30 basis point
quarter-over-quarter decline? I know you said [ph] you added (00:56:34) liquidity, but was that entirely liquidity?
Was there a drag from PPP? Were there any other factors in there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think we had both – and I'm just looking through [ph] a whole thing that I did another sheet paper
(00:56:48). So PPP loans, the purchase accounting was the 10 basis points, again, PPP loans was about 9 basis
points, or it was 10 basis points last quarter, so it was about the same, but that yield is 2.65%, so it does pull
17

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2020
down our net interest margin. You have loans, both the volume and rates were down in loans, ex-PPP and ex-
purchase accounting. Investments, you have volume up but rates down. And then [ph] there was left (00:57:27)
from the liabilities with rates down and volume up. So, combination of a lot of things, I would say it's mostly
liquidity and the fact that we have had a shift towards a lower earning asset in the assets of that being

Lynn B. Fuller
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Towanda. In closing, again, we were very pleased with our financial performance for the third quarter,
and we set a number of new records. First and foremost, net income available to common shareholders of $45.5
million was the best quarter in our history. Earnings per diluted common share of $1.23 was our second best
quarter for earnings per share. Our record efficiency ratio at 54.67% for the quarter and 57.28% year-to-date was
the lowest in our history. Our assets reached a new record high of $15.6 billion, with $3 billion in growth over the
last four quarters. Our balance sheet remains extremely liquid, all capital ratios remained strong, and credit issues
remained relatively benign. 10 of our 11 charters achieved our goal of $1 billion or more in assets this last quarter,
and last, we're excited to welcome our new merger partners, AimBank of West Texas and the four Johnson Bank
branches in Phoenix, Arizona. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and hope you can join us again for
our next quarterly conference call in late January 2021. Have a good evening, everyone.
