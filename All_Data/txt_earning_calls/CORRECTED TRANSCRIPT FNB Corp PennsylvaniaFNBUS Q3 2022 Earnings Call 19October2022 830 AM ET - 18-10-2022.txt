Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. F.N.B.'s third quarter operating earnings per share
totaled a record $0.39, increasing 26% on a linked-quarter basis. The success of this quarter was highlighted by
record revenue, high-quality loan and deposit growth, digital technology enhancements, and continued positive
credit quality performance.
We were also pleased to receive all regulatory approvals for our pending merger with UB Bancorp, and we
anticipate the merger to close and convert in December of this year. We are looking forward to welcoming Union
Bank employees and clients to FNB. We are confident that they will benefit from our deep product suite and
robust digital tools.
Revenue totaled $380 million, led by 17% growth in net interest income, driven by solid loan growth, favorable
deposit mix, and the asset-sensitive position of our balance sheet. Our fee-based businesses contributed to over
$82 million, once again, demonstrating the importance of our long-term strategy of building diversified sources of
income. Record revenue, coupled with well-managed expenses, led to our historically low efficiency ratio of 49%,
as well as double-digit positive operating leverage for the third quarter. As we plan for 2023, we remain keenly
focused on risk management, expense control, diversification of revenue, and continuing to generate positive
operating leverage.
FNB again delivered double-digit annualized linked-quarter loan growth, with total loans ending at nearly $28.5
billion. Consumer loans grew $547 million, driven by adjustable rate and Physicians First mortgage loans.
Physicians First mortgage product continued its success and accounted for 39% of the linked-quarter growth as
we leverage the investments in the eStore with the digital Physicians First offerings.
Commercial loans increased $189 million linked-quarter, with annualized growth of 9% and 2% in C&I and CRE,
respectively. While growth was spread across the entire FNB footprint, the Cleveland and North Carolina markets
contributed the largest increases.
Deposits increased $413 million linked-quarter, or 4.9% annualized. We ended the quarter with noninterest-
bearing deposits accounting for 35% of total deposits. And Union Bank will enhance our overall position by
contributing a higher proportion of noninterest-bearing deposits.
Another area of continued success this quarter was with our digital channels, where eStore visits increased over
120% year-over-year in September and monthly visits averaged over 37,000. We continue to expand our digital
offerings for both our retail and business customers as we launch eStore online deposit applications for multiple
business deposit products beginning in November. Next year, we will introduce enhancements to our mobile
application, including real-time alerting capabilities and an update to our CardGuard debit card control service.
Both features enhance our customers' ability to manage their account balances.
Lastly, it is important to highlight the strong position of FNB's balance sheet in a time when leading indicators
point to potential economic softening. Our credit culture has been consistent, maintaining uniform underwriting

standards through all parts of the economic cycle. That same credit culture served us well during the great
recession, when our loss rates meaningfully outperformed our peers.
The credit team monitors the portfolio, not only through typical historical analysis, but also uses prospective
trends and analytics to identify any emerging risks. They also run various stress tests during their comprehensive
reviews to evaluate our risk management systems and portfolio performance.
Further mitigating risk and supporting our growth strategy is the geographic diversity of our footprint. Our
presence in seven states and the District of Columbia provides FNB access to high-growth metropolitan areas
and a variety of high-quality opportunities. Our numerous markets allow FNB to meet our growth objectives while
still adhering to our conservative underwriting standards. This key risk management objective has been an
important driver for our expansion strategy, as well as our unique business model.
We continue to prudently manage our capital well. As of last quarter, our CET1, TCE and reserve coverage ratios,
all ranked at or above peer median. While it is too early to know this quarter's results for our peer set, we expect
that we will continue to maintain capital and reserve coverage ratios at or above the median, once again
demonstrating our solid position within the banking industry.
FNB is well-positioned for a potential economic slowdown, with conservative management of our diversified loan
portfolio and the strength of our reserve coverage and capital ratios.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to provide additional detail of our asset quality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, with our credit portfolio favorably
positioned, following stable performance on both the quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis.
Our key credit metrics ended September with delinquency remaining at very favorable levels, while we saw
further reductions in non-performing and classified credits. Additionally, net charge-offs remained low and
continue to track well, following two consecutive quarters of very favorable results.
I would like to cover the GAAP asset quality highlights for the quarter, and then I will provide a brief update on the
upcoming UB Bancorp acquisition scheduled to close in Q4. Finally, I'll offer some color around the
macroeconomic environment, and the steps we're taking to proactively manage risk in our credit book to better
position us as we look to the quarters ahead.
Let's now review our third quarter results. Total delinquency ended September at 59 basis points, remaining
nearly flat compared to the last quarter's historically low level, up only 1 basis point. The increase was driven by
early-stage past dues tied to the runoff of the PPP credits still in process.
Non-accrual levels improved by nearly $5 million on a linked-quarter basis, with NPLs and OREO down 3 bps,
ending September at a solid 32 basis points, which reflects the tireless efforts of our workout teams to
aggressively address and resolve problem assets.
Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $2.8 million or 4 basis points annualized, with year-to-date net charge-offs
through the 9 months of $4.3 million or 2 bps annualized. Funded provision expense totaled $10.1 million, up $3

million linked-quarter, to support strong loan growth, as well as some model build tied to updated macroeconomic
factors and a continued decline in forecasted prepayment speeds.
Our reserve at the end of September totaled $385 million or 1.34%, down 1 basis point versus the prior quarter,
as credit quality results remained favorable. Our NPL coverage position further strengthened to 440%.
Now, turning to the UB Bancorp acquisition that is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. We remain on track
with our established conversion process, and we continue to closely track and monitor the loan portfolio and its
credit performance through Legal Day One. We do not anticipate any material impact to our corporate credit
metrics or loan risk profile as the portfolio remains in line with our expectations from due diligence.
As we welcome the team from UB, we look forward to deepening our relationships with the UB customer base
and the product offerings available to meet their banking and lending needs.
Let's now switch gears and discuss the evolving macroeconomic environment, specifically some of the measures
we've taken to manage credit risk and position our book moving forward.
As I've shared in the past, our credit philosophy is to take a holistic approach, beginning with consistent and
prudent underwriting across the footprint and throughout economic cycles. As we continue to execute on our loan
growth strategies and our lending pipelines convert, we actively monitor our concentrations of credit and asset
mix on a continuous basis to maintain a diverse and balanced loan book that fits within our desired loan risk
profile.
With the ongoing investments we've made in our credit systems and expansion of our risk analytics, we can make
strategic, data-driven decisions to better manage and mitigate risk in the book. Furthermore, our bankers remain
in close contact with our customers to understand the challenges and headwinds they face, allowing us to identify
signs of stress resulting from ongoing elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and the standing labor, supply chain
and energy-related challenges across various industries and markets. These factors are carefully analyzed and
addressed in underwriting as macroeconomic and market-specific conditions continue to evolve with our core
credit philosophy remaining front and center.
In closing, we are very pleased with the continued strength, consistency, and favorable positioning of our credit
portfolio following a successful third quarter. As we look to finalize the UB Bancorp acquisition in the months
ahead and close out the year strong, we remain vigilant of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and will
continue to proactively and aggressively manage our credit portfolio each and every day. As we look ahead, we
remain committed to our consistent approach to underwriting, which has proven itself well throughout prior
economic cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on the third quarter's financial results and offer
guidance for the remainder of the year. The third quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled a
record $135.5 million, or $0.38 per share. After adjusting for $2.1 million of merger-related expenses, net income
reached $137.2 million, or $0.39 per share.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
The growth in the balance sheet, driven by loans and investment securities that were largely funded through
deposit growth, brought assets to $43 billion at period end. Investment securities totaled $7.2 billion, with a fairly
even split between AFS and HCM. During the quarter, we largely reinvested our securities cash flows, which was
around $100 million per month, while staying in the 3.5% to 4.5% duration area.
Period-end total loans increased $736 million linked-quarter, or 10.4% annualized, including an increase of $547
million in consumer loans and $189 million in commercial loans and leases. Commercial loans saw another
quarter of healthy production, with year-to-date activity 7.5% higher than the same period in 2021. With such
strong production, the 90-day pipeline has softened a bit relative to last quarter.
Consumer loan growth was driven by strong organic residential mortgage activity across our footprint, with
particularly strong growth in the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic regions. The Physicians First mortgage program
accounted for $141 million, or 39%, with the increase in the mortgage balance on a linked-quarter basis. Indirect
lending increased 10.5% linked-quarter, as we saw more seasonal activity in that space, as well as an increased
supply of vehicles. Indirect book is predominantly higher quality prime paper.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $33.9 billion, an increase of $413 million linked-quarter, or 4.9% annualized.
The deposit mix continues to be favorable, with noninterest-bearing deposits comprising 35% of total deposits at
quarter end. Long-term debt increased $347 million following the August 2022 issuance of $350 million in three-
year senior notes. We plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which
excludes the extinguishment of debt. On the income statement, net interest income totaled a record $297.1
million, an increase of $43.4 million, or 17.1%, reflecting growth in average earning assets and benefits from the
higher interest rate environment as our net interest margin increased 43 basis points to 3.19%.
Managing deposit costs continues to be an ongoing focus. While the costs of interest-bearing deposits increased
29 basis points from last quarter, they remained fairly low at 57 basis points. In terms of deposit betas year-to-
date, we have a cumulative beta of 12.5% on total deposits. As the Fed continues to increase rates, this creates
competitive pressure on deposit pricing and we are currently anticipating our deposit costs will increase in the
fourth quarter, bringing the total 2022 cumulative deposit beta to around 20%.
Turning to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income totaled $82.5 million, a slight increase from last
quarter. Capital markets income increased 12% linked-quarter, to a total of $9.6 million with solid contributions
from syndications, international banking and swap fees.
Service charges increased $1.3 million linked-quarter, largely due to growth in treasury management services,
interchange fees and higher customer activity. Mortgage banking operations income decreased to $1 million, and
sold mortgage lines declined $111.2 million, or 34.2%, as consumer preferences shifted to adjustable rate
mortgages we are holding on balance sheet. On an operating basis, non-interest expense increased $2.2 million,
or 1.2%, compared to the prior quarter, excluding merger-related expenses of $2.1 million and $2.0 million in the
third and second quarters of 2022, respectively.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.8 million, reflecting reduced vacancy rates and higher production
and performance-related incentives. Marketing decreased $1.4 million due to the timing of digital advertising and
campaigns for our Physicians First program in the prior quarter. Overall, efficiency ratio came down to a record
49.4%, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter ratio of 55.2% and the year ago quarter's result
of 55.4%.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Tangible book value per common share was $8.02 at September 30, a decrease of $0.08 per share from June 30.
This change reflected the impact of AOCI, reducing the current quarter's tangible book value per share by $1.08,
compared to $0.72 at the end of the prior quarter, which was largely mitigated by the higher level of earnings for
the quarter. The increased unrealized losses in the AFS portfolio, due to rising interest rates, will accrete back into
capital over time and securities mature or prepay.
Lastly, as Vince mentioned, we are expecting the UB Bancorp acquisition to close and convert in December of
this year. Their balance sheet continues to trend within our expectations, and we are excited to add their low cost
deposit base in a higher rate environment.
Now, let's turn to guidance, which excludes the announced UB Bancorp acquisition. We increased our full-year
guidance for loans to mid-teens growth with underlying organic growth in the high-single to low-double digits on a
year-over-year spot basis. Total deposits are projected to grow mid- to high-single digits on a year-over-year spot
basis. Full-year net interest income is expected to be between $1.10 billion and $1.11 billion, with the fourth
quarter between $315 million to $325 million. Our guidance currently assumes 125 basis points of rate increases
for the fourth quarter.
We are increasing noninterest income to be between $317 million and $322 million, with the fourth quarter in the
mid to high-$70 million area. The revised full-year noninterest income guidance is due to higher-than-projected
third quarter income. Full-year guidance for noninterest expense was only revised to provide a tighter range of
$768 million to $773 million on an operating basis while maintaining our previous guide of $190 million to $195
million for the fourth quarter. This does not include the one-time expenses associated with acquisitions and
branch consolidations.
Full-year provision guidance was also revised to a tighter range of $25 million to $35 million, which does not
include the initial $19.1 million of provision related to Howard and is dependent on net loan growth and
macroeconomic factors during the fourth quarter. Lastly, the effective tax rate should be between 20% and 21%
for the fourth quarter, which does not assume any investment tax credit activity in the quarter.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince. We are pleased with this quarter's record revenue and earnings per share, as well as our loan
and deposit growth and our current level of non-interest bearing deposits. Our asset quality continues to perform
favorably with a low delinquency rate of 59 basis points and only 4 basis points of net charge-offs.
We continue to stay focused on changes to the economic environment and remain confident in our ability to
manage through potentially challenging macroeconomic conditions. Our FNB employees have performed
admirably throughout uncertain times, and I know that they will remain dedicated to fulfilling our commitment to all
of our stakeholders. To them, I extend my sincere gratitude at their collective efforts for what drives our
performance, and I look forward to working alongside our dedicated team as we close out 2022.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll begin our question and answer session [Operator Instructions]
Our first question today comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Hey, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess, maybe just starting on asset sensitivity and the outlook for the – as we go into 2023, any thoughts on
starting to moderate that asset sensitivity with the UB deal coming on, like you said, that's going to add even more
DDA. How should we be thinking about what you're doing in terms of portfolio decisions to potentially look at
falling rates as we build out our models here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would tell you a couple of things, Jared. I mean, over the course of 2022, with various strategies, which is
our exposure to downside rates as you look ahead from here, we've reduced our cash position, added massive
duration in the loan side through mortgage and securities books. Plus, we've executed about $1 billion or so and
received fixed swaps to protect us on the downside and in the midst of kind of looking at potential other
opportunities to put some more derivatives on potentially to protect us from downside movement in rates next
year that's expected.
So, it's happened organically outside of that $1 billion. And I think the way we're positioned today, there's still a
good amount of benefit to come from the expected movement in rates as we get into the fourth quarter and then
into next year. And we'll capture that, obviously, in the guidance for 2023. But there's still upside to the margin
and to the net interest income as you look into the fourth quarter for sure, given the overall asset sensitive
position of the balance sheet.
And I would just say again, too, that over time, we've kind of foregone some short-term earnings to kind of
position the balance sheet so that we would get that benefit from rising rates when it ultimately did come. We've
stayed short in our investment portfolio. We have consistently had a 50/50 split between AFS and HCM, which
helps on the AOCI impacts that everybody's experiencing right now. So, I think some of those tactics that we've
taken in the past and strategies are benefiting as we sit here today and as we look ahead from here.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. So then, on the deposits, great beta performance this quarter. Could you give us an update?
Anything that we should think about with the deposit growth this quarter? Is there any seasonality there that could
roll off? What were spot rates at the end of the quarter? And as we look forward, what do you think the through-
the-cycle beta could be on the overall blended deposit base with UB there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say a couple of things. I mean, we do have seasonality in our municipal business that we have
every year and kind of swings, I say, to $300 million to $500 million as you go kind of from peak to trough and go
through the year. And that still builds through October into November. So, that kind of normal seasonality is there.
But on top of that, we continue to have good success adding new accounts on the retail side, as well as on the
commercial side with the markets we're in. We continue to win, not just lending side, but also bringing in the
operating accounts. So, that's clearly a benefit to the overall deposit growth that we've consistently had. And our
DDAs continuing to build over time. There's been a focus – there's a new slide that we added. If you look back in
2009 forward, from 16% up to 35%, and it's been continuously moving up. It's a big focus in the company, for
sure.
As far as the betas, I mean, the liquidity to banking system is still there. We still have $1.8 billion in excess cash
on our balance sheet. As like others, we're starting to see more pressure on deposit rates as the Fed continues to
move. At this point, there's been very limited movement of our retail deposit rates, but definitely more frequent
conversations with the municipal business clients, where we've been making adjustments, particularly for those
that have core relationship with us.
We have not lost any clients, which is important. I think the commercial customers, the municipal customers
having conversations with us aren't just closing accounts and moving somewhere else. So, I think it speaks to the
relationships that people have built up over time. As you know, we have a new slide that we added in there. I
mean, so far, cumulative beta for total deposits was at 12.5% at the end of September. Our forecast is to be
around 20% for total deposits at the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then I guess just finally for me, on the expense side, as we look into 2023, any more update on
sort of the pace of hiring in the D.C., Northern Virginia area? Is that going to be an area of continued growth; and
then, potentially even Richmond, with that hiring you did down there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, our hiring in D.C. has been underway. So we don't expect a particular [indiscernible] (00:28:17) in
that area. There are several retail locations that are coming online. So it could be a little bit of an expense pickup,
but it's not significant relative to the total base. When you look at expenses overall, we've been engaged in a
multi-year expense takeout exercise. So we targeted certain levels, and then we achieved them. And we did it
repeatedly over the last three years.

We expect to continue to stay focused on it. There is some opportunity within our expense base to continue to
manage expenses down in the face of inflation, so we can offset some of the natural increases that we're going to
see. I think from an occupancy – or a vacancy perspective, vacancy has been reasonable for us. The culture at
the company is such that I think our employees are genuinely happy and are committed to the company.
We've taken some actions to increase salaries here and there, and continue to take care of the employees as we
move along. So we weren't caught off guard. If you recall, we had significant increases in the retail space over the
last five years or so in salary expenses to retain those people, and with commercial banking and a few upgrades
that we reassessed throughout time.
So our vacancy rate has been within historical ranges. It on the upper end, but it's been within historical ranges,
so not really an outlier. But I hope that helps. We didn't give guidance for next year on expenses.
I'll turn it back over to Vince, if you want to add something.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, I would just add, to Vince's this point, over the last four years, including this year, we had $70 million of
cost savings that we've realized. It's always a focus every year as far as coming up with what that target should
be. And it really comes out of just continuing to renegotiate with vendors, optimizing space throughout the
footprint, as well as a variety of process improvement initiatives that is just kind of ongoing. So we've always had
that disciplined focus, and we'll continue to have that.
And as you can see from the guidance this year that it has been consistent is that $190 million to $195 million and
managing expenses within that band, and that will continue to be a focus for us and creates the positive operating
leverage that's in the double digits that we were able to generate this quarter that we expect will continue to be at
very good levels in coming quarters here.

Yeah. I would just say that, as I commented on minutes ago, I mean there's still upside in the margin from here
with the continued Fed actions. I think our team has, across the board, done a very nice job managing the deposit
costs on the retail and the commercial and the municipal side. So that's very much a focus for us, given the
excess cash we have on the balance sheet and just kind of operating the company. We have a very active
process every week, through our pricing committee, that kind of optimize where those rates should be.
So, I mean, when we give guidance for next year, obviously, we'll give you kind of a outlook for the full year, as
well as to quarterly half. But I think there's still upside – definitely more upside from here on the margin and net
interest income. And then, as I said earlier, we've taken some action to protect us for when rates do come down.
So there's still plenty of upside, but put some protection in place to help with that when it happens. And none of us
know for sure exactly when that's going to happen.
And I should comment, too, that the guidance has an additional 125 basis points in rate hikes, as we mentioned
on that slide, in the fourth quarter. That's what's kind of baked into our outlook.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Shifting gears here then over to credit quality. Obviously, that's been really strong for you so far; things
looking very clean in the numbers. Your comment's very positive, based on what's available now. But where are
you kind of most concerned or looking at most closely in terms of the loan books, given what we're expecting here
going into the next cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Daniel. One of the focuses of our team today is on the economically sensitive areas. And we feel that those
are the small business portfolio, as well as the indirect portfolio on the consumer side. Those books of business
have continued to perform really well. Delinquency, flat quarter-over-quarter in both of them. Charge-offs did tick
up a little bit, with used car prices coming down in the indirect book as expected, but those are the areas of focus
at the moment. And like I said, we're pleased with how they've held up to this point and expect them to perform
well, even though there are headwinds in those areas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We've also been underlining – we've been stressing interest rate sensitivity, right, Gary, within the commercial
real estate portfolio. So...

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, and across the C&I book as well. I mean, we're pretty aggressive with our interest rate stresses. I mean,
we're underwriting CRE transactions today at north of 7.5%. And then, we're stressing it from there. So we've got
some pretty heavy stresses built into the front side of the underwriting equation, and the oversight management of
the book, and the stresses that we place on those portfolios.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And we've said this before on other calls. I mean, Gary stated it in the prepared comments. We manage credit risk
consistently through cycles. We don't go crazy during the good times and loosen structure; and we don't tighten in
a crazy way during the bad times. And for conservative underwriting upfront, better LTVs. If you look at the
consumer book, the credit scores and the LTVs are very solid, I'd say, in most cases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, the average there is in the high-700s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, basically, what that does is it protects your downside as you move through the cycle. And when others are
returning capital and shrinking their balance sheet, it gives us an opportunity to selectively grow our balance
sheet. And that happens throughout the last cycle. We reported multiple quarters of loan growth when the industry
was shrinking, and our credit performance was pretty darn good.
So I'm very confident in our team. I know we have – there's a lot of uncertainty moving forward. We're not naïve to
it. We monitor portfolios prospectively. We do all kinds of things from an analytics perspective and stressing
perspective. And we're very active at grading our credits accurately and quickly.
So what you're seeing from us is it's close to real-time as we can get it. I think things are pretty good today. We're
looking forward. And Gary's team is being very cautious as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Terrific. I appreciate all that color. And then kind of just a related follow-up on reserves. How much would you say
the qualitative side is impacting the level of where you are right now in reserves? Just kind of thinking through
how changes in macro forecast could impact reserves going forward. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The qualitative piece of the reserve today, Daniel, is right at about 25%. We would expect that to move
down slightly as we go forward, and some of the other quantitative models take effect. During the quarter, as I
mentioned in the remarks, the loan growth naturally took some provision expense, a pretty good chunk of it. We
did see slower prepayment speeds, which are naturally extending the lives of some of those portfolios and
naturally the impact provision there from a CECL standpoint.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Our economic forecasts have seen some softening. These are quantitative models in our models around CRE
and housing variables. So that did take a little bit of provision expense as well. That all said, those builds were –
on that side of the equation were primarily offset by improvements in credit quality, which ultimately drew the
reserve down 1 basis point at 1.34%, as mentioned. All told, credit quality continues to be a driver there and loan
growth is going to drive the provision going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Our reserve position relative to our peer group is still very positive, very favorable. And I attribute that to
gradation, staying on top of the credits, making sure we're understanding where we are from a risk perspective
and a gradation standpoint. I don't know if, Gary, you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I would agree with that. I mean we viewed the pandemic as not something that was finite and totally ending.
So, we were a little cautious around that. And I go back to a year-and-a-half back when we were really starting to
get worried about the inflationary signs that we were seeing, back in early-2021. And we felt that it was
appropriate to be prudent with the reserve, as opposed to releasing large chunks of it. So, we managed it, I think,
appropriately and accordingly. And we're pleased with the strength of it today.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
A question for Vince C. So, the non-interest bearing deposit mix has been very strong. Just wondering how – is
that 35% level sustainable from here? Or are you factoring in some attrition, as you – in your 20% cum beta
through the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Casey, this is Vince Delie. We focused on that historically to grow that position. I mean, if you go back, and, I
think, if you look at the chart within the deck, you can see the deposit mix has shifted very favorably. That's been
an effort, a multiyear effort. That type of – these changes are built into our DD&A. I mean, basically, have
incented people to focus more on low cost deposit gathering. They work pretty diligently, strategically to secure
treasury management relationships. So, that 35% we're hoping is sticky. Have said that, I mean, I'm sure as you
move forward in a rising rate environment, there's pressure on noninterest-bearing deposits, so it's reflected in the
deposit beta side that we gave. Right, Vince?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Okay. And then...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Look, a very solid – the other thing I will add, Casey, is our small acquisition is also additive, because their our
deposit mix is also favorable. It's even higher percentage of demand deposit is higher than ours. So, I guess 42%,
right, 40-ish...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That announcement. Yeah, it's 42%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, it's going to be additive from that standpoint as we move into a period of elevated rates.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And then, on the cash position, I think you mentioned an excess cash of $1.8 billion. What is
sort of like the bare minimum that you want to run at? Just a reminder there so we get a sense as to – as when
that does run low, you're a little bit more like – the use of wholesale borrowings becomes more prevalent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Casey, that's really what we would consider excess cash, that $1.8 billion. We have a certain core level of cash
on the balance sheet that you would typically see. But that $1.8 billion that I referenced is truly the excess cash.
So that can go down to zero.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. So, decent cushion from here. And then just lastly, on the loan pipeline, obviously, a strong result
here. It sounds like the pipeline is a little bit softer. Just wondering if there's any – a little more color on any
verticals, or is it just below the lighter after a strong production quarter? And then also, the indirect auto has had a
very nice growth over the last two quarters. Is that seasonal in nature, or is that going to slow down, or is that
momentum going to continue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I'll answer the question – the first question about the overall pipeline. I'll let Gary talk about indirect auto
because it reports up through Gary. But the pipelines in general, they were current robust leading into the last two
quarters actually. And we've been able to product some pretty significant loan growth. As we close out those
transaction, the pipeline has interacted, which is pretty natural. We're at a point in the cycle where you typically
don't see a surge in commercial borrowing requests. It's seasonal period basically. And from a cyclical
perspective, I wouldn't expect to see a surge in demand, particularly in the C&I book as we move towards the end
of the year.
I think those pipelines will refill. I mean, they're not terribly low. They were – they're at a decent level. They've just
been reduced because of all the stuff we closed in the 90-day bucket. So my hope is that we're able to go out –
given the size of our footprint, the fact that we have fairly significant share across seven states and the District of
Columbia, I would expect us to be able to go out and continue to generate high quality earning assets. That goes
for both consumer and commercial. And I know that our regional presidents, while they face a very significant
amount of competition quarter after quarter, they're very optimistic about their ability to execute in the market that
they're in. Gary, I don't know, do you want to comment on indirect auto?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, sure, Vince. Thanks. The second and third quarters, Casey, are our seasonally high periods for us. So we
do normally see that type of spike in volume during the middle part of the year. We've really been focused over
the last month, month and a half, a couple months on enhancing our margins in that business. I would expect as
we move through Q4 here that we'll see lower volumes there. At the end, we're focused, as always, on high
quality paper. So I would expect that to seasonally dip for those couple of reasons as well as our focus on
enhancing those margins.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, understood. And just – sorry – one last one housekeeping question. The tax rate guide is up a little bit, 20%
to 21%. Is this the level we should assume carrying into 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It will always be dependent on the level of investment tax credit activity that we execute and we'll continue to be
active on those types of transactions. But what we see in a activity in the fourth quarter, so that's why we're in,
what I would say, is a normalized 20% to 21% – absent those types of transactions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The 20% to 21% with a benefit provided that there's some taxes in transactions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We expect – there's something we had teed up in the fourth quarter that we expect to happen next year. So
that will create some benefit to that tax rate, but pretty clean rate.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to ask just first if you could maybe just give us a quick refresher on the Physicians First mortgage
program, kind of the structure, the type, the use case. Just a little bit of a refresher as it's clearly seen some nice
growth recently for you guys. Just wondering if you could give us a rundown of kind of how that product works
generally.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we started with a mortgage product that had a more advantageous LTV, basically, just the basic premise of
it for physicians, medical professionals, doctors that are starting out typically or loaded with student loan debt. So,
we made some adjustments to the underwriting of loan debt product to assist the physicians in securing their
homes.
We migrated it from a purely physical origination process to a digital origination process. And we bundle a series
of other products, medical practice loan, which is a small business loan, the student loan refinance product with
the depository product, and then, the first mortgage product, and we call that our Physicians First Bundle. And it's
on our digital eStore, which is our e-commerce website that we set up, and I referenced it in the prepared
comments. And then we use that platform with our originators to go after physicians globally. And that portfolio
has performed extraordinarily well, over time, it's grown nicely. Gary, I don't know, you might comment on some of
the credit...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, the delinquencies in that portfolio were very near zero. High FICO scores, very solid debt to income
ratios. I mean, it's a high-quality book of business, and we continue to see good opportunities there. The bundling
of the programs and the opportunities in a small business practice lending business, I think, are ahead of us, as
well as some of the student loan [ph] refi (00:50:09) opportunities there. So we expect that to continue to bear fruit
as we move forward with that program.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I was going to say competitively, do you guys feel like that there is a little bit of an edge you guys have here or a
lot of other banks in this space are focused on this niche? Or is there room for you guys if you kind of take some
market share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, there are other banks focused on this niche. I mean, just about every competitor we have offers a similar
mortgage product. The difference is the way we've organized our approach to gathering those clients. We use
data analytics, we use our digital tools, the eStore. Like we said in our prepared comments, we had 37,000
customers visit our site. So, we've created traffic on our website, which translates into the ability to promote
certain product and services. And then when we engage in digital advertising and traditional advertising
methodology, we can direct them to our portal. So when you look at it, the Physicians First eStore page, for
example, it grew to 900 visits per month from zero. So we just stood that up not that long ago, a couple of
quarters ago. So, that supported the growth year-over-year of 18.2% in that category in terms of views on that
site. And it supports the overall views.
So, when we use that tool, that digital tool, we're creating traffic that enables customers to look for solutions. And
then we're applying, in some instances, our analytics tools to present products to customers as they visit the site.
So, they put the Physicians First package, the mortgage package in the shopping cart, and then the other items
pop up. And I'd say people that purchase this product typically look at these other products. So it's led to more
views and ease of marketing and a higher visibility, right? So we're attributing some of our success to obviously
the people matter most, but some of our success is directly attributable to our digital strategy and the eStore
concept that we've developed.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then just lastly and unrelated, just on the capital markets fees, which were pretty solid in the quarter. Is it
reasonable to think that, in the current environment, there's room for that to kind of continue to be elevated with
rates moving and some of the economic uncertainty and everything? Are you seeing a little extra engagement
from the commercial side there? Or just a level of extra color there, if you don't mind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It's a great question. I mean, I think we're a little bit of an anomaly, because we have a pretty broad offering
for our size. So, we have a debt capital markets group that participates in bond economics. They support our
large corporate calling activity or large corporate bankers. We have syndications effort that's outsized, I think, for
a bank our size. In fact, our syndications revenue has doubled, right, Vince?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
More than double, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
More than double over the last year. So it's a sizable contributor. We do hedging. We throw international into the
mix because we do some hedging for international clients. That's grown nicely. The derivatives business is a core
business for the company. That's more volatile because of the changes in interest rates and demand from a loan
perspective. That both impacts that area. But we have a very strong team and have had great success structuring
products for clients to protect them in both up and down interest rate cycles.
So sure, I mean, I'm bullish on our capital markets platform, in general, over the long term. I believe there is
significant upside over the long term. In the short run, you're going to see variability. It's lumpy because of the
changes in rates. But...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think capital markets is very early.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Debt capital markets is early. Syndications is – there's still upside there. Even though we performed
extraordinarily well this year, there's upside. There's always an opportunity in the debt capital markets area
because of the activity that goes on with our larger borrowers in terms of the issuance of debt, bonds; not bank
debt, where we're out of debt, but bond debt.

And then, as we've grown as a company, our credit appetite in terms of forward position is growing. And in order
for us to compete more effectively against larger competitors and to hold our own against some of the regional
players that we compete with day-in and day-out, we built out our syndications capability. We have very strong

stronger your bankers are, the more opportunities you have in that space. And that's why, over the long haul, I'm
very optimistic about that area, barring economic headwinds.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yes. So I just had one question, really, on loan yields. I was just curious what the loan yield was for new loans in
the month of – this month of October. And also wanted to know if you can give us color on what you're seeing
from a loan spread dynamic. Are you seeing more competitive pressures? Or are you actually seeing the
expansion in loan spreads, given kind of what you've been able to price out there in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I can comment on [indiscernible] (00:57:13), and then maybe ask Gary or Vince to comment on the spreads for
current loans. Yeah, the new loans made during the third quarter came on at a yield of 4.38%, which was up
significantly from 3.53% in the second quarter. And if you look at kind of the overall spot portfolio rate, it increased
87 basis points to 4.53% after increasing 46 basis points in the second quarter of 3.66%.

So the new rates, the way they're coming on, as you would expect, significantly higher, which bodes well for my
comments earlier about kind of the margin as you get into the fourth quarter and continue to build on the net
interest income there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
In terms of the spreads, we are seeing them strengthen. So we're seeing some benefit pretty much across the
board. High-quality paper is naturally bringing very, very low rates in terms of the strength of investment-grade
credits, but that has also moved up. So I would tell you that everything's up 20, 25 basis points, upwards of 50
basis points from a spread standpoint, depending upon asset class.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We're not a yield chaser, by the way. We focus, principally, on credit quality. So we like to do – even
though some transactions may be more thinly priced, the ability to produce results through cycles is directly
hinged on how creditworthy those borrowers are going in.
So while we try to benefit from higher yields in certain asset classes across a broader spectrum of lending, so we
have a portfolio. As of late, Gary, many of the C&I credits that we brought in were larger, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And more creditworthy. And the credit spreads on those deals are thinner. So anyway, just thought I'd bring that
up. That's in the C&I book. In the consumer book, again, we tend to chase higher-quality borrowers. But that's
going to impact your overall credit spreads and our perception of spreads. In other words, we're not out there
doing high-risk private equity deals with significant leverage, right? That's where you'll find the best yield. That's
not in our portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And Brandon, just a further comment to your question. So the 4.38% that I mentioned, that's the rate for new
loans for the entire third quarter. If we look at the month of September, loans came on at a 4.94%, relative to the
4.38% average for the quarter, so to kind of be responsive to your question about kind of more current. So that's
where we ended the quarter for the month of September.

Operator: Our next question comes from Manuel Navas from D.A. Davidson & Company. Please go ahead with
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey, good morning. I think most of my questions have been answered. But just can you describe any differences
you're seeing in terms of loan pricing or deposit pricing, just regionally? You talked a little bit about loan growth,
Cleveland being pretty strong, but just kind of can you continue that with loans and deposits, just in terms of
pricing competition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We're in some pretty intense markets. Our core markets are actually extraordinarily competitive. People
think it's the opposite. But Cleveland, Pittsburgh and even Baltimore are very competitive markets. I mean,
Cleveland has always been a tougher market to price in. As you move into the Southeast, while there are more
competitors, there tends to be more activity. So it kind of buffers the competitive environment slightly. But if you
looked overall, the variations are not that great, but there are variations. So I just pointed them out. But I think –
and that goes for both loans and deposits.
And as you look at the state of Pennsylvania where we compete, as you move across the state into Philadelphia,
credit spreads tend to narrow as you get closer to Philadelphia because it is more competitive and even more
competitive in that area. So once you cross into the Central PA into the Philadelphia market, the commercial
pricing becomes a little thinner. From a depository perspective, it's the same type of thing.
But we're really focused as a company on gathering demand deposits. This is a very strong deposit franchise. It's
evident in the results. You can see it in the trend that we've presented. Our objective here is to be the principal
operating bank for our clients. We're not out buying deposits to fund our operations.
So what that means is the commercial bankers are out. They're selling treasury management services. We're
getting the principal disbursement accounts. So we have balances that are typically used to pay for services or
are sitting for liquidity purposes for the company and demand deposit accounts.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I can tell you. I don't think we have that at our fingertips. But when you look at the deals that are coming in,
typically, a middle market commercial deal is anywhere from $1.75 to $2.50 in credit spread.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You know what, Brian, that's been fairly consistent. So if you want to convert that to a fixed rate yield, you have to
look at the yield curve, the – we focus on credit spreads in that space and kind of manage the groups that way
versus looking at an outright yield. They may look at fixed rate loan, they do a variable adjustable rate loan. So
we're kind of keying in on that credit spread. But that – I would say credit spreads have broadened slightly across
the board. I don't know what you...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. I mean, they're up, like I said, 25 to 50 basis points in some asset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then that new origination, the reason it's difficult to put your finger on what the yields would be in the
commercial book is because we run the broad spectrum of market from small business up to large corporate. So,
if we book a large corporate deal at LIBOR plus a $1.50 or $1.25, that's your spread, right? So, it's going to
reduce the yield in that quarter. But we look at it more broadly from a portfolio perspective than try to manage it
that way, and that helps us manage it as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I can't give you any more than that. I hope that helps you. But we're expecting credit spreads to continue to
broaden as we move through a more difficult period in the cycle.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Got you. No. That's helpful. And then maybe just the reinvestment rates for securities today, where are they at, I
guess, for the quarter, for September, just kind of how you're thinking about next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say just to make a few comments on that. The reinvestment rates averaged 3.83% for the quarter.
For the third quarter, it was up from 3.27% last quarter and 1.90% in the first quarter, as we know, if rates haven't
moved up. So the 3.83% compares to a roll off rate of 2.04%. So that kind of gives you a reference point there.
The duration of what we've invested on during the quarter was still in that kind of 4%, 4.2% level. If we look at
where we're investing today, we continue to take advantage of the market yields. We've been investing at about
4.80% as we sit here so far in October with the duration just a little bit south of 4%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. No, that's helpful. All right. Perfect. And then just how about – maybe just one for Gary on the
commercial real estate concentration levels, just is there any areas you guys are staying away from lending today,
just given maybe an increased focus here from the regulatory side on commercial real estate or just any thoughts
on if you're staying away from anything today and just kind of where the current concentration levels are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We've been extremely cautious for, I would say, the last year-and-a-half, a couple of years and beyond,
even in the retail space. So, we're doing very little volume around retail CRE. We do occasionally come across a
very strong transaction, with long-term leases, credit tenants, and those type of underwritings, and we'll continue
to pick our spots there. The other space is the office space, overly cautious there. I mean, it's been a space that
we identified very early on in the pandemic as one that's going to have an elongated tail around potential risk in
that space. So, again, similar as the retail, we'll find the odd transaction that is long-term lease to an extremely
strong credit type of tenant. And we'll move forward with a transaction like that, but very, very little volume.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have very little hospitality, the portfolio is tiny.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The hospitality – I mean, we don't – we haven't made a hospitality loan in five, six years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't think in all of my time in banking, I would – this portfolio, as it sits, is in a very good position moving into the
cycle that we're in. And I give that credit to Gary and his team. They've been – obviously, you want to grow the
book, you want to grow revenue, but when we're in choppy waters like this, this is one of the best places to be,
right? You've addressed risk within the portfolio, we're very conservative.

What Gary didn't say is we don't have a lot of urban large office buildings, we don't. We have office buildings, but
they're largely smaller suburban buildings. We haven't experienced the same level of vacancy. So, I think that
we're very well-positioned. Obviously, everybody is going to be facing in the industry a slowdown next year if that
occurs. And if we perform the way we have through other cycles, we will be in really good shape. So I think, we
have the same team. So hopefully, we're able to manage through this more effectively and outperform others.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't know – thank you. I don't know if you have any other questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No, I think that answers most about the real estate type. Just the last two, just general questions. Just on the –
your outlook on the loan growth side. I know you're not giving much outlook for 2023. But just are you seeing
more caution? It sounds like you're seeing more caution among the commercial customers, obviously, based on
where we are in the cycle and just economically. But is that how we should think about – at least as we look at
2023, that's probably what we would expect as you get a little bit deeper this quarter and share more next quarter.
But is that kind of a trend you're seeing among the customers today on the commercial side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think, the clients – you got to remember, we've all gone through a pretty significant turbulent time, with the
pandemic, it's pretty shocking to a lot of people, our client. So I think that they're thinking about things more
conservatively as we move into this cycle. Obviously, the economic headwinds are real. Inflation is real. The
supply chain disruption is real. I think our commercial customer base appears to be pretty realistic about revenue
expectations moving into next year, which ultimately translates into fixed charge coverage and performance on
our loans.
So, I'm hopeful that on the commercial side, the customer base that we have, we're relying on those management
teams to get us through just like we – our shareholders rely on us to get them through. So I think we have a very
strong customer base, we have very prudent customers. They think about their business. They manage leverage
appropriately, and that'll get them through a difficult time.
On the consumer side, the consumers appear to be in pretty good shape. I mean, there's obviously stressors out
there from an economic perspective. But globally, when we look at the performance of the portfolio, the
delinquency rate is low, the charge-off rates are low, I know those are lagging indicators. And then if we look at
cash positions within the consumer segment themselves, they appear to still be fairly healthy even though we
don't expect that to deplete over time with inflation. But I – with inflationary pressure and other things. But I think
we're in a very good position moving in to this next cycle. And we're very cautious. So I don't know how else to
leave it. So I may come across that way is because we are cautious.
In terms of pipelines, we manage our pipelines fairly rigorously. We do credit reviews upfront. So, that's really
going to be contingent upon what's going on from an economic perspective and over time how other capital

providers are impacted. So kind of tough to predict where the pipelines are going to go, but I feel pretty good
about where we are today. And the pipelines are – have softened. But a lot of it has to do with transitioning deal
flow. And they're still at reasonable levels heading into next year. So we'll see what happens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And just an additional note, Brian, just this – within the last week, I've been pulled into three new transactions, and
all of them, extremely strong. So, the pipelines can build rather quickly, based on some of the transactions that
we're able to look at these days. And I was very pleased with those three discussions and they're all moving
forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. No, that's helpful. And just the last one for me was just on capital. Just any changes in the outlook? Just,
kind of, where the – maybe where the capital levels ended in fourth quarter just post the Union deal and just how
you're thinking about the buyback, and just managing the capital levels today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No change in our strategy there. We continue to target CET1 ratio around 10%. The 9.8% estimated for
this quarter is up to 9.7%, as you saw on the slides. The strong earnings more than supported the asset growth
for the quarter, and the dividend payout ratio is at a very attractive level. We would expect to build CET1 ratio to
10% in the near-term, and then gradually build that ratio in 2023, just given, kind of, higher earnings generation
levels, we can benefit from the asset sensitive positioning.
Regarding the buybacks, it's still the same philosophy, Brian. I mean, our first and best use of capital is organic
loan growth. So, the level of buybacks will be dependent on that. We did not buyback any shares this quarter, but
we will be opportunistic as we go forward, given we still think there's significant value in our relative PE to the
peers. We made – outperform the peer significantly in recent periods, and we think there's still room for that PE
we need to expand relative to the peers. So, we will be opportunistic. But the overall philosophy is still the same.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And I don't know if someone asked earlier, but just – you talked about the positive operating
leverage. I mean, with the efficiency ratio being below 50% today, is that kind of an achievable – is that kind of a
sustainable level kind of given the outlook for what you're seeing with margins still trending higher here as you
kind of look over the next couple of quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would just say – I mean, for the fourth quarter, I will give guidance in January for next year. As I mentioned,
there's still upside in the net interest income. It's baked into our guidance and we'll continue to manage expenses
diligently as we always have. There's still – there's upside to that ratio or improvements to that ratio into the next
quarter. And then, next year, we'll cover that into guidance [indiscernible] (01:15:33).
