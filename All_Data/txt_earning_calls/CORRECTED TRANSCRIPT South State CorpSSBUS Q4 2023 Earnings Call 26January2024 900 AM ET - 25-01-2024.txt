Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thanks, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. You can see in the earnings release that
SouthState delivered a solid quarter that was consistent with our guidance. High level, it was another quarter of
steady loan and customer deposit growth, with mid-single digit growth in both. NIM dipped a couple basis points
but is leveling off, and capital ratios are growing nicely.
The end of the year is always a time for reflection. As we look back on 2023 and specifically the turmoil last
spring, it was a period that demonstrated the resilience of SouthState, particularly the resilience of our granular
deposit franchise, the resilience of our asset quality and the resilience of the high growth markets where we
operate. A new census report was issued last month, and not surprising, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina
and Georgia were all in the top five fastest-growing states in the country during 2023. And since the pandemic,
over 1 million people have moved to Florida.
SouthState is a company that was forged during the Great Recession, during a decade of rapid consolidation.
The culmination of that period was a merger of equals announced four years ago this month. That significant
event in our history was an opportunity to catch our breath and spend a couple years to retool the guts of the
bank, specifically in the areas of technology and risk management. Our goal was to strengthen the infrastructure
without sacrificing our decentralized and entrepreneurial culture.
It was painstaking work that affected every area of the bank. We upgraded 20 different technology platforms and
increased our annual technology spend by 76%. Annual spending on technology in 2024 is estimated to be $68
million more than it was in 2020. On the risk management side, our program has matured to meet the heightened
expectations of the OCC. We upgraded with experienced professionals from the big banks and strengthened the
three lines of defense.
During the first couple years, those technology and risk management changes took a toll on our employees and
impacted the customer experience, but it was short-term pain for long-term gain. So with a larger bank
infrastructure in place, our focus pivoted, in 2023, to making our employees and customers' lives better. We
needed to refine the new technology so that it was serving us rather than the other way around, and I think we've
been largely successful. Employee engagement is now back to the top quartile of our peers, and we're beginning
to leverage the power of the new technology.
Now, in 2024, as we approach the end of the COVID era, and hopefully, a more normal yield curve, we believe
we can deliver outsized shareholder returns in the future. It's a future that's possible because of the hard work
over the last few years. So, I'll close by thanking our team for preparing us for this next chapter.
I'll pass it back to Will now to walk you through the details on the quarter.

Thank you, John. As you noted, the fourth quarter was a good finish to a year in which SouthState reported solid
performance and soundness, profitability and growth while facing a relatively volatile environment. I'll touch on a
few details before we move to Q&A.
On the balance sheet, fourth quarter annualized loan growth of 5% brought our full-year growth to 7%. Customer
deposit growth, excluding the maturing brokered CDs we didn't replace of 5% annualized, approximately matched

the loan growth rate. For the full year, total deposits grew 2%, with customer deposits essentially flat. DDAs
represented 29% of total deposits at quarter end, down another percent from 30% last quarter, leaving us near
the levels we were pre-pandemic for DDA as a percentage of deposits.
Turning to the income statement, our 3.48% NIM was down 2 basis points from the prior quarter and consistent
with our 3.45% to 3.50% guidance. Loan yields in Q4 were up 12 basis points and deposits were up 16 basis
points in line with our 15 basis point to 20 basis point guidance. This brings our cycle-to-date loan beta to 36%
and our cycle-to-date deposit beta to 30%. Our net interest income of $354 million was essentially flat with the
third quarter.
For the full-year 2023 margin comparison versus 2022, 2023's NIM of [ph] 3.63% (06:20) was 26 basis points
higher than 2022's while the cost of deposits rose from 10 basis points in 2022 to 120 basis points in 2023 in a
period of 500 basis points of Fed rate hikes, not to mention the March crisis. While it's been a challenging period
in which to manage a financial institution balance sheet, I think our margin performance during this period of rapid
change really highlights the value of our core funding base.
Non-interest income of $65 million was down $8 million from Q3, and at 58 basis points [ph] of assets (06:54) was
in line with our 55 basis points to 60 basis points guidance. Correspondent revenue was $3.4 million after $12.7
million in interest expense on swap collateral [ph] per $16 million (07:06) in gross revenue, down approximately
$9 million from Q3. Wealth had a record quarter with revenue exceeding $10 million, and we had a strong quarter
in deposit fees similar to Q3 and last year's fourth quarter.
Mortgage revenue continued to be weak, though I'll compliment our leadership on their performance in this
challenged environment. We track various metrics versus the Mortgage Bankers Association Quarterly
Performance Report, and our team consistently outperforms the industry in several key metrics. Operating
expenses of $246 million, which excludes the $25.7 million for the FDIC special assessment, were in line with our
expectations and were above Q3 levels due to some of the items we mentioned in our third quarter call. Looking
ahead, we expect NIE for Q1 in the mid to high-240s, subject to normal variations in the expense categories
impacted by noninterest income and performance.
With respect to credit, we recognized [ph] $7.7 million (08:06) in net charge-offs in the quarter, bringing our year-
to-date total to $25 million or 9 basis points for the quarter and 8 basis points for the full year. Of the year's net
charge-offs, $7 million came from deposit accounts and $18 million from loans for approximately 6 basis points in
loan net charge-offs.
Our provision expense was $9.9 million for the quarter and $114 million for the year, leaving our ending total
reserve to remain approximately flat at 158 basis points of loans. And over the last two years, we've provisioned
$196 million against only $29 million in net charge-offs, so we've built our reserves appropriately under CECL in
advance of potential credit deterioration.
For overall asset quality trends, NPAs were up $8 million, driven by an increase in SBA loan non-accruals, which
are 75% or more government guaranteed. Special mention loans declined, and substandard loans increased. The
increase in over-90s is due to utility company storm repair receivables in our factoring business. These typically
turn slowly, and the majority of these have been collected since quarter end. Loan past-dues were down quarter-
over-quarter. 60% of our NPAs are current on payments and the past-due NPAs are centered on the SBA,
consumer, and residential portfolios. I'll reiterate that we do not see significant loss content in our portfolio.

D&I line utilization was up 1% in the quarter, and home equity line of credit utilization was down slightly. We
continue to have very strong capital ratios with a CE Tier 1 of 11.8% or 10.2% if AOCI were included in the
calculation. The move-down in interest rates caused our AOCI to shrink, helping our ending TCE to grow to 8.2%.
Our ending TBV per share grew to $46.32, up $6.23 for the year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 100,000 shares at a volume-weighted average price of $67.45. We
continue to believe risk-weighted asset growth and capital formation rate should be in a range that allows us to
continue to grow our regulatory capital ratios and provide us with great flexibility.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor with
KBW. Your line is open.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.

Good morning, Catherine.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I guess to start with your margin outlook, margin came right in line with your guidance for this quarter. I'm just
curious how you're thinking about the margin to this year, maybe – and how you're thinking about how rate cuts
impact your margin outlook? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Catherine, it's Steve. Thanks for asking the question. We have a page that we show every quarter, on page
11, it's the NIM trend. And as you mentioned, it went down from 3.50% to 3.48%, so 2 basis points, but within our
guidance between 3.45% and 3.50%. Our deposit cost increased 16 basis points, which was within our guidance
of 15 basis points to 20 basis points.
So as we think about 2024, it's interest-earning assets, it's rate forecast, and then our deposit beta assumptions.
So for interest-earning assets for the full-year 2024, we're sort of just reiterating the $41 billion, that's sort of what
we've thought about for the last several quarters. So we're thinking 2024, $41 billion, we'd start out, like the fourth
quarter was in the $40.4 million range, and so I wouldn't expect that to be much different coming out of the – out
of first quarter seasonality.

As it relates to the second assumption, which is the rate forecast, the Moody's consensus, which is what we use,
shows four rate cuts in 2024. They start in April. And then, we have four rate cuts in 2025. So, you would end the
year at 4.5% Fed funds in 2024. And our assumption, you would hit Fed funds rate at 3.50% by the end of 2025.
On our deposit beta, page 17, which is our cycle-to-date beta is 30%, and we would continue to expect deposit
costs to increase similarly in the fourth quarter before we get rate cuts sometime in the second quarter, it's how
we see [ph] it, so (12:49) deposit cost between 1.70%, 1.80% in the first quarter.
So I guess, based on all those assumptions, we would expect the full-year NIM to average somewhere between
3.45% and 3.55% for the full year in 2024, and we would sort of expect the first half to be in that 3.40% to 3.50%
range, and then exiting the back half in that 3.50% to 3.60% range. So that's kind of how we're thinking about
2024 with those assumptions.
As we think about 2025 and we think about another four rate cuts in 2025, we're thinking, as we model it,
somewhere in that 3.55% to 3.65% NIM range in 2025, depending on how we exit.
And then just kind of the last point I'll make is if we kind of play this out and the forward curve is sort of showing
that, at the end of 2025, we sort of have a 3% to 3.5% Fed funds rate and sort of a flatter upward-sloping curve,
2026 would look a lot like 2018, 2019 when our NIMs were in the 3.75%, yeah, maybe 3.90% range. So anyway,
as we kind of think about the short, medium, and long, that's sort of how we're thinking about it related to the
forecast.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I love it, I love it. Yeah, but this is really helpful. And it's just – it's interesting, it feels like you've just got upward
momentum in your margin. And I think – I'm curious to [ph] see (14:34) how you are thinking about how deposit
costs play into that. I mean, you've got such an opportunity to reprice assets on the way up. Even if we get rate
cuts, I feel like your loan yields are still going to be moving up, just given the way you're structured there. And so,
are there significant declines in deposit costs throughout all these assumptions or is it more kind of a stabilization
in deposit cost and then just – and really what's driving the higher margin is just upward momentum on the asset
side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. No, it's a good question. So maybe start with the asset side. I think we talked about it last quarter, but just
to reiterate, we – in 2024, we have well over $4 billion of fixed rate and adjustable rate repricings that are going to
happen in 2024. I think, in 2025, it's like $3.3 billion and 2026 with $3 billion. So, it's a healthy amount every year.
And so, yeah, those are somewhere in the 4.60% to 4.80% range for all three of those years, so they're kind of

fixed in there. As we think about – so that's going to be a tailwind assuming that the five-year treasury doesn't
move much lower than 3%, there'll be a spread over that.
If you think about the deposit rates, our money market accounts, you've seen a big increase in that over the last
12 months. Think if you looked in the earnings release, I think our money market accounts went up maybe $3
billion or so, and our CDs went up about $2 billion, and a lot of that was negotiated rates. And so in our total
portfolio of deposits, we have about a little over $10 billion of negotiated rates that we've given to our team to –
that they've managed to exception price.
On the flip side of that, we have about $10 billion of floating rate loans. About 30% of our loans is floating. So you
kind of look at both of those, and they sort of maybe not perfectly offset each other but help. CDs there's another
$4 billion that eventually will reprice to the front end of the curve over time. And then, the – we have securities
that'll reprice. So anyway, I guess the big tailwind, to your point, is really trying to manage the floating rate assets
versus the negotiated deposits and CDs, and then the fixed rate loans over time are sort of your help to margin. I
don't know if that's helpful, but [ph] sort of (17:13) how we think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. I'm kind of curious. You mentioned the DDA percentage, Will, would kind of back
down to the pre-pandemic level. Do we think this can kind of stabilize here at this level or you expect a little bit
more mix shift as we move on maybe prior to a potential rate cut?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Steve, it's hard to say. I think, a few quarters ago, we probably would have thought this would be where we end
up. It's – given that we've seen continued decline in that percentage, I don't think it's unreasonable to say it might
go down further from here, I don't know how much further. The pace of that change has mitigated quite a bit the
last few quarters. But it's hard to say that we're at the end necessarily, but it's really – it's hard to know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And to Will's point, I mean, it's sort of been a situation where it's gone down 1%, 1.2%. It's just – it's [ph]
where and when does the Fed pivot, and so it's (18:21) probably at that point is when all that changes, but that's a
[indiscernible] (18:27).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
For sure. Okay. And how should we think about kind of the provision and reserves moving forward? I mean,
obviously, you guys have talked about how much you've built relative to net charge-off. [ph] Think Will said
(18:41) you don't really see material or significant loss content in the book. So, it kind of felt like a big directional

reversal this quarter. Maybe what's kind of normalized net charge-offs for you as you think about your portfolio?
And do you think we could see this reserve start to trend down given no significant worsening in the core book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yes, yes, Steve. And I think – the way I think about it, our charge-offs last year were 8 basis points, and that's –
they've been very low for last several years. But I think it's reasonable to expect they normalize a bit from such a
low level, and to extent they do, that would impact provision expense. So we did, as we highlighted, build our
reserve the last couple years in advance of potential deterioration in the economy. But depending on our charge-
off levels from here, that could lead to provision expense to cover those charge-offs and depending on whatever
else the model tells us.
As far as normalized charge-offs, I don't have a good number to estimate. I mean, when you look back at peer
group, [ph] it'll certainly (19:50) be higher than what we've experienced. But I think it's hard to say for certain that
we could hang in there below 10 basis points every year in net charge-offs, but be great if we could.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Good. And then just last thing from me, maybe to John. This is maybe more your side of the coin here.
Wondering around M&A in this environment. Obviously, I know 2023 was a tough year, but you guys fared
phenomenally well. So a relatively advantaged currency rate presumably coming down, making the math a little
bit better. I'm just kind of wondering how you think about M&A this year and the potential for executing a deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Sure. As I've said previously, I mean, we're open for business. And to your point, I suspect that the math is
becoming easier with the lower interest rate marks. But, Stephen, really no change from our prior guidance. I
mean, our ideal partner, if we were to do something, would be in a 10% to a third of our pro-forma company.
We're in great markets in the southeast and we'd prefer to double down on our existing high-growth markets, but
the regulatory environment's a little tough for that right now. So, we've updated our population map on page 6.
And if we were to do a market extension type of deal, need to be in a similar high-growth market like Tennessee
or Texas.
But from a capital management standpoint, I think we're in a good spot with excess capital, and we've got
flexibility to use that capital. We can deploy it in share repurchases. We bought a little bit of shares back in the
fourth quarter. We could do a bond restructure or we could deploy it in M&A.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get some comments on slide 12,
which is the loan production chart. Obviously, it's come down since a very strong 2022. I know some of that is just
your kind of conservative nature, maybe not wanting to take on other people's credits as they move out of the
banks. But just given your footprint, just wanted to get some thoughts on loan growth expectations as we think
about the year, where are areas that you can maybe push the gas pedal a little bit, and I would assume that some
of the CRE portfolios or some areas where you'd be a little bit more cautious. But I think you'd previously kind of
talked about a mid-single-digit loan growth rate for next year, so just wanted to get some context there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's John. That graph is very interesting to me, on page 12, and we kind of had peak record
production in the second quarter of 2022. And if you think back, well, what happened in the second quarter of
2022? That's when the Fed started raising short-term interest rates. And precipitously after that, you've seen a
steady trend downward of production. So, the Fed is getting what it wants.
For 2023, we guided to mid-single-digit growth for the year, and we ended at 7% growth. So given the uncertainty
in the [ph] economies (23:10), I feel like that's a very appropriate level of growth with where we are in the cycle.
Pipelines for the end of the year are down considerably from where they were at the beginning of 2023, down
about 25%. But even though the pipelines are slowing down, Michael, there's kind of an embedded tailwind of
loan growth because with rates where they are, there's going to be slowing prepayments and there's continuing to
be funding of loans that are unfunded that we made in 2021, 2022.
So, our guidance really hadn't changed. We think mid-single-digit growth's reasonable and until rates decline. But
where do we see that growth? For us, we've seen a considerable amount of residential real estate growth in 2023,
and we're getting a nice coupon for that growth. And there's just more people moving into our markets than there
are homes available. So, I feel good about those credits from a asset quality standpoint.
CRE activity's been very low in 2023 with the recent rise in rates. You might see a little pickup there in 2024 with
the five-year treasury down as much as it is. And then, we've just got a continuous push on the C&I middle-market
space, so that's an area that we're leaning into. So, hope that's helpful, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very much so. And then maybe just one for Steve. I think the stepdown in correspondent this quarter was a little
bit greater than what some of us were kind of expecting. I know there's typically kind of a seasonal rebound in the
first quarter. Can you just kind of walk us through the dynamics there? And I think you had previously kind of
talked about a fee to average assets kind of in the 55 basis point to 65 basis point range. Any reason to think that
that might be different as we progress through the 2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Yeah, we – on page 31 is our fee income percentage, and you can
see that we're $65 million this quarter, 58 basis points of average assets. And of course, that was within our guide
of – we said at the low end of the 55 basis points to 65 basis points range in the fourth quarter, just of what we
saw. We're just kind of reiterating the same guidance for 2024. We would sort of expect a noninterest income to

average assets to be in the 55 basis points to 65 basis points for the full year. It's going to start on the lower end
of the range, like the fourth – like we had in the fourth quarter, for the first half of the year, and probably the upper
end of the range in the back half of the year.
And the reasoning for that is just sort of the yield curve normalizing, and sort of our interest rate sensitive
businesses like mortgage and correspondent, they just perform better when things are a little bit more normal
from that perspective. So as you kind of take that into 2025, we would expect our non-interest income to average
assets to return to that 60 to 70 basis points, which was approximately the 2022 level.
So, the way I kind of think about the variability in margin and our kind of our interest-sensitive businesses is we
need a little bit more yield curve normalization for those things to sort of get back to, I'll call it, more normal levels.
So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And like you mentioned, correspondent with the – and mortgage,
although mortgage was probably less volatile at this point, but correspondent, I don't think that probably – if you
think about the fixed income business, until they start cutting rates, that's probably not going to improve a lot our
interest rate swap business because of the lack of loan volume in the industry in the fourth quarter, probably in
the first quarter. It's probably not going to ramp to the sort of the back half of the year as rates stabilize.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's very helpful. And then, maybe if I can just squeeze one more in for John. Just reflecting on your comments
at the beginning of the call around technology cost, I think I was struck by how much the spend has increased in
three years' time or four years' time, up $68 million. As you think about going forward, just conceptually, any
larger technology products or re-hauls that you need to do or is it just more around the edges? Because that's a
pretty big lift in cost in a couple years. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, sure. I think our motto for 2023 was building a better bank and really was focused on the customer
experience, the employee experience and getting feedback from our team how to take friction out of the
technology. For 2024, it's kind of finish the drill is the theme, and it's really the technology and process
improvements that were already put in place the last couple years, we just want to complete those projects. So
there's really not, Michael, new significant technology platforms that we've got in the queue to update. So, I think
the bulk of our technology spending increases is in the rearview mirror. I mean, there's always going to be growth
in that category but nowhere near the level we've seen the last few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Michael, this is Steve. The only other comment I would make is, remember, when we did the MOE back four
years ago, that was one of the main reasons we did it. There was investment in technology that we needed to
make. And so, we used that period as an opportunity to take cost out of certain areas and reallocate it to the
technology. And so, that's sort of been the story of the last several years.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Hi, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. So, I appreciate the near-term guidance on expenses, but are you expecting expenses to kind of stay in that
similar range throughout the year or kind of growth rate are – you think is a good base case assumption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brandon, thanks for the – I'd say, for the full year, I think around that $1 billion number is about what we
would expect at this point. There are, of course, some – there's some components of compensation, et cetera,
that fluctuate with revenue volumes and some of the fee businesses in particular, that if that turns out differently
than we expect, those can move up or down. But for the full year, I think consensus said it's right around $1
billion, and that feels like a pretty good spot based on what we see today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And on fees with the CFPB overdraft proposal, are you considering any particular changes to your
overdraft policies? And I guess if not, what could be the potential impact if that does go into effect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Brandon, it's Steve. We made some changes maybe 15 to 18 months ago. We aren't contemplating any
new changes. I know there was a new paper that came out a few days ago, but as I understand it, the earliest that
would be approved is in October of 2025. So, I think it's probably just too early. And of course, we're thinking
about it, but we haven't run the math on any effect that would have on us, for sure. But anyway, that's kind of how
we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then lastly, on deposit pricing, I know CDs continue to be a headwind near term. But could you
potentially quantify or give some context around near-term CD repricing? And then, as you're looking and doing
the numbers, when could that potentially turn into a tailwind, maybe either in 2024 or 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Brandon, this is Steve. I think we have about $4 billion of CDs. I think 90% of that roughly come due in
2024. We have a fair amount coming due in the first quarter. I want to say it's not quite half, but it's a fair amount.
So as we think about repricing, we're just – CDs, by nature, or retail CDs are generally pretty short in nature, and
we retooled a couple of our retail products to continue to shorten those up. But the other [ph] day (31:51), CDs

only make up 12% of our total deposits. So, it'll be a little bit of a tailwind. I think the exception probably from
negotiated rates on the money markets is probably the place we put more liability sensitivity as we thought about
it.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samuel Varga with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I wanted to go back to the margin discussion just for a little bit. Just to clarify on the – obviously, I'm not digging
too far into the 2025 and 2026 guides, but just to clarify, you're assuming that the mid to longer end of the curve is
staying flattish [ph] at current (32:39) levels. So, there's a steepness to the curve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. If you look at the Moody's consensus forecast, I believe that today, the – all that five-year part, which is
where we put a lot of our assets, is somewhere in the 4% range. I want to say by the end of 2025, it's in that 3.5%
range, give or take, to sort of a flat curve by the time they cut [indiscernible] (33:00) rates and so on. So, that's
sort of our assumption for rates. We don't see – if the five-year part of the curve went up to 5%, of course, our
repricing would be stronger, but we might have other issues. And if the five-year goes down to 3% the next year,
then there's probably other rate issues. But anyway, that's how...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
If you were saying that for the end of 2025, Steve, so there is – at the end of 2024, is the Moody's consensus a
little higher than that, isn't it?

It's a little higher than – it's somewhere between 3.50% and 3.75%, I think, and then by the end of 2025, it's
around 3.5%. So, yeah. But as you know, at the end of October, I think when we had our earnings call, I think the
five-year treasury Moody's consensus was more like 4.5%. So, it does move around for sure. So, we'll find out for
sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then in terms of the down betas for 2024, what sort of assumptions do
you have there for deposit down betas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Let me take a bit of a longer-term view because there's always a lag in all of this. But from our experience
and from our modeling, as I think about our betas, I would say on the down betas, it's about 20% total. So for
instance, if I kind of run the math on, we're at 5.5% Fed funds rate, and over the next couple of years, they cut it
to 3.5% or 200 basis points. You would expect from our peak maybe 40 basis points of pressure to be relieved
coming back by 2026. And I know I'm not just talking about 2026, but it is a linear ramp and it takes time to do it,
but that would be really consistent if you kind of look back at our history. Look, it's a 20% beta, but there's always
a little bit of a lag in that first couple rate cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That makes sense. And then just a quick one, do you happen to have the spot interest-bearing deposit costs for
December year-end?

No, we don't. Not here in front of me unfortunately.

that through the cycle, and that would compare to the up beta of roughly 30%. Did I hear that right?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Excellent. Understood. Thank you. And then just lastly, as you guys kind of balance, you mentioned
the potential for a bond restructure versus buying back stock. Just kind of walk us through the thought process
there. And then, if you could confirm any potential bond restructure that would get done would be likely accretive
to that NIM guidance for 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Russell. It's Steve. We've talked about that on the call. I think it was last quarter we talked about it, and I
think it's the same kind of calculus. It's really just trying to think about our uses of capital. I think we talked up to
maybe a 10%, [ph] maybe not more ahead than (36:36) 15% of our portfolio restructure. And obviously, we'd be
thinking about it in terms of earn-back period less than three years. That's how we would think about it.
It's a lever. We're thinking about what we're, kind of just back to positioning the balance sheet, thinking about the
future. If rates come down, we are thinking about liability sensitivity a little bit, and we want to think about how to
position – if rates do fall, how to best position all the balance sheet. And of course, that takes time to do it. But

we've been thinking about it for the last couple of quarters. Certainly, we want to think about it for the next four or
five. So, that's from a perspective of the bond restructure. It's certainly something on the table. And to your point,
it's a lever. If they continue to have higher rates and our NIM has some pressure, that's a way that we can level
set it. But that's just on the restructure on the capital side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And as you noted, I mean, with the 11.8% CET 1, that does give us the luxury of considering more than
one option. And certainly, share repurchases are a use of capital that we think about as well. And where we sit
today based on our forecasted risk-weighted asset growth and capital formation rate, if we don't do any of those
things, you're going to see that CET 1 continue to climb from there. So, we like the flexibility we've got with our
capital position today and we'll continue to think about all those options we mentioned.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted to ask about kind of the earning asset mix for 2024. You talked about, I think, flattish earning assets from
the fourth quarter level of what looks like somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion of net loan growth. So from a
funding perspective of that loan growth, what are the cash flows [indiscernible] (38:46) securities portfolio for the
year and how lean would you run cash as you're thinking about kind of remixing the assets on the balance sheet a
little bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. I guess, it's really – I don't think it's changed a whole lot as you think about – if we have mid-single digit loan
growth, that's, I don't know, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, something like that. We have our securities portfolio that's
running off somewhere, depending on rates, $700 million to $800 million a year. So, that would imply that you
have about 2% to 3% deposit growth assumptions built in there. And we think it's slow in the front end. It probably
ramps in the back end. If you think about Q3 and all that stuff that they end up bringing that back, I would imagine

that liquidity in the system would get better in the back half. But – so just to make sure I was clear, our average –
our expected average for the year of earning assets is $41 billion. Our – it will start out a little lower than that, of
course, end up a little higher than that based on those assumptions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then just with the commentary in the press release with – of the reduction in brokered
deposits, can you tell us what the brokered balances are at year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's around $700 million, $720 million or so. We've really brought
that down over – during the March banking situation. We took it up $1.2 billion just to make sure that we had
plenty of liquidity, [ph] fortressed (40:29) balance sheet, and then of course, that's run off quite a bit over the year.
As I think about 2024, at least in the first half, I certainly think we'll replace those and potentially grow it a little bit.
But it'll be somewhere in that range. Historically, we run about 3% of average deposits. So, that'd be about S1
billion – somewhere in that $500 million to $1.5 billion range, I don't know, somewhere in there. That's typically
how we run it, depending on rates.
