Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening and I'm
joined once again by our CFO, Derek Meyer; and our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern. I'll start off by sharing some
highlights from the quarter. And then from there, Derek will provide a few updates on our margin, income
statement and capital trends and Pat will provide an update on credit.
At a macro level, the third quarter did bring a variety of data points indicating a slowing of the US economy. But
closer to home, we continue to see signs of resiliency and stability in our Midwestern footprint. Unemployment in
Wisconsin is at 2.9%, and many other Midwestern states are also below the national average. Our prime and
super prime consumer base has remained strong, and our commercial clients have largely been able to manage
their way through elevated rates, supply chain issues and inflation.
We serve stable markets and in tandem with our conservative approach to credit, that stability has translated to
strong asset quality trends again this quarter. Importantly, it has also enabled us to stay squarely focused on the
execution of our strategic plan. And now we're seeing several tailwinds start to emerge across our company. On
the consumer side, we now have a value proposition that stacks up well against just about anyone in the industry,
whether that's a commercial bank or a fintech.
Over the past few years, we've completely transformed the customer experience by building out a modernized
digital banking platform to make it easier for our customers to manage their money when and where they want.
We've deployed customer favorite product enhancements like Grace Zone, Early Pay, credit monitoring, and
we've launched a new Mass Affluent program to deepen relationships with the strategically important customer
segment. We're going to continue to make enhancements, but we already have what we need to grow in our
markets on the consumer side of the business and we are growing.
We believe we're right on track and importantly so do our customers. In 2024, we've seen the highest net
promoter and mobile banking satisfaction scores on record. We're also growing our customer base for the first
time in years and attracting a higher per household deposit balances with these new customers. On the
commercial side, we continue to build momentum by adding strong producers in key growth markets. Following
the addition of several experienced leaders such as Phil Trier, Neil Riegelman and Michael Lebens over the past
year, we're progressing on our overall plan to add 26 commercial and business RMs by early 2025.
Earlier this week, we announced the launch of a new specialty Deposit and Payment Solutions vertical focused on
deposit centric industries such as title and escrow, HOA property management and fintechs. This vertical will be
led by Rick Bruhn, an industry expert who joins us from U.S. Bank, where he spent the past 18 years of his
career. Our organic Phase 2 initiatives are already impacting our financial results.
Here in the third quarter, we saw encouraging signs of progress with over $600 million in core customer growth,
core customer deposit growth and nearly $300 million in C&I loan growth and solid core earnings growth. We
have positioned ourselves to outperform in both an improving macroeconomic scenario or in a low growth market
condition.
With that said, I'd like to walk through some of the additional financial highlights from the third quarter beginning
on slide 2. On a GAAP basis, we posted diluted EPS of $0.56 per share. Core customer deposits grew by over
2% from the prior quarter, but they also grew by 2% relative to the same period last year, demonstrating the
incremental impact of our initiatives above and beyond the seasonal inflows we typically see this time of year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
This core deposit growth has also enabled us to work down our wholesale funding balances by 2% during the
quarter.
On the other side of the balance sheet, we've continued to make progress on our efforts to enhance our
profitability profile by diversifying our loan portfolio. Total loans grew by over 1%, led by emerging C&I growth and
steady production in our auto book.
Shifting to the income statement, our balance sheet growth combined with an expansion of asset yields and a
slight decrease in liability costs, drove a 3 basis point increase in our net interest margin and a $6 million increase
in NII during the quarter. Our revenues were also boosted by a $2 million increase in noninterest income, led by
continued growth in wealth management fees.
Total noninterest expense increased to $201 million for the quarter, but our efficiency ratio decreased slightly as
we continue to diligently manage our expense level while executing on our growth strategy throughout the year.
On the capital front, the stability and expansion of our core profitability profile has enabled us to accrete capital
throughout the year. Here in Q3, our CET1 finished at 9.72%, a 33 basis point increase from the end of 2023.
Underpinning our entire strategy is our foundational discipline on managing credit risk, and we again saw solid
results in Q3.
During the quarter, our nonaccruals and net charge offs decreased meaningfully. We added another $21 million in
provision and increased our ACLL by a 1 basis point. As always, we remain committed to staying ahead of the
curve by taking a disciplined, consistent approach to loan risk ratings, so we can better understand credit risk in
our portfolio by both segment and geography. We will continue to monitor asset quality closely.
Shifting to slide 3. We've talked at length about the foundational outcomes from Phase 1 of our strategic plan. And
here in 2024, we've worked hard to build on the momentum by steadily executing our Phase 2 initiatives. As we
sit here in October, much of the consumer product work has already been completed. Specifically, we've
continued to roll out quarterly product and service updates that enhance the consumer customer experience and
position us to attract, deepen and retain customer relationships. You can see that in the front line where we've
addressed pain points that improve the branch and client experience and you can see it in the product set we've
added tools to make it easier for customers to manage their money regardless of where they are.
We still plan to make regular enhancements going forward, but the fact is we now have a value proposition that
enables us to compete with just about anyone in the marketplace, whether that'd be the community banks down
the street, the large banks in the urban centers or even fintechs. We also remain on track for growth on the
commercial side of the company, where we've continued to make progress in our plans to hire 26 commercial and
business RMs to support and amplify our growth strategy.
Today, we've added a net of 16 RMs since September 30th of last year, and we expect to hit our target of 26 by
early next year. The impact of our hires thus far is beginning to emerge in our financial results and we expect this
impact to grow throughout 2025 as the new our RMs across our footprint settle in and build their respective
pipelines.
Taken together, we remain on track with Phase 2 and we continue to expect cumulative incremental commercial
loan growth of $750 million, cumulative incremental deposit balances of $2.5 billion, and annual household growth
of 3% by the end of 2025.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
We added slide 4 to give a more visual snapshot of where we've been, where we are, and where we're going as a
company. These are the three metrics that drive our story. First, our customers are more satisfied. After being
named number one for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power back in April we're now seeing the highest net
promoter and mobile banking satisfaction scores we've ever seen on record at Associated Bank. Secondly, we've
taken a years-long negative household trend and flipped it to positive in 2024. This sets us up to deepen
relationships and drive deposit growth over time. And finally, we're continuing to add top talent to our commercial
team. As we've said in the past, this sets us up to drive loan growth, but it also positions us to deepen full banking
relationships with deposits and other services like TM. We feel good about our trajectory and look forward to
sharing more specifics around our 2025 outlook in January.
With that, I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the third quarter, beginning on slide 5 with the loan
portfolio. Total period end loans grew by $373 million during the quarter. And this growth was once again led by
our C&I and auto verticals. We look to continue remixing our balance sheet while retaining our conservative
approach to credit. As a partial offset to this growth, we saw CRE construction loans decreased by $141 million
during the quarter as an elevated payoff trend extended into Q3. We also saw our resi mortgage book decreased
slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to diversify the consumer side of our loan portfolio.
Across our broader portfolio, we've continued to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships,
quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we continue to expect total
loan growth to land at the lower end of our original range of 4% to 6% in 2024.
Moving to slide 6, we mentioned back in July we expect the deposit growth to ramp up in the second half of 2024
and here in Q3, that trend has played out just as expected. During the quarter, we added over $600 million of core
customer deposits, a 2% increase relative to Q2. While the primary driver of this growth was customer CDs, we
kept it short, funneling the vast majority of that production through our seven months CD. And importantly, most of
our CD holders are already customers. 77% of active CD holders had a checking account with us in September.
This percentage has risen significantly from prior years, thanks to our relationship deepening initiatives such as
Mass Affluent.
Those relationship deepening efforts are also visible through growth in other deposit categories such as DDA and
interest bearing checking during the quarter. The inflow of core customer deposits during the quarter enabled us
to work down our wholesale funding by 2%, with the primary driver being a decreased – decrease in FHLB
advance. We continue to expect core customer deposit growth to finish 2024 at the lower end of our original 3%
to 5% growth range. And we remain confident in our ability to attract and deepen quality customer deposit
relationships over time.
With that, I'll pass it to Derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. I'll start by discussing our asset liability yield trends on slide 7. Despite the 50 basis point rate cut
at the tail end of the quarter, we saw asset yields inch higher in all major loan categories, including CRE, C&I,
auto and resi here in Q3. Largely driven by these trends, our overall earning asset yield increased by 3 basis
points during the quarter to 5.68%. On the liability side, interest bearing deposit costs ticked up by 3 basis points
but growth in deposits enabled us to decrease the reliance on higher cost wholesale funding during the quarter.
As such, our total cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to 3.59%.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Moving to slide 8, the trends I just described netted out to a 3 basis point expansion in our quarterly net interest
margin, landing us at 2.78% for the quarter. Our NII came in at $263 million for the quarter, representing a $6
million increase from prior quarter and an $8 million increase from the same period a year ago. Based on our
latest expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and fed action, we now expect to drive net interest
income growth of between 0% and 1% in 2024.
On slide 9, we provided some additional color on the proactive steps we've taken to dampen our asset sensitivity
and prepare for a falling rate environment. This process started in late 2021, when we began adding fixed rate
prime and super prime auto loans to our books. As of September 30, the portfolio has grown to $2.7 billion.
While we've been clear all along that we don't intend to become known as the auto bank, these balances come at
an attractive yield with less prepayment risk or extension risk than mortgages. In addition, we began layering in a
portfolio of receive fixed swaps to our books in 2022 to protect against downside rate risk.
As of the September 30, we maintained a notional balances of approximately $2.85 billion. And finally, we've been
thoughtful about our funding mix, emphasizing shorter term durations for contractual funding sources such as
CDs and wholesale funding. As of Q3, we had over $10 billion in obligations set to mature in one year or less,
which is about 87% of the total. Taken together, these actions have put our balance sheet in a much more neutral
position with a down 100 ramp scenario representing about a 1% impact to our NII as of Q3, which is reduced
from the 3.4% impact we were modeling in Q4 of 2022. Our goal is to maintain this modestly asset sensitive
position going forward.
Shifting to slide 10, we continue to manage our securities book within our 18% to 20% target range with the
benefit of rising rates combined with the securities repositioning we completed late last year, the average yield on
our securities book is 50 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. On a dollar basis, both our cash
and investment securities positions increased slightly as compared to Q2. And these combined positions now
represent 22% of total assets. Over the remainder of 2024, we continue to target investments to total assets of
between 18% to 20%.
On slide 11, we provide an update on noninterest income through Q3. Total noninterest income came in at $67
million during the quarter, which represents a 3% increase from Q2. On a year-to-date basis, noninterest income
continues to track roughly $3 million higher than in 2023. Here in the third quarter, growth trends were primarily
driven by wealth management fees, which were up $2 million compared to Q2 and service charges, which were
up $1 million over the same period. This growth was partially offset by smaller decreases in [indiscernible]
(00:27:05) mortgage banking and capital markets. We continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our
noninterest income in a challenged environment and as such, we continue to expect full year noninterest income
to finish in the range of negative 1% to 1% growth as compared to our adjusted 2023 base of $264 million.
Moving to slide 12, we continue to make ongoing investments to support our growth initiatives. But maintaining
our thoughtful, disciplined approach to where we invest those dollars continues to be a foundational focus. In the
third quarter, total noninterest expense of $201 million was up $5 million compared to the prior quarter, driven
primarily by increases in legal, professional and FDIC assessment costs. Despite the dollar uptick in expenses,
our adjusted efficiency ratio actually decreased during the quarter to 60.4%, and our noninterest expense to
average assets ratio has remained in line with prior quarters at 1.93%. These metrics are a reflection of our
commitment to keeping expenses in check while investing in our organic growth strategy.
With this in mind, we lowered our full year expense outlook. We now expect total noninterest expense growth of
between 1% and 2% in 2024 off of our adjusted 2023 base of $783 million. As a reminder, this outlook excludes

the $31 million FDIC special assessment expense booked in 2023 and an additional $4 million of net FDIC
special assessment expense booked in the first three quarters of 2024.
On slide 13, we once again saw key capital ratios increased across the board here in Q3. We saw a 32 basis
point net increase in our TCE ratio during the quarter, finishing at 7.50%. This net increase was driven by AOCI
recovery and improved profitability, partially offset by asset growth in the [ph] denominator (00:28:56). AOCI
recovery represented about 27 basis points of benefit. After falling to 9.39% as a result of our balance sheet
repositioning in Q4 of last year, our CET1 ratio has steadily climbed throughout 2024 and currently sits at 9.72%
as of Q3. This is now the highest CET1 ratio we've posted since Q1 of 2022. TCE and CET1 both remain well
within our 2024 target ranges as of Q3. Given current market conditions, we continue to expect TCE to remain in
the range of 6.75% to 7.75% in 2024. We also expect CET1 to remain in a range of 9% to 10% over the same
timeframe.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.

Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start our credit portion with an allowance update on slide 14. We utilized the Moody's
August 2024 baseline forecast for CECL forward looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains
consistent for the resilient economy, despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline forecast contains no
additional rate hikes, slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of
inflation.
Our ACLL increased by another $8 million in Q3 to finish the quarter at $398 million, with an increase in CRE,
partially offset by a decrease in commercial and business lending. The uptick in CRE largely stemmed from some
migration into criticized loans during Q3. We do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant shift in
credit stress, but rather it is a reflection of our adherence to risk rating definition guidance, acknowledging shifts in
credit profiles. The bank does not view these credits representing risk of loss at this time as reflected in our stable
ACLL. Altogether, our reserves to loan ratio increased by 1 basis point from the prior quarter and 7 basis points
from the same period a year ago to 1.33%.
Moving to slide 15, we maintain a high degree of confidence in the quality of our loan portfolio with continued solid
performance in core credit quality trends. Credit metric changes are reflective of the continued theme of
normalization within the portfolio. At the front of the pipeline total bank wide delinquencies landed at $56 million
during the third quarter.
After a downtick last quarter, Q3 is in line with recent trends and historical averages. Further down the line, total
criticized and classified loans increased from the prior quarter. As noted earlier, the majority of this increase was
driven by a migration within CRE loans. Again, we do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant
shift in the credit profile of the portfolio, but rather it is a reflection of our adherence to risk rating definition
guidance, which acknowledges shifts in specific credits but does not represent risk of loss at this time.
We continue our ongoing portfolio deep dives and don't see a systemic shift in the CRE portfolio. In fact, we see
near-term resolution in many of the noted downgrades. Within the nonaccrual bucket specifically, we saw
balances decrease for the second consecutive quarter to $128 million. We continue to see a steady pace of
resolution within these stressed credits. Finally, we booked $13 million in net charge offs during the quarter and
$21 million in provision, both of which represented the lowest numbers we've seen in the past several quarters.

Our net charge off ratio decreased by 11 basis points to 0.18%. Taken together, our credit metrics continue to
give us confidence that what we've seen to-date is a handful of credits migrating through the rating system and
not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters. Overall, outside of these
specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity we've seen across the bank.
Going forward, we remain diligent and monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to ensure current
underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures and labor cost to name just a few economic concerns. In
addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effect of elevated interest rates on the portfolio,
including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis, bank wide. We expect any future provision adjustments will
continue to reflect changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes and other indications of credit quality.
Finally, we've provided a refresh of key CRE metrics in slide 16. In building our CRE portfolio, we focused on
partnering with well-known developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable Midwest markets. Two thirds of
our CRE portfolio is based in the Midwest, with an emphasis on multi-family and industrial properties. We do not
have any exposure to rent controlled New York City real estate market.
Office loans now represent just 3.1% of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio, we are weighted
towards Class A properties in non-urban environments. We continue to take a proactive approach to CRE office
credits with the majority of those maturing for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 already having strategies in
place whether that'd be refinance, sale or qualifying for extensions and prevailing underwriting standards. While
we feel well-positioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in, we will continue to
monitor this and all of our portfolios closely.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Thanks, Pat. I'll wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 17. Starting with the
balance sheet, we've continued to seek selective loan growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality
credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we continue to expect total loan
growth to land at the lower end of our original range of 4% to 6% in 2024.
We're pleased with the work that's been done across the bank to attract, deepen and retain customer
relationships and with the resulting momentum we've seen in foundational areas such as customer satisfaction
and household growth, remain confident in our ability to deliver core customer deposit growth. And we continue to
expect our core customer deposit growth to finish 2024 at the lower end of our original 3% to 5% growth range.
On the income statement, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and
rate environment. Taking these factors into account, we now expect net interest income growth of between 0%
and 1% for 2024. We continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged
environment and continue to expect noninterest income growth of negative 1% to positive 1% in 2024 relative to
our adjusted 2023 base. And finally, our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our
company.
With this in mind, we've lowered our noninterest expense outlook to growth of 1% to 2% in 2024, after excluding
the impact of FDIC special assessment. With that, let's open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question is from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe first, just on the margin, as we think about how we might go
forward, just – you have a table on slide 9 that that shows the funding maturities. Just curious kind of some of the
rate pickup opportunities, you think on a – especially on the one year funding opportunities that you show there,
what that might look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So I'll say a couple of things, I am getting a little feedback. Page 9 we put out there on purpose. I mean, we
wanted to show our contractual funding obligations really have been contained to one year or less. And I think
that jumps out pretty clearly. When you think about the one year out, we feel like we have a lot of ability to work
with the rate increase that is slow and steady. I would say where anybody would get in trouble is or be pressured
more on margin would be if you see a big jump quickly and then you see an inverted rate curve.
We're not believing that those two things will happen. And so with the fact that we've been [ph] able to remain
short and then (00:38:26) on the CD side, it doesn't even pull up the fact that we have $3.6 billion in customer
CDs that are essentially seven months in duration. When those are renewing, we're getting 90% plus retention on
those and we're picking up 100 basis points plus so far. So we feel like we can manage the downward interest
rate risk. There are a lot of factors that come into that during the year. We haven't given guidance for next year,
but we've set ourselves up in a way to be ready for that. And I would say the other thing that Derek's done a very
nice job for us is making us less asset sensitive, which is also on page 9.
You can see back when I had gotten here, we were very asset sensitive and we kind of wrote that up. And then
steadily over a couple of years, Derek and his team managed that down purposefully, where now we think we're
very much in line with the industry and with an even playing field. It comes down to execution of strategies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And then maybe one on the lender hirings where you – you provided an update as to where you stand now. It
looks like there's – it looks like a pretty good jump here in the next quarter or two with the kind of final leg of those
hirings. But curious where you stand in terms of – where you think you stand in terms of kind of fully baked in
opportunities from those lenders for – from a lending perspective and where that that might end up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So we gave – we put at the beginning what our forecast for increased performance would be. Maybe I
could share some stats that we haven't explicitly called out, but when we look up, we're about 17% up in RMs
over the past year. What's interesting is we track pipelines greater than 50% probability to close and pipelines
above 50%. Now above 50%, some people might say that's wishful thinking – below that. If you have above 50%
9


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
certainty, you're pretty likely going to close those deals. That pipeline from a year ago is up 18%. So we already
see the early – it's great to hire people. We don't make money by hiring people. We make money by having them
get out there, get a full relationship and book it.
So right now, the category that has the probability of closing above 50% is growing at a rate very similar to what
we're seeing in the hiring front. So that's pretty impactful to us. We also hired people have not solicitations, those
expired. We had one expire in October. We have one expire in November. Our ability to attract top talent and [ph]
I'm just (00:41:16) confident right now as I have been since I joined this company 3.5 years ago. So I feel quite
confident we're going to be able to bring in talent over the next three to four months and get the entire team net –
the net team at a position where we are up 26 RMs.
It takes about six months for somebody typically to really hit their stride. So, we – and I expect the impact from the
folks we've already hired throughout the year. We're sticking with what we believe we can get an upside because
these folks are talented and they're bringing their pipelines up at a rate that is as quite good. So, it's a long
answer to a short question. But now we've gone to the second phase, which is we've gone from hiring people to
seeing a pipeline that has certainty, in this past quarter, we saw a little bit of growth. We expect that that will
continue on even a modest growth marketplace through 2025.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Andy, I was hoping you might be able to kind of
discuss the outlook for the complexion of loan growth in the fourth quarter. I think you [ph] really (00:42:43)
touched on it or a portion of it with the comments about onboarding personnel from earlier this year. But it looks
like I mean need to be just a touch stronger than you generated in the third quarter. So just curious where that will
come from and maybe more broadly, if you can spend a moment on sort of what your customers are saying about
appetite to borrow, what might get them off the sidelines, et cetera.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, well, you asked a lot in that one question, [indiscernible] (00:43:07). And so what I would say is every
quarter that goes by, if you think about a ramp up of six months, we got another quarter for the folks that are here
in the commercial team. So that piece of it gives me quite a bit of confidence. We've been able to bring auto loans
in at a really nice yield and when we're bringing people in last month, I believe, Derek, the FICO was [ph] 7.96%
(00:43:33).

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I mean, Derek and I are concerned that we won't be able to get financed. So we're really pleased with the quality
of that customer. But we're also steadily growing that portfolio going into the rest of the year. We won't accelerate
that. But those have been the key drivers. For us on the commercial real estate side, it's healthy to get payoffs
when people have completed some of their construction projects. So we're down in that category. I actually see
that as a good thing for the bank and for the borrower.
However, that longer term rate stayed a little bit high. So, we may not – we may not see the payoffs in the fourth
quarter that we did in the third quarter. That's uncertain. But it looks like if those stay a little high and we get the
yield curve we are seeing now, that that could also lead to a fewer payoffs. And then finally, when you have a
situation where you bring in a lot of new people, you do have some people exit. And so we look closely at the
portfolio and say with the exits, what credits are we willing to exit? And so we had a few credits that we thought
were okay if they exited in the second and third quarter. We feel pretty clean right now.
And so we don't think that we would have the payoff volume that we had in the prior two quarters either. So you
marry a seasoned commercial group with a steady auto book and a decrease in payoffs. And that's where we
think we'll – we've stayed pretty steady in the range that we have, but now we've gone to the lower end of it on
loans.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe, Pat, can you – would you mind spending just a second kind
of expanding on your comments regarding the increase in criticized loans? It feels kind of like – because there
was just a risk rating shift in there, would that be sort of a one-time step up or does that take a couple of quarters
to work its way through? How do the sort of pushes and pulls in their work?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, as I noted, I think – we've circled a handful of those credits that we think are kind of short-term, they could
see upgrades in the next quarter or two. So we're not overly concerned that there's going to be some continued
migration there. These are kind of – a lot of the things, these are not portfolio wide. These are more select credits
and it's kind of normal course of business stuff that we're seeing. And I'll point out that in the CRE book, we
continue to focus on long-term customer relationships and these are sponsors we've worked with for many years.
We remain very confident in how those relationships are stepping up and working with us to address some of
these issues. And like I said, they're more kind of normal course of business stuff and nothing systematic or a big
shift within the portfolio.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jared Shaw with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good evening. Thanks. Maybe just going back to the auto side, the auto growth has been a little lower than I
think what you had indicated earlier in the year. But you call out good yields and great credit metrics there. What's
causing you to keep that growth rate a little lower than maybe you would that [ph] 200 to 250 (00:47:00) range
earlier? Is it just trying to build that capital ratio or what's sort of the dynamic from keeping you from seeing better
growth there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, it's not – thanks for the question, Jared. It's not the capital ratio. This is a category [ph] where (00:47:16)
we've said we want to be prime and super prime and we want it to fit into the rest of our book. And we don't want
to be aggressive. We've said we don't want to be the auto bank per se and we want to make sure that we're
keeping our outstandings in a range for us as we've seen a little bit slower growth, we don't want it to outpace the
rest of the portfolio.
However, the deals that we're putting on with the [ph] 7.96% (00:47:41) FICO and a very nice yield is very good
business. We don't want to dip down in FICO. We don't want to dip down in credit risk on a balance scorecard, we
won't. And so when demand has gone down a little bit, we could expand our network of dealers we haven't
aggressively done that to make up for it. We like the pace that we're running at. We like the dealers that we're
dealing with. We like the steady growth in the business.
And frankly, we want our commercial business to ramp up. And that is – that's the area of focus for us right now,
where we've – where we're trying to get a pivot in the overall portfolio. So as we've seen some softening in the
auto sales overall, we haven't felt that we need to press on that to put something put additional volume on the
books.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks for that color. And then on the securities portfolio, I mean, Derek, what's the expectation
on cash flow over the next year coming from securities? And can you just sort of remind us of what the roll off
yield and roll on yield is looking like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So we have about $400 million a quarter that rolls off. We're probably putting on $500 million. The
differential in what's rolling off and what's [ph] going back on (00:49:03) is not as large as it was, but it's still
probably 25 basis points to 50 basis points. We have a good portion of that still in our held to maturity that's more
muni and those [ph] not rolling off (00:49:14), they're more long-term investments. So we – but we still think for
the next five or six quarters you're going to get 3 basis points or 4 basis points a quarter pickup in the total book.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just finally for me, I guess, yeah, looking at expenses and maybe looking out
into to 2025, not guidance for 2025, but just sort of the outlook with you pulling back the expense growth going
into the end of the year, but still bringing on these new hires, how should we think about the trajectory maybe of
longer term investment in the business and this positive operating leverage, something we should be thinking is
attainable as you – as we go out over the next year or so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Let me take that one. So you said a few things in there. And I will say we don't share guidance for 2025 until
January, but a few things with regards to positive operating leverage, because you started with expenses, but of
course it's expense and revenue and the revenue part of it is really impacted by rate. And so when we think about
the first piece of that, we think we set ourselves up by staying short on deposits.
What we do know going into next year, and I'm particularly happy with, is that we have momentum in categories
that we need momentum in in order to drive revenue, and that is customer growth, that is deposit growth, that's
sustainable. And when you have customer growth with really high satisfaction, that lead to sustainable deposit
growth. So I feel really good about that heading into next year.
We have a commercial book on the deposit side that we right sized a couple of businesses. We're done right
sizing that. So as we head into 2025, my expectation is to market outperform versus our peers going into that.
And then look, we have spent a lot of energy getting really good leaders on the commercial side and good people
attract good people and we mix that with a team that was really pretty solid that we already had at the bank with
the new folks we're adding that are quality. I don't see anyone that has that combination of customer satisfaction,
customer growth, leading to deposit growth on consumer and then investment in additional 26 RMs on a base of
90.
And so I find those to be good lead indicators that we're set up to outperform. Now to get to positive operating
leverage, we have to understand what happens in the rate cut scenario. And there's no one on this call that knows
that. We know that the rates are likely to be cut. We don't know at what pace, at what time, and we don't know
what the yield curve will do on that. And I'd say that those – the impact of those, they're not just generic loan and
deposit impacts, they could impact stuff like the amortization of resi loans that are at lower rate, which we would
love to see. So we're going to get a feel for that.
We think as we go through this final quarter and we'll be set up in a better position to answer that positive
operating leverage question. But Jared, you know that's on my mind. Obviously, I could rattle off a lot of things
that go into that, but that's what our team is discussing, what we think the impact of rate, that's probably the
biggest unknown because we're tracking every other key indicator going into it. So we think we're relatively well
set up from a revenue and expense standpoint. And I will tell you, we've already – as we have in every single
year, we've actually just wrapped up our expense management tactics going into 2025. So we're ready on that
piece down to the line of business at this point.

Jon, [indiscernible] (00:53:15).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, one follow-up on Jared's question, Derek, on the securities portfolio size, should we expect modest growth
like we've seen in the last few quarters? Is that the right way to think about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
That's right. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Noninterest bearing deposits we talked about that a little bit last quarter. I expect them to be a little bit higher, but
maybe just help us understand what's going on there and what kind of an outlook you have. Is that maybe
troughed?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think well, we saw a little bit of growth this quarter. It's – [ph] it works (00:53:52). We're closing in on
probably the level that we thought we'd finish the year. Maybe it's $100 million to $200 million less than we
thought four quarters ago. But it's – it grew this quarter and we think it's stabilized on the nominal dollar amount.
We think the rest of the book is going to continue to grow faster going into next year. So as I think I've said before,
I think as a percent the industry is going to see a smaller percent of noninterest bearing, but I don't see it as a risk
to earnings like it was at the end of the year and last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And I would say comparatively, if you think about a bank that's growing at 0% on their customer base, checking
household customer base for one that's growing at 2% to 3%, which is what we expect. And by the way, we
haven't been able to enjoy that kind of growth in the past. We went from minus 1.5% to 0% to 1% – we expect
14


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
1.5% this year and we're forecasting [ph] 3% (00:54:45) next year. So that plays a positive role when you think
about noninterest bearing accounts and balances.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then just on the net interest income guide, the 0% to 1%, when you kind of play around
with the numbers, it feels like net interest income is troughing. I know the margin is a little bit tougher, but is it safe
to say that net interest income is likely at a bottom at this point based on what you're seeing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think – we think as we look at this year and start to think about scenarios for next year, that second
quarter was our trough.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. One more, if I can, Pat. I understand you answered the question earlier on criticized, but any thoughts on
the provision from here? Is this just something that's going to match loan growth and charge offs or is there
something telling you, you guys need to continue to slowly build reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
I think we're pretty solid with where our reserves are right now. And I think, we'll continue to watch any
movements. But I think loan growth is obviously a factor. So we'll look at that. But we feel pretty good about the
reserves right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe if we could start, how is your deposit pricing strategy
on non-CD products? How has that changed following last month's fed announcement and more rates to come?
And I ask because I do think of Associated is to be more of an offensive bank playing offense. And then how do

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So the – so I think what's been pleasing and it might be because of softer loan growth during the quarter.
We as an industry, we've seen at least initially, everybody drop rates pretty aggressively. So that allowed us to do
that. We took our rate specials down to – from 4.5% to 4%, and I think we're already moving those down in the
next week again. And that seems to be similar to what I see other banks doing. So that's been a positive.
Normally you see deposits lag quite a bit in the first quarter after rates start dropping. Again I see the industry
moving pretty quick, which gives us room from that standpoint. If we think about going into next year, we think that
the [indiscernible] (00:57:30) are the same that we've shared before, which would be 51% to 56% on interest
bearing, probably 45%, 46% on total deposits. I think that's looking at this – before this first rate cut all the way
through next December.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Perfect. And then a follow up for Patty. How much should we read into the increase in the construction CRE
reserve is up to 3.74%? And was that connected at all to the migration into substandard loans that we've talked
about a couple of times?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, in part it was due to that migration. And then as always, we're always looking at the CRE office book to
make sure we're – that's still playing out in many markets. So we want to make sure we've got enough cushion
there just, for the future. But it's a combination of both.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then maybe one quick on that. The $24 million of wealth management fees, is that a good run rate?
The market's been strong or are there any one-time estate fees or something like that that can show up in any
given quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, now look, I'm really pleased with our wealth business. We're just starting to hit the tip of the iceberg with
that, the market's been good. That's been a driver of it. However, we're seeing referrals into that at a rate that
we've not seen before. And so when you start to grow your customer base, when you create a mass affluent
strategy that logically upstreams into private wealth, that's starting to happen. In addition to that, when you add 16
commercial RMs in that and then you get to 26, those all have business owners. And the partnership there has
been spectacular. And so, they're starting to referring to there. We've had good financial performance there,
frankly, in the future, we've had investments in our consumer bank with step one. We've had investments in our
commercial bank. That was step two. We're going to meet at wealth here at some point in the future. And – but in
the meantime, we're seeing a really nice trend going into that business.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Starting with some of the changes on the funding side, with the incremental time deposits
coming on and the mix shift within the wholesale base, can you give us some sort of proxy as to where funding
costs were at September 30 to help us kind of formulate the starting points of 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, so there's just a lot of movement and – there's just a lot of movement on the liability side. I thought, well,
maybe we can get a little bit more detail as to what that did to the pricing dynamic, maybe even just within the
deposit base. I guess, where were the CDs [ph] brought (01:00:53) on? Was that at a rate below the 3Q rate or
how does the number of [indiscernible] (01:01:01) on in 3Q [indiscernible] (01:01:04)?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Yeah. I mean you saw that we changed pricing all throughout the quarter. So you had us – or most of our CD
rates were at – our specials were at 5%. We took them up above that for a few weeks at the end and then we
took them right down to another at 4.50% and we're taking them to 4% on November 1. So it's been very dynamic
from that standpoint. And then you had about half the CD book in the brokered market and all those we had four
handles on it in terms of production. So when you see our quarter-over-quarter CD book, it was flat. We grew it,
but the rate was exactly the same the two quarters put together.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
You'll see that on page 7 of the tables we set out, and that was at 4.83% for both quarters on an [ph] AEV
(01:01:57) basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess just, looking at the NII guide, that imply a step up in the fourth quarter.
And I get that asset sensitivity has been reduced kind of when you extend out over the next 12 months. But I'm
just wondering where the confidence is and NII being able to grow in 4Q given maybe some of the near-term
asset sensitivity pressures and the lag that might come on the liability side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think our biggest confidence in NII growth and the fact that we think this second quarter this year was the
trough is driven by the – our strategies and that what I mean by that is the loan growth and the deposit growth
both in improved profitability products, so C&I loans versus resi run off core customer deposits versus the
wholesale funding. And then the overall growth of the balance sheet is what gives us that confidence. I think if we
weren't taking market share and didn't have a plan to take market share vis-à-vis our C&I strategy, it would be
harder for us to say that because you just wouldn't have enough balance sheet growth to support the NII outlook
we're talking about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then maybe another way of asking my first question, just any thoughts around interest bearing beta as
it sits in 4Q and then what the expectation is for beta on the way down and kind of magnitude and timeline?

Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, we don't – I don't have a quarterly beta for you. I think the best guidance would be what – already answered
the question before looking out between – before the first rate cut, which would have been August and where we
expect our beta to finish in December of next year. I can add that that would have assumed 75 basis points of
cuts yet this year, 100 basis points cuts of next year and you get to a full deposit beta of 46%.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks for the question. Derek, the loan betas, I guess, can you just help us on loan betas, your assumptions on
the down beta for the assets there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So I guess I think the easiest thing because that's going to depend a lot on mix is to – is we do disclose it's
in the Q and I think – I don't think it's changed much since the last one. You'll see it in the new one. Our loan book
either reprices or mature, 66% of that either reprices or matures within a year. If you take our – we have a $2.85
billion of swaps, about $1.07 billion of that is against the loans that would take that 66% that reprices in a year,
down to about 60%. So that offers you some opportunity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And then if you think of the securities book on of that in terms of earning assets, you expect those yields. And I
think like I mentioned early in the call to trickle up throughout the year. So that can take your overall asset beta
below the deposit beta or total liability beta, I talked about. You are right, the challenge is going to be is that just
how things end next year. And we think that that gives us the opportunity to expand margin higher at the end of
next year than this year. But the path there will largely depend on the aggressiveness in the industry for deposit
pricing and that's why I think a little bit slower growth is probably better for us from a deposit standpoint because
we don't think people be as competitive on deposits. We still have the advantage of generating our own loan
growth because we have the market share strategy by hiring the more C&I relationship managers.

Almost all of it's fixed. There's a little bit – in terms of the securities, there's a little bit of FHLBs in there
sometimes, but that's – so I treat that as largely all fixed. And then seasonality for us on deposits tends to be
strong. If you look at the back half of last year, we were strong. Also, I expect that to repeat itself, particularly with
the additional initiatives in place.
