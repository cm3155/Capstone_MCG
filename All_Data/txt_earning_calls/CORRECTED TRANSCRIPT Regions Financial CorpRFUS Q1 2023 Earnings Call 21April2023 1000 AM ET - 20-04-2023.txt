Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' first quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level
commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer
and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover
our presentation materials prepared comments and Q&A.
I will now turn the call over to John.

John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions
delivered another solid quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term
performance. We generated earnings of $588 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62.
Despite recent events in the banking industry, we remain focused on the fundamentals and things we can control.
We've spent over a decade enhancing our interest rate risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity management
frameworks. Our relationship based banking approach, coupled with our favorable geographic footprint, uniquely
positions us to weather an uncertain market backdrop.
Further, balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet have been a key focus for years. As a result, we
are well-positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Approximately 70% of our deposits are retail
deposits. These deposits tend to be granular and less rate sensitive. In fact, approximately 90% of these deposits
are insured.
Our strategy focuses on primacy and customer loyalty. We want to be in our customer's primary banking
relationship. This strategy is evident in the fact that over 90% of our consumer checking households include a
high-quality checking account, and over 60% of consumer checking deposit balances are with customers that
have been with Regions for 10 years or more.
Our wholesale or business services deposits are also highly diversified from an industry, size, and geography
perspective with approximately 75% of deposits that are either insured, operational in nature or collateralized. In
total, approximately 75% of our deposits across all business lines are insured or collateralized by securities. And
our deposits are with customers we know has over 97% reside within our 15-state footprint.
Further supporting our high-quality deposit franchise, we had access to total primary liquidity of approximately $41
billion at the end of the quarter, sufficient to cover uninsured retail and non-operational wholesale deposits by

more than a 2 to 1 ratio. If you include access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, available liquidity
increases to $54 billion or approximately 3 to 1 coverage.
We have a strong team of bankers and the recent disruption has given us an opportunity to connect with our
customers and top prospects to answer questions and reassure them of our stability. We've experienced some
deposit outflows as corporate treasuries look to diversify and sought higher interest rates for their excess cash.
However, we've also experienced deposit inflows from new and existing customers. Importantly, our total deposits
at March 31 were roughly unchanged from what they were prior to the onset of liquidity concerns in the industry.
A majority of the $3 billion deposit decrease this quarter was as expected, due primarily to further normalization in
corporate deposits which had dramatically increased during the pandemic, as well as a continuation of rate-
seeking behavior in certain wealth and higher balance consumer accounts.
From a lending perspective, our focus on risk-adjusted returns continues. Overall sentiment among our corporate
customers remains positive. While most are forecasting strong performance in 2023, they are expecting modest
declines from levels seen in 2022. While current market conditions warrant heightened caution, we believe our
strong liquidity profile provides an advantage in terms of supporting our customers' borrowing needs.
In closing, despite all the industry turmoil, we feel very good about our balance sheet and strong liquidity position.
And through our proactive hedging strategies, we are positioned for success in any interest rate environment. Our
granular deposit base and relationship-based banking model continue to serve us well, and we're proud to
continue supporting our customers' banking needs.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 2% sequentially. Average business
loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the utilities,
retail trade and financial services industries, approximately 87% of this growth was again driven by existing clients
accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses. Average consumer
loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and interbank was partially offset by continued pay-downs in home
equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we continue to expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately
4%.
From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and competitive advantage, with balances
continuing to largely perform as expected. Previously, we indicated that combination of rapidly rising interest rates
and normalization of surge deposits would likely lead to $3 billion to $5 billion of deposit declines by midyear
before we would begin to generate net deposit growth.
While the events in March created turmoil in the banking industry, we continue to believe that range is
appropriate. However, we may be at the higher end of the range as we approach mid-year. The preponderance of
deposit outflows this quarter occurred prior to early March and were in line with our expectations.
Approximately $2 billion of the $3 billion outflow came from corporate deposits reflecting normal seasonal activity.
The other $1 billion came from a continuation of rate seeking behavior among certain wealth and higher balance
consumer clients. The same characteristics that contribute to our deposit advantage in a rising rate environment

are also helpful in a time of systemic volatility. As John noted, our focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and
granular deposit base with high primacy drives loyalty and trust and instills funding stability.
So let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income continued to expand with market interest rates
in the first quarter, reflecting our asset-sensitive profile and funding stability. Net interest income grew 1% linked
quarter to a record $1.4 billion, and net interest margin increased 23 basis points to 4.22%. As the Federal
Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and
cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of low-yielding loans
and securities generated through the pandemic.
At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect accelerating deposit costs through repricing and remixing. Importantly,
recent trends remain within our expectation. The cycle to date deposit beta is 19% and our guidance for 2023 is
unchanged, a 35% full-cycle beta by year end. We remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a
meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry.
Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of
the range is supported by the March 31 market forward yield curve, which projects nearly 75 basis points of rate
cuts in 2023, and stable Fed funds level would push net interest income to the upper end of the range.
The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of our earnings stability in today's uncertain
environment. Hedges added to-date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. Forward-
starting receive-fixed swaps will become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of
three years. Activity in the first quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025.
In addition to forward-starting swaps, we added a $1.5 billion collar strategy selling rate caps to pay for rate floors
to limit exposure to extreme market rate movements. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net
interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates
remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain above the high end of the range until deposits fully
reprice.
So let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income declined 3% from the prior quarter
as modest increases in service charges and wealth management income were offset by declines in other
categories, primarily capital markets and card and ATM fees.
Service charges increased slightly as seasonally higher treasury management fees offset declines in overdraft
fees. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 4% sequentially as growth in real estate
capital markets, loan syndications, and debt and securities underwriting more than offset declines in M&A fees
and commercial swaps. We did have a negative $33 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting lower long-term
interest rates, volatility in credit spreads as well as a refinement in our valuation methodology.
Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by a $5 million increase in reserves driven by higher reward
redemption rates. With respect to our outlook and incorporating first quarter results, we expect full-year 2023
adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 1% compared to the prior
quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to merit and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. FDIC
insurance assessment reflects the previously announced industry-wide increase in the assessment rate
schedules.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
In contrast to the prior two years, we expect first half 2023 adjusted expenses to be higher than the second half of
the year, and we continue to expect full-year 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%. We
now expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%.
From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs
were 35 basis points in the quarter. Non-performing loans and business services criticized loans increased, while
total delinquencies decreased.
Provision expense was $135 million, while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%. The
amount of the allowance increased, due primarily to economic changes and normalizing credit from historically
low levels, partially offset by a reduction associated with the elimination of the accounting for troubled debt
restructured loans. It is worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in
our results.
I'll take a few minutes to speak to our commercial real estate portfolio. Since 2008, we have deliberately limited
our exposure to this space. At quarter end, our exposure totaled 15% of loans, excluding owner occupied, and it
is highly diverse. This total includes $8.4 billion of investor real estate and $6.7 billion of unsecured exposure, of
which the vast majority is within real estate investment trust. Our REIT clients generally have low leverage and
strong access to liquidity, with 68% classified as investment-grade.
Importantly, total office represents just 1.8% of total loans at $1.8 billion. Of note, 83% consist of Class A
properties, with 62% located within the Sunbelt. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate weighted
average loan-to-value of 58%, and we have stressed the portfolio to include a 25% discount using the Green
Street Commercial Property Price Index, with a weighted average resulting loan-to-value of the book
approximating 77%.
It is also noteworthy that 37% of our secured office portfolio is single-tenant. While we are carefully monitoring
conditions, we believe our portfolio will be able to weather the weakness in the industry.
Including first quarter results, we now expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis
points. Given the recent economic uncertainty and market volatility, we may see a pickup in the pace of
normalization towards our through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points over time.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.8%,
reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth and approximately
$100 million or 7 basis points related to the phase-in of CECL into regulatory capital. Given current
macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate managing capital levels at or modestly above
10% over the near term.
So, in closing, we delivered solid results in the first quarter despite volatile conditions. We have balance and
diversity on both sides of the balance sheet, and are well-positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions.
We're in some of the strongest markets in the country. And while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential
market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers.
Pre-tax, pre-provision income remained strong, expenses are well controlled, credit remains broadly stable, and
capital and liquidity levels remain robust.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
David, maybe a question on betas and deposit balances. So you guys are one of the few that isn't increasing your
deposit beta guidance, given that you're at 19% and I think expectations are for 35%. Can you maybe just talk
about where you expect the pressure to come from? I think you noted in the remarks re-pricing and remixing. How
much will each of these contribute? Are you expecting more to be in retail, given the push for insured deposits, or
is it on the commercial side?
And then, second, you noted that you do expect to see stabilization of growth in balances later in the year. Can
you maybe just talk about what you see driving that as we move through the year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So as we've mentioned before, we had $41 billion worth of surge deposits. We didn't think those would stay
with us as long as they actually have stayed with us. And we've furthermore said, as rates continue to increase,
that people would be seeking higher returns than we were offering at the time. And so you can see our cumulative
beta, as you mentioned, at 19%, well below everybody else.
We do understand that we're going to end up – there's going to be a shift to deposits into CDs, more expensive
deposits. And so we do also expect some continued runoff. We have given you the guide of $3 billion to $5 billion
and we're now $3.3 billion. We expect to be at the upper end of that by the end of the second quarter. And a lot of
that is putting money to work and businesses but also some seeking higher rates.
And so, it's a combination of where we are relative to our deposit cost, relative to the peers would imply that we
would be increasing some of that over time and that's going to drive our beta. And we still believe 35% is the right
number by the end of the cycle, which we're calling the end of this year.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, so you guys are now expecting losses at the high end of your previous
guidance. It looks like the increase this quarter was driven by C&I. And I think, David, I think you just noted you
could see a pickup in the pace of normalization. Can you maybe just talk about one, what is driving the
incremental pressure and what are you expecting to be the higher driver of charge-offs both for the rest of this
year and then the pace of normalization that we could see? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, so as we've stated many times, the charge-off level is below normal and we said it would be normalizing
over time. We've furthermore set our normalized loss rate based on the risk profile. We maintain a 35 basis points
to 45 basis points. As we get through the end of this year, we're trying to give you the message that that could
kind of lead you into a run rate towards that 35 basis points to 45 basis points by the end of the year.
We're already at 35 basis points this quarter, which would imply we expect a reduction in charge-offs and the
second and/or third quarter. But all in, we still think we're going to be at 35 basis points, which is below normal. So
we have a lot of confidence in that. We had certain things that happened in the first quarter we don't think will
repeat. And so, I think our 35 basis points is a pretty good number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ryan, I'd just add to the question about where we're seeing the stress. We've identified a couple of areas
on previous calls where we are experiencing some stress in the portfolio. That would be health care where we're
seeing rising cost and pressure on labor; transportation, particularly on the smaller end of the transportation
sector where customers are competing in the spot market to move product; consumer discretionary, where
consumers are changing their buying patterns and moving away from more discretionary items towards services
where we're seeing some pressure; office, obviously; and then senior housing, which is a sector that we believe is
improving but still not returned to occupancy levels that we experienced prior to pandemic. And again, it's a sector
where labor is a factor and the operations of those businesses and driving cost up.
So those are all areas where we are seeing more pressure than in the rest of the portfolio. And I would finally
comment, I think we'll see some additional "movement" toward normalization. But we probably gotten there a little
faster than I think we thought we would. So we don't expect a whole lot of additional deterioration as we move
toward normalization.

Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is for David You continue to have that line about a long-term NIM of 3.6% to 4%. I think investors
are starting to think about rate cuts in 2024. And I'm loath to always ask about 2024 but I think investors are
thinking about how inexpensive bank stocks are really right trying to evaluate them on what could be trough
earnings next year.
So, if the Fed cuts, can you still stay within that range? And I think nobody's expecting a cut to zero, but, perhaps,
walk us through the scenario of that range in the scenario of like a 200-basis-point cut over one year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the bottom line answer is, yes, we do feel comfortable under any scenario, as we mentioned, that we
would operate in that 3.60% to 4% range. Clearly, our guidance is based on the market. I mean, on the March 31
forward, it has three cuts, 75 basis points worth of cuts after one increase.
So to the extent that were to happen, we will still be within that range. If it stays higher than that, then we'd be at
the upper end of the range and we have some receive-fixed swaps that actually come onboard in the second half
of the year to protect us from lower rates.
We're not saying that the rates will be cut. That's what the market says. I personally don't see that that will happen
at that pace, but we wanted to be able to center the discussion on what the market's seeing and that's why we
gave you that and then we gave you some sensitivity around it. So we feel very good about the range.
Where we are in the range, there are a whole lot of factors, the pace, the timing of cuts that would take us down.
Even if we had a couple of hundred basis points of cuts in 2024, we're still in the range. So does that get you what
you wanted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes. And as we think about perhaps a more measured pace of cut, how would you anticipate being able to
formalize your deposit costs in that backdrop?

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. How quickly could you lower deposit costs in an environment where the Fed is cutting in a measured pace?
I'm just trying to think about the other side as I think about sort of your long-term NIM target range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, so you could see our deposit cost relative to our peers at a 19% bear are lagging. And so, the ability
to cut, we have to be competitive. We have to offer a fair price to our customer base. And I think to the extent you
start seeing a pause and/or cuts coming from the Fed, the beta that we just mentioned could change and may not
be as severe.
What happens is the increase in deposit costs lagged the last increase of – that the Fed is going to have. So it'll
take some time for that to manifest itself. So if you look at the retail side, the retail side is very slow to react. But
on the commercial side, it's almost instantaneous as treasurers look to lock in the best yield that they can. We
have some index deposits that move with changes in Fed funds. So that'll react pretty quickly, which, I think, is a
benefit to us in that scenario.

In terms of your maintaining the cumulative or through-cycle beta, 35%, I hear you where you're trending out 19%
and you're confident. But I'm just curious how the liquidity crisis through March and how it really impacted that
outlook. We saw a number of other banks increase their deposit beta their expectations, given the intensifying
pressure around deposit costs as well as broader funding costs. So how has the liquidity crisis impacted your
view and how does that not influence an increase in how you're thinking about the through-cycle data? If you
could just walk us through that. Thanks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. So our – this is – our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And so, we haven't had to react at
the pace of others. So if you look at the incremental beta of our core peer group, that was some 73% this quarter
and ours was 40% – 41%. So we just haven't had to move at the pace. And I still think, based on how we fund
ourselves, the core retail, 70% of our deposits being retail, really has helped us from being able to keep that beta
where it is at 35%.
So as we think about some of the larger customers that are seeking rates, seeking returns, that's where there has
been more competitive pressure. And we saw some of that being put to work in the first quarter. And we called for
some of that. That's part of the $3 billion to $5 billion that we're talking about. As a matter of fact, in our beta
assumption, we had all that coming out of non-interest-bearing. That wasn't quite what we saw, but we assumed
non-interest-bearing because that was more conservative to give you the guidance.
And so, if you take all that into consideration, I think that's why you didn't see us change our cumulative beta to
35%. And being at 19%, there's a long way to go from 19% to 35%. We understand that. But if we miss it, maybe
it's a tad underneath that, which is why we gave you also some guidance on our slide number 7 that would show
you if beta was a little bit better than 35%, how much it might be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks, David. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the capital front, I know you increased your target
to 10%. And so, just if you could – or 10% or just above, I believe, you said. If you could maybe give us a little bit
more color in terms of the rationale. And then, could that allow for buybacks at some point? How are you thinking
about deployment and the pace of where you – the timing of when you get to around that 10% range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So you saw our Common Equity Tier 1 increase from 9.6%to 9.8%, and that's after absorbing about 7 basis
points due to the CECL impact for the first quarter. So we're generating 20 to 30 basis points worth of CET1 every
quarter after loan growth. We, first and foremost, want to be here as a source of strength for our customers and
be able to make all creditworthy loans we can make. And we're open for business and ready to do that. That's
what our job is.
We want to make sure we pay our shareholders a fair dividend; 35% to 45% of our earnings in the form of a
dividend, and we have been at the lower end of that. And then, we've used our capital for other non-bank
acquisitions and mortgage servicing right acquisitions, which we'd like to continue. And then, to optimize our
capital, we'll buy stock back from time to time.
Given the uncertainty that's in the market, obviously, there's a lot of review going on to what happened in the
month of March; and there's going to be some reports coming out from our regulatory supervisors on what may
change. And we just want to be prepared for that, and we think it would be inappropriate at this time to be buying
our stock back when we have this kind of uncertainty.
You lop on top of that the uncertainty in the economy and monetary policy. So there's just a lot of noise which
caused us to rethink, well, let's just wait, let us accrete up to that 10%, maybe slightly over that. And to the extent
things settle down, then we'll optimize capital and we'll use share repurchases as a mechanism to do so.

Matt O'Connor Q

How are you thinking about managing liquidity going forward? Obviously, like, with a very strong deposit base,
you've been less reliant on wholesale borrowing. But both in light of current conditions and then just kind of the
way the regulation might be moving, what are you thinking about in terms of borrowings and then also both cash
and securities? And again, like, you've got a smaller AFS book than others, which has worked well given the
move in rates. But what's the outlook on both the funding and asset side? Thanks.

standpoint.
Clearly, some things have changed. We've given you a list of our total primary liquidity and also liquidity at the
discount window should we need it. What we've learned, I think, over this is that it can move much quicker than
we all had anticipated. The world has changed a bit. And so we've had one of the largest cash balances of
anybody in the peer group, the lower securities but we did that intentionally because we were not clear on those
surge deposits on the pace that they would move out.
So we'll probably maintain a bit more cash than we historically have been. Obviously, there's a – currently, there's
a new term bank facility that the Fed created that's temporary. I hope there's a thinking about how to maybe keep
some of that in place. But we did not use that, as you could tell from our disclosures. But we tested it after quarter
end just to make sure the pipes were worked up. And I think we borrowed $1,000 and repaid it quickly.
But posting collateral to something like that that you can get access to quickly, clearly the Federal Home Loan
Bank is still our primary source we go to. We have a little bit outstanding there at quarter end, couple billion

dollars. And so just having access to multiple levels, if we learned anything, it's diversification. And you need to
make sure your funding side is diverse. And within your deposit base, it needs to be diverse. So you can't – if you
end up with a concentration, you end up with a problem. So I think that's a big lesson learned for everybody. And
staying as diverse as we can, a little more cash on hand, I think, is in order.

And then specifically on the securities book, how would you think about that relative to assets kind of near or
longer term with the current framework?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
We've historically been in that 20% range of earning assets and we don't see that changing dramatically. I think
we need to be careful. There's been a lot of discussion about shortening up maturities and things of that nature.
And we need to be real careful because there could be broad implications of that. The banking system is a big
buyer of mortgage-backed securities and we need to support the mortgage industry and the housing industry and
consumers that way. So we are forced to go too short.
There are much broader implications for the economy. So we're going to be careful of that. We'll see what the
policymakers come up with and we'll adapt and overcome as we see fit. But right now, I think having a book about
where we've been, which is a little lower than others, I think is the right spot for us based on our, again, our
funding profile.

commercial real estate. Can you guys share with us the differences that you are seeing in the current commercial
real estate market in your portfolio versus what it was like in 2008-2009?
Now, granted I know you've lowered the exposure, so that's a major difference. But in terms of the cap rates
obviously have moved up. The refinancing risk is here. But can you share with us how you guys could handle that
more – I'm assuming more easily today than what happened in 2008-2009.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gerard, this is John. I would say, we rebuilt our business, beginning in kind of the 2009-2010 timeframe,
recognizing that it's a very much specialized business. And we've built it around professional real estate bankers
who are working with professional real estate developers. Generally, they're either regional or national
developers. They have strong capital positions, good access to liquidity, strong track records. They're operating in
some of the primary markets across the US.
We rebuilt our business with a focus on concentration risk management. So it's well distributed. The portfolio is
across different segments of the industry as well as across geographies. We have built the business, I think, very
conservative from a structural standpoint, requiring good equity in projects and we're constantly stressing our
exposure. It's a relationship business for us.
We're transacting with customers who maintain deposit relationships with us who use our capital markets
capabilities. We're very close to those customers and as a consequence, we have a very good handle on the
exposure that we have across the business. And we have the benefit of operating in some of the best markets in
the country as well.
You look at markets like Dallas and Houston, Orlando, Charlotte, Atlanta, Nashville, where we're doing business
and where the majority of our portfolio resides. We have good, good underpinning economy to help support the
projects as well.

And maybe, David, on a technical question regarding the commercial real estate, how does the elimination of
TDRs now help or hinder your guys working out with some of your customers that may inevitably have an issue
with their property?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we're not going to let an accounting change, change our – what we are going to do for our customer. If we
need to have a restructuring, then that's what we'll do and we'll let the accounting it is what it is. So I don't think
that'll impact us at all, Gerard, from – moving forward just like we always have.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Good morning. You guys had pretty solid average loan growth this quarter and did maintain the period-end
outlook. Can you just talk about loan demand? And then, secondly, if there's any areas maybe where you're
tightening underwriting standards or being more selective at this stage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we – obviously, in this economy, we want to be thoughtful about any new relationships that we acquire
and any new credit that we book. I would like to think that we're not changing our underwriting standards, that
they're consistent across all economic cycles. But at the same time, when you think about allocation of capital and
lending into this environment, we want to be thoughtful and prudent. We want to make sure that any new
business we get as a result of calling activity that's been ongoing for some time, we understand the relationship,
potential, and opportunity that we have a good plan.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
The bulk of the loan growth that we've experienced in the wholesale business has been loans to existing
customers. And in the last quarter, EBITDA growth was in our industry verticals, particularly in power and utilities,
energy and the industrial space. We're also seeing a little growth within our Regions Business Capital business,
asset-based lending business during this period of time.
And then on the consumer side, mortgage grew and interbank grew as a result of putting mortgage because we're
generating some ARMs during the period, on balance sheet ARMs on a period like this.
I think loan growth clearly – or loan pipelines, I should say, on the wholesale side of the business are down. And I
think that reflects caution on the part of customers, as well as projects, just the economy slowing a bit as a result
of rising rates and increasing cost.
We still believe, given some of our view of the future and known projects that are either underway or will get
underway, there is – we have an opportunity to grow loans. I think we're going to about 4% between now and end
of the year, and we should see growth in the same categories that I just described.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, Peter, I'll add to that. As part of the growth outlook, it is because of the markets that we operate in.
We've been the recipient of a lot of migration of people and businesses into where we operate. And so our
economy here is a bit different than certain other economies around the country, and I think that that's given us
some confidence that our 4% loan growth is reasonable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Very helpful. And if I could ask about the guidance on the deposit service charges, still $550 million.
Question is how should we think about the second half of the year from the impact of that grace period? Will it
step down to, I guess, around $120 million, and could you offset some of that with just account growth and cross-
selling treasury management services?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yes. So you can see that our – if you annualize where we ended up in the first quarter, we would be above the
$550 million. And that's an acknowledgment that our last change of 24-hour grace actually goes in the beginning
of the second – of the third quarter. And so you're going to see that step down more so in the third and fourth
quarter than you have seen because we had made the change.
One of the things that we've been the recipients of is our treasury management, investments we've made on
people and technology have really helped offset, to some degree at least, the decline we're seeing from the
consumer service charges. And we expect that to continue. So we're up some 8% there in TM. And if this
continues at that pace, we might have a better answer for you next earnings call. But right now, we're calling for
$550 million and with a step down in the second half of the year.

Hey, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Just a follow-up also on the fee side. I know, obviously, it's been a tough start to the year in capital
markets and you're reiterating that $60 million to $80 million zones that kind of were in, in the first quarter. Just
maybe can you give us color on just how that business is feeling and acting in terms of pipelines and expectations
and whether or not you anticipate there being a – is there a bounce built into your expectation in the second half?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We do, Ken, expect events to pick up in the second half of the year. It's still, I would say [indiscernible]
(00:45:50), but the second quarter will probably look a lot like the first is our guess. A good bit of our business is
built around real estate capital markets and our real estate customers, and that business has just been really,
really slow.
And if you look at the component parts of our business, generally speaking, whether it's syndications revenue,
revenue generated from fixed income placement or derivative sales, it's been pretty good over the course of the
first quarter. But the real estate capital markets have been very soft. M&A was pretty good in the first quarter. We
expect that to be true through the balance of the year. So I think we're guiding to pick up in the second half of the
year, and we believe that's very possible.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
And just for clarification to make sure, Ken, that when John said you should expect the second quarter to look like
the first quarter, that's ex CVA/DVA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A

Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
So we're talking about the lower end of – probably in the middle of the $60 million to $80 million range is about
where we would expect that. And we don't expect to have a CVA/DVA adjustment quite as volatile as you just saw
this quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Appreciate that. Yeah. And second question, just on the loans side. As far as the outlook goes, when you think
about just the combination of either your supply of credit and the demand of credit and this changing environment
that we're in, just what's happening on the lending side of things in terms of how the environment is changing
that? Are you guys tightening up at all? Is it more about the end client that's changing their demand functions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, naturally, in a softening economy, if you will, we are going to probably be a little more conservative,
even though I would say that we like – as I said a few minutes ago, we like to think that our underwriting
standards don't change from economic period to economic period.
We are in some very good markets, as David pointed out. And while pipelines are softer, we see people that are –
still have opportunities. We want to be smart about client selectivity all the time, probably even more so during
periods like this. We want to support our existing customers, and some 90% – almost 85% in round numbers of
loan growth we've experienced in the last quarter was to existing customers. So we are acquiring some new
customers, but being very thoughtful about that.
And then, separately, while our economies are good and we do see some opportunity, pipelines are down
because of, I think, customer caution related to still difficulty acquiring labor. There are two open jobs in the
southeast for every one person looking for a job. So labor market is still tight. And cost, while moderating, have
risen fairly significantly, including interest cost, obviously, which puts pressure on projects.
So I think for the balance of the year, we'll probably see pipelines will have moderated and stayed fairly muted,
but we believe we can deliver the loan growth that we're projecting despite that.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
In the past, you've talked a little bit about the fact that you're not going to need debt financing for, I don't know,
several quarters. And I just wanted to see if you could give us an update on how you're thinking about that,
18


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
especially as you – even though your size doesn't come into the current TLAC expectations, there is the potential
for that to happen over time and wanted to hear how you're thinking about that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So from a debt financing standpoint, we borrowed a little bit from the FHLB, as you saw. But the larger term
financing, we said we'd push out probably till the second half of the year. We don't know what the regime is going
to be, if there will be any change pushed down to us from a TLAC standpoint. At some point, whether we have
that or not, we need some more term financing, some term debt that we'll put on. And so, I think that we can make
sure we deal with that over time.
Betsy, I would say that the changes that are at least being batted around right now, you can't move too fast
because we all can't go out there and raise a bunch of debt at the same time. It'd be tough for the market to
absorb. So I think any change that might be coming relative to that would be over time. And I still think there is
going to be some tailoring. What that looks like, what that means, we'll have to find out, see what our regulatory
supervisors and policymakers decide.
But outside of something like that, we have a little bit of term debt that we need to get done. And that's really
pointed towards the back half of this year and, that said, are included in our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And that was something that you had been talking about for a while. Just wondering if it's feasible to give
us a sense as to size, if that's reasonable or not.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
No, we haven't done that yet. So we're still working out what that needs to look like and precise timing, too. But
we don't expect it this first half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, separately, could you just give us a sense on the expense outlook that you've got for 2023, the
kinds of levers that you have to keep the expense guide in the range that you've got, 4.5% to 5.5%, and if there is
anything in particular that you could point us to in terms of opportunities for efficiency improvement from here?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a great question. We try to – not try. We gave guidance that our first quarter was going to be a high
watermark. I'm not sure that made it into everybody's expectations, but it is what it is. We're now giving you
guidance again that we think the first half of the year will be higher than the second half of the year. We had some
things that we knew were coming in the first half, including we moved our merit month – our merit increase up a
month from April to March. So you've seen that in our first quarter.
And in any event, I think when you look at the way to work on expenses, the first thing are salaries and benefits
and making sure that you've got the right people, right number of the right people doing the right things and I think
19


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
that's always a challenge. And we continue to look at process improvement, leveraging technology so that when
we have attrition, natural attrition, perhaps we don't have to backfill those people if we can move that at the same
time.
We've looked at our occupancy. I do think return to work is still trying to find its way, but we likely to have more
square footage than we need, whether it be in the branch base or the office space. And so we have a team
constantly working on square footage, which is our second highest cost.
From a technology standpoint, we're having to make room to go through our transformation we're working on right
now. And so those costs are going up and we're able to have cuts in other places to pay for it.
Vendor spend is another area where we really make sure that we limit our use of consultants, or contracts with
vendors. We just make sure we get the best deal we can and we have a team working on that. So there is a cost
pool in this company that's not going to go through some type of challenge during this year because you don't
have a tailwind in 2024 from rates. So you've got to do – start working on your expenses today to help 2024 and
we're doing that. And so we have pretty good confidence in our expense number, that 4.5% to 5.5% right now for
this year.

proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the adjusted revenue guidance. Obviously, I
can appreciate that would be down a little bit given the funding pressures industrywide. But as I look at your
results from this quarter, it kind of feels like they were within guidance from last quarter and the NIM was
exceptionally high. So it just feels like you might be ahead of schedule versus having to pare that guidance back.
So I wonder if you can walk me through the main drivers of that reduction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, there are two primary drivers. The first is we used in our guidance the March 31 forward curve that had 75
basis points worth of cuts in the year with one increase. So you're down into the $450 million range by the end of
the year. So we then try to sensitize that. And we told you if that wasn't quite there, how much that may mean.
And you can see that on page 7 of the deck. So that was number one.
Number two, we just had – our capital markets was down quite a bit in the first quarter, primarily driven by – a
portion of it driven by the CVA/DVA adjustment. We don't think that will repeat at that level, but nonetheless, it's in
the number. And so you're already down that. So we didn't carve that out as an adjusted item. That's in our core
number. Some people adjust and some people don't. What we do is provide that and let you do what you want
with it. But when we're giving you guidance, it's in our number, in our core number.
20


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2023
And so those are the two big drivers. We've already given you guidance that our service charge number is likely
to go down because we're going to offer up 24-hour grace, and we're not exactly sure what that'll mean. But we've
taken an estimate and we've given you the $550 million for service charges and we'll update as we learn. But
those are probably the big three.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Very helpful, David. And then I guess just one maybe high-level kind of question. I mean, it feels like your
business model has really proven itself out right now. You're in just a phenomenal position from a deposit
perspective and you've diversified your loan book so much over the last few years. I guess, as you look at the
environment today, is there anything you would have done differently or anything you would have structured
differently, knowing what I guess we've learned since March 8 or what have you? Or do you feel like you've done
what you would have wanted to do regardless?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Stephen, I think we've – we really are – our core of our franchise are our customers and the people that work here
and we have a fabulous customer base, deposit base. We've said that for many, many years, even when rates
were zero, virtually zero, and you didn't see the benefit of that rising rates. And of course, having a liquidity
challenges all proved the business model out.
So we certainly wouldn't change that and we wouldn't change our focus on thinking of our customer on the right
side of the balance sheet in the form of a checking account or an operating account. That's really worked well for
us. We've brought on some really talented people in our company, in particular our technology area. We brought
on some very good people in the revenue areas that are doing a great job for us.
And so I just think in sticking to fundamentals of banking is what we've done. It's what John's asked us to do.
We're not trying to take big bets on anything, we're just trying to keep it down the fairway. And to me, steady as
she goes has been the way and may not be flashy, but it seems to be paying off for us. And I think it would just
stay on that soundness profitability and growth. Those are the three words John asked us to use in that order.
And if we stick to that, we're going to have a pretty good franchise. It's going to be less volatile than many of our
peers and certainly less volatile than we used to be pre-crisis.
So I don't see a lot of change. We need to get better and leverage technology in some areas where we're using
human capital. And that's just – that's on the to-do list and we're trying to get after it.
