Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
our strong earnings are really due to our diversified business model, which has long been called our strategic
identity. It also reflects extraordinary dedication by our employees who are serving our customers in all aspects of
our business in a very difficult environment. While there were aspects to our financial performance in 2021 that
will not recur in 2022, the business that created these opportunistic gains this quarter are franchise.
Starting on slide 4, full year net income was $618 million or $8.95 per diluted share, an increase of $183 million or
$2.76 per diluted share. Shown on slide 4, fourth quarter net income was $117.3 million or $1.71 per diluted
share. That represents a $71 million decline in net income from last quarter's all time quarterly high, which
benefited from a non-recurring gain on sale of an alternative investment, as well as market conditions that were
favorable to our mortgage-backed securities activities within our institutional trading business.
The key items that drove our decline in linked quarter net income were our fee-based business units continue to
perform well, recognizing the fourth quarter is historically lower than the third quarter. Linked quarter fee income
was down $44 million, with a $33 million decline in trading and brokerage fees, all driven by unfavorable market
volatility in our MBS institutional trading activities.
Mortgage fees decreased $5 million as production activity slowed and margins compressed. Other revenue
decreased $7.3 million as a result of lower operating revenue from repossessed oil and gas assets due to the sale
of a property. All other operating revenue was down $28.3 million linked quarter, primarily related to a $31 million
gain realized in the third quarter from the sale of an alternative investment.
Net interest revenue declined $3.2 million on a linked quarter basis, largely driven by a $5 million decline in PPP
fees. This was partially offset by an increase in non-use fees from low utilization levels and a 1 basis point decline
in our interest-bearing cost of funds this quarter. We continue to experience some compression in yields on our
available for sale portfolio. However, that impact was materially offset by increased balances in our trading
portfolio.
Market conditions and credit trends continue to improve, allowing us to release an additional $17 million of our
loan loss reserve this quarter, which was $6 million less than the third quarter reserve release. We have released
$100 million in loan loss reserves for the full year.
Expense management remains quite strong. Although linked quarter direct expenses increased $8.2 million this
quarter, $5 million of which was a contribution made to our foundation that serves our communities. The
remaining increase in expenses is generally related to technology spend, a slight increase in business promotion
and some operational losses.
I'm very proud of our expense management this past year as total direct expenses increased only $13.4 million or
1.2%, with $10.8 million of that increase from increased employee medical spend coming off an unusually low
2020 as medical procedures were deferred from 2020 into 2021. These results reflect our disciplined approach to
expenses despite significant technology- and cyber-related investments.
Turning to slide 5, total loans were down $142 million for the quarter, with PPP loan forgiveness accounts for
$260 million of that contraction. We believe core loan growth turned a corner this quarter with an increase of $117
million or 2.4% annualized.
The good news here is that the growth is being driven by our C&I book, both in our specialized lending and
regional and corporate banking areas. Core C&I, excluding energy, grew 6% annualized and 11% including
energy. C&I commitments grew as well, with relatively no change in the core utilization rate, which positions us

well with plenty of growth capacity as the economy continues to rebound. The net linked quarter growth was
muted by continued payoffs in our commercial real estate group, however. We expect growth to resume there
after the first quarter.
Loans attributed to our Wealth segment grew $133 million this quarter or 29% annualized. Average deposits
increased another $2 billion this quarter and are $4.3 billion or 12% higher than the same quarter a year ago.
Assets under management or in custody in our Wealth Management business grew 6% linked quarter to $104.9
billion, surpassing the $100 billion milestone, largely due to sales activity and favorable markets. Compared to
December 31, 2020, assets under management or in custody are up $13.3 billion or 14.5%.
I'll provide additional perspective on our results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Marc Maun will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7, period end loans in our core loan portfolio were $19.9 billion, a linked quarter
increase of $117 million. As Stacy noted, we're optimistic we've reached a turning point in our loan trends. Total
C&I loans grew $331 million or 2.7% linked quarter, with growth in all categories. Commercial real estate was
down $286 million for the quarter, but we expect that payoff trend to reverse after the first quarter.
Loans to individuals grew $72 million linked quarter. Personal loans driven by our private wealth team increased
$120 million, while residential mortgage loans decreased $48 million. This was largely due to the resale of loans
previously sold into Ginnie Mae mortgage pools that the company repurchased when certain delinquency criteria
were met. Many loans purchased during the pandemic have since been [ph] cleared (00:08:06) and meet the
resale qualifications.
Energy balances rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, an increase of $193 million or 6.9% linked quarter.
Commitments grew faster than outstandings this quarter, so utilization levels remain low, providing ample
capacity for continued growth simply from current customer base. We expect to have growth in 2022, primarily
from M&A activity in this space, with minimal growth from drilling activity.
Given our long-term expertise and continuing strong commitment to the energy sector, we are recognized as a
leader in this space and we are well-positioned for strong growth in the coming year. Ancillary business for
customer hedging, investment banking and treasury for this segment set another new record for fee revenue this
quarter, topping last quarter's previous high with linked quarter growth just under 8%.
Healthcare balances also increased, up $67 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily driven by our senior housing
assisted living sector. Looking forward, we remain very confident in our ability to perform from both a growth and
credit standpoint in this portfolio as it remains a leader for us.
Core middle market C&I realized positive growth this quarter with linked quarter growth of $72 million or 1.2%.
C&I utilization levels have been running at historic lows, but ticked up slightly this quarter. Given such low
utilization levels, we still have significant capacity to increase outstanding loans as demand continues to come
back online without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition. A return to more normal utilization levels
organically adds about $600 million of core C&I loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty area.
Although only one quarter, given the broad-based growth this period, we're optimistic that C&I portfolio is
beginning to stabilize. And with key indicators pointing toward an improving economy, we're anticipating solid
growth throughout this year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Commercial real estate payoffs continued this quarter, with balances down another $286 million. We continue to
see borrowers use this low rate environment to refinance to the long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse market. 2020
was one of real estate's lowest years for portfolio turnover as many of the permanent markets were cautious. As
those have opened up, we see some catch-up activity that is inherently a sign of a healthy portfolio. We expect
these balances to grow in 2022 after the first quarter where we will still expect some level of payoffs. We have
plenty of capital allocated for this space to grow in 2022 and beyond.
PPP loan balance forgiveness was $260 million this quarter, reducing outstandings to only $276 million. Of the
remaining PPP balances, less than $40 million are of the 2020 vintage. We continue to work with our clients
through the forgiveness process and expect any future remaining balances to be minimal. We believe the fourth
quarter was the inflection point we have been looking for and are confident we are well-positioned to build off that
momentum and return to a normal loan growth cycle as we move into the first quarter of 2022. As supply chain
constraints ease and the economy benefits from the full impact of the fiscal stimulus, BOKF will be well-positioned
for accelerated loan growth.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to improve significantly as we move further out from
the pandemic. We continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan
portfolio. Excluding loans guaranteed by US government agencies, non-performing assets fell $17 million linked
quarter to $145 million. Over the last 12 months, non-performing assets are down $173 million or 54%. Overall
asset quality is better than pre-pandemic levels. These and other credit quality metrics, combined with continued
strength in the commodity prices and outlook for moderate growth in GDP and labor markets, resulted in a $17
million release in reserves this quarter.
We realized net recoveries of $714,000 for the fourth quarter, an improvement compared to $7.8 million in net
charge-offs for the third quarter. Net charge-offs have dropped to an average of 18 basis points over the past four
trailing quarters, which is at the lower end of our historical loss range. As we look forward to the next quarter, we
expect net charge-offs will continue to be at the lower end of our historical range. The combined allowance for
loan losses totaled $289 million or 1.45% of outstanding loans and unfunded commitments at quarter-end,
excluding PPP loans.
Non-accruing loans decreased $8 million from last quarter, primarily due to a reduction in non-accruing energy
and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by an increase in non-accruing healthcare loans. Potential
problem loans totaled $222 million at quarter-end, down from $333 million on September 30. Potential problem
energy, healthcare, services and general business loans all decreased compared to the prior quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 10, total fees and commissions were $146 million for the fourth quarter, a $44
million decline from third quarter. The third quarter saw record-setting revenues from our Wealth Management
group, largely driven by increased institutional trading and sales related to mortgage-backed securities activities
with higher trading volumes and spreads which were heightened by intentional moves to shorter duration paper.
Fourth quarter trading volume declined as many investors moved to the sidelines on the news of the upcoming
taper by the Fed, year-end balance sheet management and concerns over yield steepening in the curve. The
result was a $39 million linked quarter decline in trading revenues. This was partially offset by increased

commercial syndication fees and derivatives, resulting in a net linked quarter decline in brokerage and trading of
$33 million or 69%.
Regarding our MBS trading activities, we expect the balance sheet usage to remain fairly consistent through the
next several quarters and trading volumes to increase as investors get more active post year-end. We're
expecting continued compression in the margin, primarily due to increasing interest rates.
Banking products and services for private wealth clients continue to be a particular area to highlight. The total
loan portfolio increased $133 million or 6.6% linked quarter and has increased $250 million or just over 13% since
December 31, 2020. The deposit portfolio, ending the quarter at $4.3 billion, grew 11% linked quarter and was up
11% compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Also, in the Wealth Management space, fiduciary and asset management fees were up almost 4% linked quarter
and 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The fourth quarter saw assets under management surpass
$100 billion with linked quarter growth of 6.1%, taking those balances to $104.9 billion. Compared to this time last
year, assets under management have grown $13.3 billion or 14.5%.
While we have seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances, sales activity
remained strong in this space as well. Our current mix of assets under management is 41% fixed income, 38%
equities, 14% cash, and 7% alternatives. Our relationship-driven business model is perfectly in touch with clients'
needs today as we continue to see institutions and individuals retain the increased appreciation for financial
advice gained through the past 18 months.
Transaction card revenue increased 1.5% linked quarter as activity volumes increased. For the full year, card
revenues are up 7.5% compared to 2021. This is largely due to stimulus measures and the broader reopening of
the US economy. Deposit service charges were down $711,000 this quarter, primarily centered in our Consumer
segment. On a total year basis, deposit service charges have increased $7.4 million from commercial activity.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased $5 million or 19% linked quarter, primarily due to lower production volumes
combined with narrowing margins. In addition to normal seasonal declines, industry-wide housing inventory
constraints continue to impact the market.
Our revenue declined $7.3 million or 39% linked quarter as a result of lower operating revenue from repossessed
oil and gas assets due to the sale of a property. Although not included on slide 10, I will also note that the net
income benefit in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $4.7 million in the
fourth quarter, down $2.6 million linked quarter.
Also, included in our total other operating revenue, but not reflected on slide 10, is a $25 million linked quarter
decline in gains and losses on other assets. This is due to the $31 million net gain we realized in the third quarter
from activity in our alternative investment group. As we noted last quarter, this area of focus is on providing equity
and debt capital to growing businesses, many of whom have been strong customers of BOK Financial. We expect
this area to continue to provide earnings in the future, with the timing difficult to predict.
I'll now turn the call to Steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items
for the quarter. Steven?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Thank you, Scott. Turning to slide 12, fourth quarter net interest revenue was $277 million, a $3.2 million decline
from last quarter that was primarily due to a $5 million linked quarter decline in PPP fees. Average earning assets
increased $1.2 billion to $44 billion compared to last quarter, primarily due to a growth in our average trading
securities portfolio to support our brokerage and trading business.
Interest-bearing cash increased $526 million. Average total deposits grew $2 billion, with non-interest deposits of
$1.1 billion this quarter, allowing us to reduce average other borrowings $1.7 billion linked quarter.
Net interest margin was 2.52%, down 14 basis points from the previous quarter, with the decrease primarily
driven by the continued PPP forgiveness activity, dilutive impact of a larger trading portfolio, and linked quarter
declines in core average loan balances. PPP loans supported net interest margin by 7 basis points in the third
quarter and 5 basis points in the fourth quarter. Excluding all PPP impact to both quarters' margins, fourth
quarter's net interest margin would be approximately 2.47%, down 11 basis points from last quarter.
The reinvestment of cash flows from our available for sale securities portfolio resulted in an 8 basis point linked
quarter decline in average yields, and the yield on our trading portfolio declined over 30 basis points. Additionally,
we had continued success driving net interest deposit costs down 1 additional basis point to 12 basis points on
average for the quarter. We believe the core margin is at a low point. However, we do not expect any meaningful
upward migration in net interest margin until rates begin to rise again.
Turning to slide 13, with anticipated rate hikes on the near-term horizon, it is important to highlight our current
asset sensitive balance sheet positioning, as well as to recall how well we performed during the last rate hike
cycle from 2015 to 2019. While we can't be assured to repeat the top quartile performance among regional banks
that we experienced last time, we don't see much that would lead us to believe the experience will be materially
different this time around. As you can see from our current interest rate risk estimate, we anticipate that if rates
increased 100 basis points gradually over 12 months, net interest revenue would increase over $50 million. We've
provided some additional context on expectations and assumptions affecting this projection, including our view
that we'll continue to hold the available for sale securities portfolio flat, keeping our asset sensitivity near current
levels.
Additionally, the majority of our loan book is variable rate or reprices within a year, with most of those repricing in
three months or less. As we've touched on during previous quarters, some of those variable rate loans are
impacted by rate floors, the impact of which will diminish as rates begin to rise.
Lastly, I'll highlight our expectation for our deposit betas or the rate at which we expect our deposit rates to
increase relative to market rates. While individual deposit betas will vary by type, we expect total deposit betas to
be approximately 17% in our 100 basis point gradual increase scenario, similar to those experienced coming out
of the last near zero rate environment. In fact, there is even more liquidity in the system today than before the last
rate increase cycle, which should diminish the need for the market to move rates up quickly.
On slide 14, you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong. Our loan-to-deposit ratio declined from
53% last quarter to just 49% at December 31, largely due to the $2.7 billion increase in total deposits this quarter.
This significant on-balance sheet liquidity leaves us well positioned to meet future increase in customer loan
demand.
Our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.2%, well ahead of our internal
operating range minimum. With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchase,
opportunistically repurchasing 129,000 shares at an average price of $104.46 per share in the open market.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Turning to slide 15, our expense management efforts were very successful this year, with total year-over-year
expense growth of only $13.4 million or 1.2%, with $10.8 million of that increase related to return to normal in
employee medical expenses. Linked quarter total expenses increased $8.2 million. However, $5 million of that
increase was related to a contribution to our foundation for the communities we serve.
Personnel expense decreased $1.4 million linked quarter with cash-based incentive compensation down due to
reduced trading activity. This was primarily offset by an increase in share-based compensation, resulting from
improved performance versus our peer group. Regular compensation expense continues to run fairly flat as it has
all year.
For the year, total personnel expenses increased $6.9 million or 1%, including the increase in medical spend
mentioned earlier. We expect to continue to manage personnel cost effectively going forward, but realize there is
risk here related to inflation that is beginning to show in the current labor market.
Non-personnel expense increased $9.6 million this quarter. As already noted, $5 million of increase is foundation
contribution. Additionally, professional fees, data processing and communications expense combined increased
$2.7 million as a result of various project investments.
On slide 16, I'll provide guidance in a few key areas as we begin 2022. We expect loan growth to accelerate as
we move through the year, with period-end point-to-point growth for the year in the 6% to 7% range. Line
utilization in our C&I portfolios is expected to increase in 2022, particularly in energy, but likely not completely
back to pre-pandemic levels during 2022. We expect growth in all of our regional markets and continued growth in
our Wealth division.
Deposits are expected to decline less than 2% point-to-point during 2022, with no significant change in deposit
composition or mix. We will maintain the available for sale securities portfolio flat during the year by reinvesting
cash flows at current rates. By keeping the securities portfolio leveled, we'll be able to maintain our asset
sensitivity to up 100 basis points spread across the first year at between 4.5% to 5% as it relates to net interest
income. [indiscernible] (00:26:11) second year impact of 100 basis points is expected to be above 11%.
Our deposit betas, a key assumption in determining rate sensitivity, will vary by type but average 17% for the first
100 basis point move, very similar to the experience coming out of the last near zero rate environment a few
years ago.
Core net interest income, excluding the impact of PPP between the years, is expected to grow 3.5%, driven
higher as loan growth picks up. Core net interest margin seems to have bottomed and we expect to see
improvement as the Federal Reserve starts hiking rates and loans begin to grow.
Total fee revenues will not repeat historically high levels of 2021. Trading and brokerage and mortgage revenue
will decline mid to upper single digits compared to last year. All other fee categories are expected to post mid-
single digit growth. Total fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues is expected to stay at or near 40%.
Our goal is to maintain operating expense growth at or below 2% for 2022. This will support operating leverage
and an improving efficiency ratio in concert with revenue growth from higher loan balances. Certainly, one risk in
this environment is labor inflation, which we'll watch closely and attempt to manage appropriately.

We expect the overall loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances to migrate towards 1.20% by the end of
2022, very close to the day one CECL levels. We expect to continue opportunistic quarterly share repurchase
within the total dollar ranges spent over the past several quarters.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.

Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steven. As I mentioned at the top of the call, I'm very proud of our record year of earnings during another
period of tremendous volatility. Although our lending businesses were challenged with significant deleveraging by
our clients, we continue to partner with our customer in strategies for their borrowing and expansion needs going
forward, have been successful in growing our customer base, positioning us well for growth in the near future.
Based on what we experienced this past quarter with growth in our core loan commitment and balance levels,
we're optimistic about growth in this area in the coming year. This past year has served as an excellent example
of the success of our diversified business model, as we've seen our fee-based businesses and our alternative
investment strategy generate earnings, while our lending outcomes were slowed by impacts of the pandemic.
Credit quality has improved to the point that we are now better than pre-pandemic levels. Over the long-term,
regardless of the cycle, our credit outcomes have long been a differentiator for us. While this quarter's earnings
were down from our third quarter record, we believe we are well-positioned across the company for growth in
2022. We expect external forces, such as supply chain and labor disruptions will continue to improve, as well as
other economic indicators that continue to show positive trends, all providing opportunities for growth.
Market expectations for a rising rate environment further enhance our potential outcomes as we are well well-
positioned for a rising rate. We operate in a fast-growing regional footprint that we expect to provide stronger
growth in the national economy over time. I'm excited about the future of BOK Financial.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. Just starting out with expenses, Steven, I know you commented on the weaker trading result is
driving the personnel costs a little bit lower this quarter, but [ph] we're kind of surprised that (00:30:40) seem more
of an offset there. Can we expect kind of a catch-up on that in 2022 or I guess, can you just comment a little bit
more on how those two are linked?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No. I think the biggest offset to that – we did see a decline in the commission-based expenses that hit personnel
costs this quarter. But we also offset that going the other direction with some stock-based compensation accruals
based on our estimation of our performance relative to our peer group, which you'll find in the proxy. So, we take
a look at that each quarter. We determine how are we going to perform relative to that peer group for a long-term
incentive. And we had an offsetting kind of – that number offset some of the decline that you saw on the
commission side for this quarter's personnel expense. Is that helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just turning to the balance sheet. You've separately kind of been
optimistic on energy – lending in energy vertical and healthcare. Could we expect those to grow a little bit faster
than the 6% to 7% growth rate that you put out there? And within that guidance, is there any improvement in the
utilization rate that you're baking into that?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Yeah. This is Mark Maun. As far as the energy market goes, we do expect to increase outstandings in that as
we'll see more M&A activity, potentially more drilling activity with prices as high as they are. We did do $1.4 billion
in new commitments during 2021. So the capacity not only increased as a result of oil prices and gas prices, but
also because of new customer capacity under the energy portfolio.
On C&I, we do expect utilization to recover. It's stabilized to date but hasn't fully recovered to a higher level. But
the key is our commitments have remained steady. So we really haven't lost any capacity in the C&I market. So
as the economy continues to perform, we expect utilization to improve.
Another key area of growth is going to be our CRE group. We did over $3 billion in new commitment approvals in
2021, the majority of which were construction loans. So as we expect and are guiding there, we expect payments
to be reduced following the first quarter. We will expect a natural funding of our CRE portfolio throughout 2022. So
all of those things combined give us a lot of comfort in our guidance on the loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
[ph] Yeah. On (00:33:33) the commercial real estate side, that $3 billion, I think, is a record for new commitments
in any single year, so strong production there. You just have the permanent markets that are creating just a little
bit of a headwind. But we're optimistic that as we get into the second quarter and beyond that what you're going to
see there are the hard work that created the strong growth in commitments really show up in CRE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. I guess, specifically within that, it's kind of hard to tell what the payoffs and paydowns in there. But are you
seeing – is the growth in, like, multifamily or office can get a little bit more – give a little more color around the
specific areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. Our focus has been in all four areas, but we are seeing more of the activity in our multifamily, in our
industrial areas as strong growth. And another component of our CRE group is our senior health group that
focuses on construction of new senior housing. It has a great quality track record in that. We've had no issues on
it for the past 10 years, and we see opportunities for growth in that area as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Great. Thanks. That's all from me. Thanks for answering my questions.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I know you're expecting available for sale balances to remain roughly flat from here, but what about the outlook for
trading securities? I know they've seen a lot of growth this year, especially in the fourth quarter. They're now over
$9 billion. What do you expect from that line going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Brady. This is Scott Grauer. So we expect it to be consistent with where we're at right now. We look for
that to really be fairly flat as we work throughout the course of the year. We think we've got it at a level that we're
comfortable with. We think it sustains kind of the activity flow that we're seeing, which obviously was challenged in
late October on into November. But we did see a pickup in December and we've seen the trend continue to
improve as we've operated thus far in January. So we think we look to hold that steady at this point throughout the
– as far as we can see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then, Steven, when you talk about the guidance of the reserve down to 120 basis
points by the end of the year, I just wanted to clarify, are you talking just about the allowance for loan losses or
the allowance for loan losses plus the reserve for off-balance sheet, like the 1.29% or the 1.45% is what you're
pointing to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think, we're talking about the 1.45%, so the combined reserve including unfunded commitments...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A

...towards the 1.20% level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. All right. And then finally for me, it's nice to see you guys buy back stock in almost every quarter last year in
2021. I think you repurchased it at around $85 or $90 and the stock is now north of $110. So how do you think
about the buyback going forward? And on the flip side, with the stronger currency that could potentially lead to

better bank M&A deals. Maybe just the balance of how you look at buybacks versus using your currency to
acquire?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So let me take the buyback and I'll let Stacy comment a little bit on M&A. But I think that buybacks will be
kind of an ongoing part of how we utilize some of our capital build and excess capital. You saw us buyback a little
bit of shares, not as much as we did certainly in the third quarter at the $85 mark. But we did buy some back in
the hundreds range, not as many.
So, I think going forward, you'll see us opportunistically kind of pick our spot, but utilize some cash. And I think I
guided to a similar level across multiple quarters, a similar level of total dollars that we'll spend to buy back
shares. I think it's kind of a normal part of what we do going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. On the M&A front, I think, clearly, our currency is better, but the sector has seen improvement there
as well. So, any target that we might have probably has seen improvement in their stock price as well.
Really, from my perspective, M&A is important, but not something that we're focused on. I think it's got to be
opportunistic. It's got to be the exact right fit. From my perspective, I'm more interested in product niches,
technology investments, things that we can do that aren't necessarily disruptive to the whole company to integrate
and to socially and culturally integrate. There could be that perfect opportunity. COVID was just a perfect fit for us
and everything that has gone on over time just continues to demonstrate what a great fit that was for our culture
and our company, and really accelerating our growth in Denver and Phoenix, particularly.
So, it would have to be something bigger than that. It would have to be something that similarly would fit our
culture that would be something that we could readily assimilate. But we're more interested in product lines or
other niches inside of our revenue streams that would be an add-on and not necessarily completely impact the
company.

Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks, guys. Appreciate the disclosures around the loan floors on slide 13. And it looks like you gave us that
76% of the commercial portfolios reprice in one year. I'm curious if you have the dollar amount of loans that will
reprice immediately with LIBOR or Fed funds, more of a near-term disclosure. Thanks.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I don't know if I can answer that specifically. I know that inside that 76%, I think 80% or more that reprices in less
than three months. So, I mean, it's very short.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Most of our LIBOR loans are [ph] in the one month category (00:40:10).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We don't do a lot of longer term tranches under the LIBOR scenario. It's going to be – the vast majority of that is
going to be really quick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, I guess, the guidance does assume that the Fed starts the hike in the middle part of the year.
Can you be more specific about what the assumptions are around rates, not just for Fed funds, but also on the
long end of the curve, which is relevant, obviously, given the size of your securities portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we gave disclosure of what would happen, we believe, if rates go up 100 basis points. But what we've
really – frankly, what we've built in our budget is a couple of rate increases beginning mid-year, starting whatever
the timeframe, May or June, and then another one out towards the end of the year. That's what we built in when I
guided to that 3.5% growth in net interest income on a core basis and that excludes any kind of differential in
PPP.
So that – hopefully that helps a bit in knowing kind of how we're thinking about it. I mean, certainly, there's lots of
predictions out in the market with forward increases, maybe even more. We chose not to build that that much into
our budget. We're a little bit more conservative perhaps than others, but that's how we calculated the guidance on
the growth of 3.5% core net interest income for 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We think – obviously, the market is moving around quite a bit here towards the beginning of the year in terms of
what they think the Fed is going to do. As we built our thinking and as Steven put together in the guidance that we
disclosed today around net interest income, we thought that the Fed would move likely slower, a bit slower than

the market anticipated. However, if someone has a different view, we've provided the level of disclosure there so
that you can just kind of bake that in and get an understanding of that.
Matt, you've done some of the best work I've seen in the analyst community on looking at the last time rates went
up but who actually was the most asset sensitive. And I think we all disclosed all these different things and
everybody's got a different assumption around deposit betas and when the Fed moves and all that kind of stuff.
But I think the core is we outperformed in the regional banks space the last time there was a rising rate cycle. And
I think there's nothing inherent or intrinsic in our balance sheet or how we operate the bank today that would lead
us to believe that there will be a different outcome this time. In fact, the system overall and certainly us, we've got
more liquidity than we've ever had. And so, if anything, I think banks will be more likely to move slower than they
did last time.
So we tried to provide kind of the fairway or the boundaries so that if folks have different views about that, they
can kind of interpolate. But certainly, I think the last rate cycle, if you look across the spectrum, is going to be one
of the best ways to try to compare banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Thanks for that, Stacy, and agree that the bank is in a relatively really good spot for higher rates.
And also, appreciate that the macro assumptions in the market seem to change week to week. So definitely
appreciate you guys just disclosing kind of what you did that will allow us to kind of work backwards there.
Switching gears over to the operating expense guidance for 2022, I think you're saying you want to maintain this
run rate, quarterly run rate around that $300 million per quarter that we saw in the fourth quarter. That'd be pretty
impressive given the wage inflation that we're hearing from other banks and just the general tax spend. What else
should we be mindful of that would allow the bank to have more moderate expense growth in 2022 versus many
of your peers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Your first assumption of kind of the quarterly progression around the $300 million, that's pretty close. I
mean, frankly, we put all our budgets together in a real detailed fashion. We think we can control personnel costs.
I did caution in our guidance that certainly wage inflation is there. It hasn't been – you see it showing up in some
spots in our company, but it hasn't been across the board an issue for us at this point.
Now, will it become that? We don't know. We said we'll watch it closely and manage that expense appropriately.
We do think we can maintain pretty good control of expenses. We're allowing some growth, I think, in business
promotion to help support our businesses. We're certainly allowing continued growth in some of our tech spend
and some of the projects that we have going to support those customer-facing type systems.
So there are some growth characteristics around the expense base in certain categories, but we still feel like we
can maintain the kind of control that we did in 2021 as we move through this current year.

Matt, this is Stacy. Just to add on there, I think, if you look at our turnover, our turnover per year in 2021 was
actually a little bit better than it was in the last kind of pre-COVID year 2019. And so while Steven alluded to
pockets, there are some pockets that we're watching a little more carefully. As a company overall, our turnover
levels are actually very good. And so it's a risk factor, one we're not – we certainly see what others are saying in
the market. Those appear to be kind of different types of banks, different types of positions and maybe a core
regional bank would be here located kind of in the middle of the country. But certainly, we feel good about our
ability to control expenses next year.

Clark Wright Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Good morning. This is Clark Wright speaking on behalf of Gary Tenner. Most of my questions were already
answered, just maybe a clarification on one. I was just wondering, when you're talking your outgoing operating
expenses and the 2% that you're guiding to, is there any offsetting savings that are factored into that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Not really. I mean, I think, to the previous analyst question, kind of the level that we see going forward of total
operating expenses is somewhere around that $300 million mark. We're just shy of that this quarter, although we
did include $5 million contribution to our foundation, so it would have been lower. But that's not a bad place to
start from a quarter-on-quarter basis.
