Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Since our last earnings call, we hosted our two major advisor
conferences for both the independent and employee affiliation channels and also had our Chairman's Council
recognition trip for our top employee advisors. I'm so proud of our advisors' unwavering dedication to serving their
clients and helping them to navigate these volatile and uncertain times. Our advisors have also expressed their
appreciation of our commitment to managing the firm for the long term and always striving to be a source of
strength and stability for them and their clients. It's these shared values that have resulted in our success through
multiple cycles since our founding and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future.
Now turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment and elevated market volatility since the Federal
Reserve started raising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the first nine months of
the fiscal year.
Reviewing third quarter results, starting on slide 4, the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion
and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding expenses
related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million or $1.85 per
diluted share. The increase in interest-related revenues driven by higher short term interest rates drove significant
earnings growth over the prior year. Net revenues increased 7% and net income available to common
shareholders grew 23%.
Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of
approximately $65 million and bank loan provisions for credit losses of $54 million, which was predominantly
driven by significantly weakened macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE Price Index utilized in our
CECL models.
Notwithstanding these items, we had a solid quarter in a tough market environment. We generated strong returns
with annualized returns on common equity of 14.9% and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity
of 19.7%. We believe this is a leading result, especially considering our strong capital base.
Moving to slide 5, the strength of our PCG business really shined, driving record assets this quarter. We ended
the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion, record PCG assets and fee based
accounts of $697 billion and financial assets under management of $201 billion.
With our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisors, PCG consistently
generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of $14.4
billion, representing a 5.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets. However
I'll note, net new assets in our advisor count were negatively impacted by an independent contractor relationship

whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter. This was a planned and mutual separation, and
more than 60% of the assets and advisors stayed with Raymond James.
The impact of the portion that moved off the platform this quarter was $4.6 billion in assets and 60 financial
advisors. Though our net new asset metric would have been even stronger after adjusting for this separation,
which we do not believe will negatively impact our profitability, during the prior 12 months, we recruited to our
domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately $282 million of
trailing 12-month production and nearly $38 billion of client assets at their previous firms.
Total clients' domestic sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 11%
from March of 2023. The Enhanced Savings Program, with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance,
continued to attract significant cash this quarter, offsetting a decline in client suite balances largely due to
quarterly fee billings and tax payments in April. Total bank loans decreased 1% from the preceding quarter to $43
billion, primarily reflecting a modest decline in corporate loans as new origination demand continues to be tepid in
the market.
Moving to slide 6, Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion and
pre-tax income of $411 million. Year-over-year, asset base revenues declined due to market declines. However,
PCG results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees.
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $276 million and a pre-tax loss of $34 million.
Revenues declined 28% compared to the prior-year quarter, mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues,
as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues. The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for
investment banking, has strained the near-term profitability of the segment's results.
As we explained at Analyst and Investor Day, the segment's results are negatively impacted by amortization,
share-based compensation for prior years, as well as growth investments. However, we are focused on managing
controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $89 million on net revenues of $226 million. The
increase in net revenues and pre-tax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets
and fee-based accounts.
The Bank segment generated net revenues of $514 million and pre-tax income of $66 million. Third quarter NIM
for the Bank segment of 3.26% rose 85 basis points over the year-ago quarter, but as expected, decreased 37
basis points from the preceding quarter, primarily due to higher funding cost. We continue to add diverse, higher
cost funding sources and shifted more of the lower-cost suite funding to third party banks. While this negatively
impacted the Bank segment's NIM, Paul Shoukry will walk us through how this benefits both clients and the firm
overall.
Looking at the fiscal year to date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $8.6 billion and record
net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion, up 5% and 22% respectively over the prior year's
records. We aren't seeing many other firms in our industry generate records so far this year. Additionally, we
generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible
common equity of 22.7% for the nine month period.
On slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segments for the first nine months of the year primarily reflects the
benefit of strong organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital and

higher interest-related revenues. When compared to the record activity levels in the year-ago period, weaker
capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage
revenue, despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition.
And now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting on slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $2.91 billion in the third quarter,
up 7% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period
when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diverse and
complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group business, which reached record client assets
this quarter.
Asset management and related administrative fees declined 4% compared to the prior-year quarter and increased
5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee base accounts at the end of the preceding quarter, along with
one additional billable day in the fiscal third quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets grew 5% to a new record,
providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Brokerage revenues of $461 million declined 10% year over year and 7% sequentially. This year over year
decline was largely due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment, as well as
lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG. I'll discuss accountant service fees and net interest income shortly.
Investment banking revenues of $151 million declined 32% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. As experienced
across the industry, both underwriting and M&A revenues, continued to be challenged this quarter. We are
optimistic that the environment is improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and
solid new business activity. However, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timings of deals launching
and closing given the heightened market volatility. So while we may not see significant improvement in the fiscal
fourth quarter, we expect better results over the next 6 to 12 months.
Moving to slide 11, clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at
$58 billion, up 11% over the preceding quarter and representing 5.2% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisors
continued to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. The Enhanced Savings
Program attracted approximately $8.5 billion in new deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming
in to ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisors highlighting the attractiveness of this product and
Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.
The Enhanced Savings Program balances exceeded $11.9 billion this week, continuing to grow modestly and
partially offsetting the decline in sweep balances, largely due to the approximately $1.3 billion of quarterly fee
billings in July. As I said on last quarter's call, it feels like we're closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than
we are to the beginning, and we have certainly seen a deceleration of the activity over the past several months.
However, we are not ready to declare the end of that dynamic. We will need more time with stable balances and
interest rates.
This quarter's sweep balances with third party banks increased $7.5 billion to $16.9 billion, giving us a large
funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface. These third-party balances grew faster than we
expected last quarter as a strong growth of Enhanced Savings Program balances at Raymond James Bank
allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet. While this dynamic has negatively impacted the
5

Bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet,
it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution, while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility.
Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $708 million, up
91% over the prior year quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarter. The sequential decrease in
firm-wide net interest income was partially offset by higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks. If you recall on our
last earnings call, we anticipated a 10% decline in these interest-related revenues, so we are pleased with a
better than expected decline of just 3%, which was partly a function of higher than anticipated growth of
Enhanced Savings Program balances.
The Bank segment's net interest margin decreased 37 basis points sequentially to 3.26% for the quarter, and the
average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 12 basis points to 3.37%. While there are
many variables that will impact the actual results, we currently expect combined net interest income in RJBDP
fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal third quarter,
as we expect some further contraction of the Bank segment net interest income to be partially offset by an
increase in RJBDP fees from third-party banks. As we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing
NIM over the near term, we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income in RJBDP
fees over the long term, which we believe we are well positioned to do.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.85 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.7%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.7% during the quarter,
which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for capital markets.
Non-compensation expenses of $570 million increased 15% sequentially. As Paul mentioned earlier, the quarter
included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and a bank loan
provision for credit losses of $54 million. The $65 million of provisions for legal and regulatory matters was made
up of several items that all hit this quarter. Some of those items were closed out and publicly disclosed and some
of the other items are still in process, and we therefore will not be able to provide much more detail on those in
this call. Additionally, this quarter included seasonally higher conference and event-related expenses.
The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $54 million increased $26 million over the preceding
quarter, largely reflecting weaker assumptions for commercial real estate valuations in the Moody's CRE Price
Index, and in particular, the Office Price Index, which resulted in higher allowances. I'll discuss more related to the
credit quality in the Bank segment shortly.
In summary, while there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory matters over the past two
quarters, none of the other non-compensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we'd expected
when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year. But as you all know, legal and regulatory expenses and
provisions for loan losses using the CECL methodology are inherently difficult to predict. Importantly, we remain
focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors
and their clients.
Slide 14 shows a pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pre-tax
margin of 16.7% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 18.1%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges
impacting capital markets and the aforementioned provisions.

On slide 15, at quarter-end, total assets were $78 billion, a 2% sequential decrease, largely reflecting lower client
cash balances in CIP during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the
parent ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target.
The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.4% and total capital ratio of 22% are both more than double the regulatory
requirements to be well capitalized. The 11.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital
above our conservative 10% target, which would still be two times the regulatory requirement to be well
capitalized.
Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. We
also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility, which was
recently renewed and upsized in April and nearly $10 billion FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the fiscal third quarter, the
firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of nearly $91 per
share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the board's approved common
stock repurchase authorization, and we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases, as we have
discussed previously.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank.
The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment
ended the quarter at just 0.94%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for
investment ended the quarter at just 1.04%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a
percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.9% at the quarter end. We believe this represents an
appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints,
higher interest rates and a potential recession on the corporate loan portfolio.
As we have done from time to time when we believe there's an attractive risk/reward, during the quarter, we
proactively sold approximately $450 million of corporate loans at an average price of around 98% of PAR value.
There continues to be a lot of attention on the commercial real estate across the industry, given the challenge with
property values and interest rates, so let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE
and REIT loans of approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of total loans. Our office portfolio is $1.4
billion, only representing approximately 3% of the Bank segment's total loans. Overall, we have deliberately
limited the exposure to office real estate and we underwrote office loans with what we believed were conservative
criteria. But we will continue to monitor each loan closely given the industry-wide challenges.
Now I will turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first nine months of fiscal
2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a challenging environment. And
while there is still near-term economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well
positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses. And the Private Client Group next
quarter results will be favorably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of asset and fee based account. And I'm

optimistic over the long term we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective
advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and product solutions.
In the Capital Markets segment, there are some signs of improvement in investment banking and we continue to
have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there is reason for optimism, we expect the
pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would more likely pick up over
the next six to 12 months. In the fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit
balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We
hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we could start to see an improvement.
So while there are some near-term challenges over the long term, we believe the Capital Markets business is well
positioned for growth given the investments we've made over the last five years, which have significantly
increased our productive capacity and market share. We will continue to prudently manage expenses in these
businesses as near-term revenues continue to come under pressure. Obviously, we'll have to take more
significant action if the industry headwinds prove to be more long term.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter up
3% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive
throughout the quarter.
We remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee based accounts in the Private Client Group segment
will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James
Investment Management to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and operational and
marketing synergies.
In the Bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with
diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-
based loan payoffs decelerate and expect demand for those loans to eventually recover as clients get comfortable
with the current level of rates.
With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However, we believe the yield environment
has improved. With ample cash sitting with third-party banks and lots of capital, we are well positioned to lend
once activity picks up.
In closing, we have strong prospects for future growth given our strong competitive positioning in all of our
businesses and our ample capital and liquidity. I want to take this time to thank our advisors and associates for
their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day,
especially in these uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most. Thank you all for what you do.
And with that, operator, will you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven
Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, Paul and Paul, it's Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven here. I guess just starting one off on maybe the
balance sheet reinvestment strategy here. You highlighted potentially capitalizing on some of the yield
opportunities in loans down the road, but given improved, the improving sorting picture, the funding capacity you
have on the off balance sheet cash and the fact that we're near peak rates is adding duration to lock in some
higher yield here something that you're considering more actively?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you've known us long enough that we don't play the betting on interest rate games. So, we like a floating
rate balance sheet that served us well, even though maybe for a couple years we got criticized, it made it kind of
easy to get through this last year. And we certainly have some duration in our balance sheet and bank in terms of
mortgages and other things. But again, we're not looking at trying to make an interest rate bet overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And yeah, for my follow-up, maybe switching to the capital markets side. We're hearing a lot
of your peers highlight green shoots as well as a potential recovery in DCM and ECM, but capital raising activity
at Ray-Ja was relatively weaker during the quarter. Is that just a function of the mix or were there other factors at
play? I know you said you expect better results in 2024, but how should we be thinking about the outlook for that
business relative to what your peers have been highlighting? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think we've all been in the same boat. I mean, we've had the mix of our businesses or difference with the
timing of quarters, but we've already had a number of transactions close for this quarter. But we see green shoots
and that both activity level, backlog, new deals, are all positive factors. But we just don't see a big rush to get
everything done.
So, although we expect the business to improve our history and our cycles, just tell us that they take a little longer
than we would all like or a lot of what bankers expected. So I think we're going to all track along in the industry on
this. Hopefully it improves. We'll play along. We're positioned. We have a lot of clients interested, a lot of
mandates. But for them to come – we've had those for the last year. So the question is when are people really
able to transact in the market.
I did want to add something to your first question on banking. Although we don't make duration plays, we are
seeing spreads widen in loans and we think there's an opportunity, again, by keeping our capital in cash that at
the right time and the right loans, we'll be able to grow more on spread than making interest rate bets as a
strategy.

Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. Maybe first question on cash and ESP balances. With now having built back to over $16 billion
of third-party deposits and noting in your prepared remarks that you have adequate liquidity for growing the
balance sheet, do you anticipate taking any steps near term or have you already taken any steps yet to reduce
some of the incentives in place to grow those ESP balances much further from current levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Kyle. No, we really again, the ESP program is a product that we created to serve clients and to help advisors
bring in assets from their clients. And so really what's driving our growth strategy with ESP is first and foremost
client demand, and advisors are asking us to keep this product available for their clients. And of course, there's
some capacity constraints given we offer up to $50 million of FDIC insurance. So there's a network of banks and
there's capacity constraints associated with that. But we're not looking to sort of manage those balances down
based on our near-term needs. Long term, we know, we're confident we'll need the funding. And so this gives us
ample opportunity to grow the balance sheet when client demand for loans resurfaces.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And it's an easy adjustment for us too, because you can adjust rate, which gives you some attrition and you can
stop the program if you had to or slow it down. So, but as of right now, cash sorting has slowed, but it hasn't
stopped. If you look at everyone's reports, we will continue to leave the program open to our advisors as long as
we have capacity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. And then for my follow-up, I was hoping we could dig into SBL demand a little bit. During the Investor
Day, it seemed like you were hopeful that we were nearing a point where SBL demand was starting to come back
and it looks like balances remained flat quarter-on-quarter after a few quarters of declining. So first, just
wondering if you believe those balances have finally troughed.
And then given the recent equity market resurgence here, is that having any incremental impact on kind of clients'
willingness to borrow against securities? So just if you're talking about SBL demand overall and then any leading
indicators, I guess you might be seeing on the SBL demand side. Thank you.

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think we have certainly seen a deceleration of pay downs, which is what really picked up as rates increased and
borrowing cost increased, we saw the expected pay downs over the last six to 12 months. Kind of was particularly
in June and even in July, those pay downs have really slowed down. And so we think this is a good baseline.
We're not smart enough to call a trough or a floor. But we are optimistic that over the next six to 12 months the
markets stay relatively resilient that we'll see kind of a pickup of demand off this level, off these sort of levels
going forward.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks. Hey, Paul, I want to go back to your guidance on cash revenues to down 5% from
this quarter. At the same time, cash balances seem to be stabilizing. As you pointed out, the sorting has been
slowing down. We got another rate hike here today. So I'm just trying to understand the assumptions behind this
guidance. And as part of that, can you give us an update on RJBDP balances at the bank as well as at third-party
banks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So a lot of pieces to that question, Alex. But, hopefully 5% is a conservative guide. You know, last quarter
we guided down 10% and it actually ended up being down 3%. So we were very pleased to outperform our guide
from last quarter. Just given the uncertainty, we think it's always prudent to give conservative guidance around
these type of things. So you're right. There are a lot of puts and takes.
You know, we would expect the BDP fee portion to be up just because balances are up so significantly quarter
over quarter. So as long as that stays somewhat resilient over the course of the quarter, we would expect those
BDP fees to be up. And then conversely, with the interest income at the bank, we would expect pressure there
just because we'll have a full quarter impact of all of the ESP balances that we raised during the third quarter. And
as we raised those balances, we moved the lower cost balances from the bank to the third-party banks.
So there's some geography involved in that from one to the other. But when we put those things together in our
best guess, that balances going forward, which can change dramatically over the next couple of months, that's
where we come up with the down 5% between both BDP fees and NII. But again, we're hoping that we can
exceed that guidance if things hold.
And in terms of what we're seeing so far in the month of July, really the balances have stabilized. I mean, we did
see a decrease in the sweep balances due to the quarterly fee billings in July, which is what you would expect.
But outside of that, we really have seen kind of a sort of absolutely a deceleration of cash sorting activity. I mean,

outside of those declines from the quarterly fee billings cash, the sweep balances were fairly stable outside of
those quarterly fee billings, and the ESP balances continued to grow.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. That makes more sense. Second question to Paul, Paul senior on investment banking I guess. So I hear
your comments around the pipeline is getting better and it sounds like you guys are hopeful that in six to 12
months revenue will sort of come back up here. So are you effectively implying that investment banking revenues
will be in this kind of $150 million-ish range for the next couple of quarters? And then if that's the scenario, is there
room to more aggressively manage the expense base to bring that business to profitability or breakeven even in
that sort of scenario, or you really need to see a much better revenue picture to become profitable in Capital
Markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, actually got us both pretty well there. You're calling me old and Paul young, so. But I think that it's really
hard to tell. If you look at backlog and things, you could say it'll start improving. But I think until the market really
goes, you'll see it with everybody. So I don't know what our position would be that would make it a lot different in
the market when it returns.
So we do have a lot more capacity. We invested a lot of those investments are with people that we recruited and
did acquisitions and they kind of, they're part of us now. So yeah, we've already looked at, we've trimmed some
costs and we think it'll continue longer term. We would do more, but we're really trying to keep the team in place
that we spent five years in building. I think they'll be very, very productive. So hopefully that everyone's green
shoots turns into trees, and it's we're hoping for.
I think Paul gave six to 12 months before we think, industry-wide not just us, it'll really start getting. But that's the
unknown. It really just, it's the unknown. We certainly have the capacity and once the market picks up, I think
we're well positioned. Clients are engaged. But that's the $1 million question we can't answer. But if we ever got
to the point we thought it was more of a permanent or longer term kind of hiatus, we would manage costs as
tightly as we could.

Thanks for taking my question. And I know, Paul, that you – I won't go into junior or senior. Paul, CFO Paul, you
commented that you were limited in what you could say on the legal charges, which is totally understandable, not
all resolved. But now this is the second quarter in a row we've had some legal charges. And is it right to assume
we're probably going to see a third quarter because you said they're not all resolved, and so therefore, should we
expect some bleed into next quarter? How should we think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, there could be certainly additional reserves and there probably will be additional reserves in future
quarters. But we're hoping that there'll be a pretty big drop off from the $66 million or so that we saw this quarter.
That was obviously unusual for us if you look back at our history. So time will tell. But obviously, this quarter was
obviously elevated relative to sort of what you look at for an average reserve quarter for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, fair enough. And then wondering if you could give a little bit of color around the ending of the relationship
with the independent contractor that you spoke about that impacted NNA this quarter. What kind of counterparty
was that and what led to the decision by either them or you to go in a different direction?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're not going to talk about firms or stuff, but I think that just based on our strategy – it was an
independent contractor firm, a normal independent contractor firm – based on their strategy and what they wanted
to do and ours, and us looking at our profitability. And I think what they thought they could do in other things, we
just thought it would be better to have another home and they went ahead and we supported their move. And we
again, as we said, we kept a lot of the advisers and the advisers had a choice. So, I would call it just strategic
differences in both of our businesses and profitability, as we've said, we don't think that there's a negative impact
to our profitability on that change. So we're both making our bets and both going in the directions we think were
right.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Paul, just maybe can you talk a little bit about – can you speak to the maturity profile
of the AFS book? It's still yielding around 2%, a little over 2%. So just great to get your thoughts on how quickly
that portfolio runs off and you get a chance to reinvest that at higher rates?

Yeah. And we, I mean, the average maturity on that portfolio is somewhere in the four year range. And so it takes
some time for it to run off. We're probably going to see a maybe a $1.5 billion or so of a run off a year at current
levels. So it'll take some time. And frankly, we grew that securities portfolio during that COVID period because we
had pretty significant increase in client cash balances, as you'll recall. And there really wasn't demand from third-
party banks, so we took it on to our own balance sheet to accommodate those cash balances. And fortunately, we
kept the vast majority of those, as Paul indicated, in very, very short term treasuries and didn't take too much
duration risk.
And so now, as we look forward, we're really going to grow that or let that securities portfolio run off. So the
liquidity in the balance sheet should be somewhere around 10% of the banks' balance sheets combined, which
will let us reinvest a lot of those repayments to bank loans, which again, as Paul said, have higher spreads and
higher yields on them. So they'll be a nice kind of tailwind for us over the next several years, hopefully.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. And then when you just think about NII after this coming quarter down, I guess combined down 5%, maybe
NII down a little more, how do you think about, do you feel like once you kind of catch up and ESP balances are
not growing as rapidly, that that NIM starts, in the bank starts to stabilize and NIIs can be flat to up or still think
that further declines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And just to be clear, when we raise those ESP balances, cash is fungible. The cash that we move off balance
sheet to third-party banks is still making a higher spread than the costs...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
...of the ESP balances while we sort of await investment in higher yielding assets and loans. So, it's still not a
huge net positive, but it's still a net positive for us. So we offer the clients a product that's attractive, allows
advisors to gain more wallet share from their clients. And, we essentially place that cash with third-party banks
until we have better investment opportunities. There's a lot of geography involved in terms of what shows up in NII
and BDP piece, but we obviously look at it from a consolidated basis.
So it's really a win for the clients, a win for the advisors and a win for the firm, and gives us a lot of capacity to
grow the balance sheet over time. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And to the extent that when
demand returns for loans, both corporate loans and then loans to the Private Client Group clients, then it will
certainly be a nice tailwind to our net interest income.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think if you look industry – if you look industry wide, there's still a competition for cash, as long as there is and an
upward in the Fed's raising rates, it's going to impact, I think, rates on both ends. And until that dynamics – once
that dynamic stabilizes or if it ever does go the other way, which some people predict, we haven't believed the
forward curve for over a year now, but once that does happen, spreads should improve. But that's – we don't
know. So we're operating we know on the ESP balances. They're not cheap, but we still make a spread off of
them. So it's a positive NII and so there's no harm in raising for clients and we make a little money too, so.
Thanks, okay, thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And just to be clear, one last comment on this is because I've got some questions over the email, is our guide, the
5% guide that I provided on NII and BDP fees is really based on today's rate action. So we're not trying to factor in
the forward curve or anything like that. As Paul said, I'm not sure we totally buy the forward curve, but I'm not
sure – we're certainly not going to give guidance based on the Fed cutting rates any time soon.

Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to provide some color on the
marketplace for recruiting advisors today, how you see that evolving and how you might characterize the
pipeline? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, I think I've gotten this question almost every quarter now for 13 years since I've been CEO. It's competitive. I
mean, I think all firms are kind of in the market. The costs have gone up somewhat, certainly over the years. So
we have maintained our position, not being the highest bidder in these cases and using it as positive selection.
But it's certainly competitive. You have the broker-dealer employee channels, you have the independent firms and
the [ph] RAA (51:28) aggregators competing, especially at the high end for all their clients.
So the good news for us is we continue to compete very well. We continue – the pipeline is strong. The biggest
change probably over the last two years is the number of just very large teams that we talk to versus years ago.
So, but the pipeline is great. It's been picking up every quarter, at a slow start and it's continued to pick up each
quarter. And so we're optimistic, but it is competitive.

Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question on the ESP balances. Just curious how you think about the duration
of those ESP deposits versus your sweep deposits and other funding sources? And how do you take that into
consideration when you think about ultimately reinvesting and putting some of those deposits to work?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, well, it's a relatively new product for us. We launched it in March, so we'll learn more as we have more
experience with it and as rates stabilize and those sorts of things. So, we always try to have cushions around kind
of how we think about funding deployment and maybe even more so a bigger cushion when you're dealing with a
new deposit product in a volatile and uncertain rate environment. And so, you look at where we are today, we've
had a target of third-party balances of around $10 billion that we talked about just six months ago and now we're
up to $16 billion, or north of $16 billion of third-party balances. And the banks are still holding very high cash
balances, more than they need in a normal environment. And so we have a significant funding cushion and
opportunity over the next several months to really kind of have better history and understanding of the sort of the
reinvestment of the Enhanced Savings Product balances.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you can also look at most of the ESP balances came from cash balances elsewhere, money markets,
treasuries. I mean, so it was really I think if you look at the assets, a cash yield play, it just happened to be
secured with FDIC and more people viewed it as more secure with FDIC insurance. So it's not like it came out of
everybody ran from equities into the product. And if you look at the percentage of our assets in cash are certainly
not at – we're more closer to historic levels than we are record levels. I mean or so, but as Paul said, we're always
more cautious with the new product and understand it can move and also are used to competing. So we will see
in the quarter. But again, we have a big cushion right now. And that's why we haven't slowed down deposits, just
understanding that it could have a little more volatility, but we'll see.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks so much. Good evening, Paul and Paul. I'll just keep it at one. Most was covered here, but do want
to ask about corporate M&A for the firm. And we obviously saw recent press around a reasonably sized public
independent broker that could be mulling a sale and so I thought that was interesting. And so without getting into
details around where Raymond James might be interested specifically, it would be great just to hear about kind of
what you guys are seeing in the marketplace. Because it would seem that conditions could be getting better for
you guys as well, just with valuations recovering, your stock's up as well, confidence is improving in the
marketplace to some degree, and would just assume that's a little bit of a better environment for M&A. So just
love to talk about what you guys are seeing in the marketplace today, and if you can, what that pipeline of
opportunities is looking like right now relative to, I don't know, a year ago.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, thanks, Devin. As you know, we just hired a new head of our corporate development practice, so we
certainly didn't do that to slow down and I didn't see the article you're alluding to. But we've always have had a
course of firms that we believe would fit us well, especially in the Private Client Group space where we really
know them all and our focus hasn't changed. And as we've said, the problem with most, they're private or not for
sale. So it doesn't help, but we stay close and if it ever changes, we want to be their only or first call. So we
continue to keep that strategy.
And then on the M&A with Suraj, who's joined us, is really focused on also other opportunities. We've looked at
M&A firms that we talked to pre market adjustment. And because we thought valuations were way off and we
continue dialogue with those that we think fill holes in the practice and again pricing has gotten much better there.
We've met a few in the asset management space and some we've talked to and couldn't come up with pricing
versus the market. But that's not unusual for us. And looking at other ancillary technology fit-in plays like
SumRidge, which has really been a huge positive.
So our eye is not off the ball at all for M&A. In fact, we always assume the tougher the market, the better
opportunity to really add people to the family. So again, has to be a culture fit, strategic, be able to integrate it and
then it's price. And so we're pretty price disciplined too. So we're working away and we always have. So but,
where we didn't close any for a while and we closed three quickly. So you know, who knows?
