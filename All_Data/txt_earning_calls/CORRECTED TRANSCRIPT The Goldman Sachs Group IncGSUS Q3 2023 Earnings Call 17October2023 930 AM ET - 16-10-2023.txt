MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Karen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.
On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be
found on the Investor Relations page of our website, and contains information on forward-looking statements and
non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer,
Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us.
Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the Middle East.
We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss
of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region, and it's very
concerning for many of us around the world. We, obviously, will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds.
Earlier this month, I marked the end of my fifth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic
about the firm and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses: our market-leading
Global Banking & Markets franchise; and our growing Asset & Wealth Management platform, both of which are
being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle.
As I reflect on the past five years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the
same: long track record of being a trusted advisor for the world's leading businesses, institutions, and individuals;
a global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies, and solutions; an
aspirational brand; exceptional people; and a culture of collaboration and excellence.
Additionally, over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs
operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice, and execution capabilities has
strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today, our client
franchise is as strong as ever, enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions
for our clients.
For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day, there have been four marquee IPOs priced
in the United States: Arm Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and Birkenstock. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of
those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to
help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires longstanding client relationships, deep
market expertise, and experience.
Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospect of a wider reopening of capital
markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect a continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic

activity. As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity could be a tailwind for
Goldman Sachs.
In Asset & Wealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our
franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years, we posted
our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We generated record management and other fees of
$2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024. We are also ahead of pace
on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees.
While our market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have
work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus,
and we have made significant progress on these priorities. Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky.
We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer, sold substantially all of our Marcus
loans portfolio. We've reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the
work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond.
As I assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected. Those are
reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75
basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above
estimates, driving market expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in
the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening of
financial conditions we've seen over the last quarter.
At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe [indiscernible] (00:05:36)
war in Ukraine, ongoing tensions with China, and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are
more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact
economic growth and stability in the US and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.
Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on
it. We, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial
system. There are some who have recently said, we need to address the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis
which is driving the need for much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far
and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and
other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital outlays over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of
capital, increased liquidity, simplified businesses, and have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests.
Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences.
I believe if these rules are implemented three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses
of all size, from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated
shadow banking sector, policies that incentivize the transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could in
fact increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and
the most liquid in the world, they're the engine of our economy, has access to capital, allows for innovation and
growth across the country. Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted
by this proposal.
The net result of these proposed rules will be slower economic growth in the US, [ph] material improvement and
the (00:07:38) soundness of the banking system. We, alongside clients and others in the industry have been

engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that
there will be ongoing debate and ultimately changes to the proposed rules.
Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risk remain top of mind, I feel very confident about the state of our
client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our
strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth
Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business and we remain firmly
committed to delivering for clients and shareholders.
I will now turn it over to Denis to cover financial results for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we
generated net revenues of $11.8 billion, net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in [ph] EPS of $5.47 (00:08:38) and
a return on equity of 7.1%.
As David highlighted, earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong
progress across a number of activities. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the
selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE
by 3.1 percentage points.
These items include: results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & Wealth Management,
including the net impact of marks, sell downs and CIE impairments; as well as results relating to GreenSky, which
includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally, we highlight modest
ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business.
Turning to performance by segment starting on page 4. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8
billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior-year period amid
lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million though industry volumes
remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose
versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date, we ranked number 1 in the league tables across announced
and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting, and ranked number 2 in high-yield debt.
Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions
are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well-positioned
to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets.
FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from a strong performance last year, particularly in
currencies and commodities, and up relative to the second quarter. We produced record FICC financing revenues
of $730 million, which rose sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally,
we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, holding just over $15
billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September.
As we spoke about at our Investor Day, alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us. And the
purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, so we can serve even more
holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at
attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-
over-year on better performance and derivatives, while Equities financing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower
versus a record [ph] second quarter (00:11:34).
[ph] Overall (00:11:35) financing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly [ph] $6 billion (00:11:39) for the
year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our financing results combined
with the substantial share gains we've made since our first Investor Day are the direct result of the successful
execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. We are raising the floor in Global Banking & Markets
as reflected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across investment banking.
Now moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year,
primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-
year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and
lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset
by our sale of substantially all the Marcus loan portfolio.
We remain were very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other
fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period.
Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real
estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results from Marcus loans
negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date.
Now moving to page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. We saw $11 billion of
liquidity inflows and $7 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-
based inflows.
Turning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $542
million of management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party [ph] alternatives (00:13:39) fundraising
was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of
Goldman Sachs Vintage fund IX (sic) [Vintage IX fund] in the third quarter, our largest private equity secondaries
fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020
Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule.
On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related
to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion,
bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. We are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical
principal investment portfolio below $15 billion.
Next, Platform Solutions, page 8. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related
to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by $637 million associated reserve release as we move
the portfolio to held-for-sale.
On page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, down sequentially as increased
funding costs supported training activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $178 billion, flat with the
prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card
lending portfolio, offset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky. Additionally, within our wholesale

portfolio, impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the
macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter.
On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter. CRE loans continue to
represent a relatively small percent of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversified across
geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet
alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have more marked or impaired office-
related exposures by approximately 50% this year.
Now turning to expenses on page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date
compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance
costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be
achieved in 2023 and 2024, and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efficiencies allow us to
reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive.
Quarterly non-compensation expense [ph] was $4.9 billion (00:16:39). The year-over-year increase in non-comp
expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE
impairments of $358 million. While one-time expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to
focus on bringing down non-comp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efficiency goal.
Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, higher versus the first half due to the write-off
of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year, we expect a
tax rate of under 23%.
Now onto slide 12. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the
standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter, we
returned $2.4 billion to shareholders including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock
dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth
quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our shareholders a
sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield.
In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of
our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are
confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic
about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions]
We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks so much. I guess, just big picture, if we add backlog significant items in the quarter, we're obviously
still well short of the mid-teens target. I know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and
you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuff.
So I wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because, in the back of our minds, we also
have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator. So I wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how
much comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity, how much is yet to be freed up capital
from the denominator. I know it's tough, but I wanted to say high level [indiscernible] (00:19:51) thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Glenn, and appreciate the question. And so we'll keep it high level. And let's separate into what we got and
then we can have a separate discussion about Basel III.
But, first, we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overall majority of the
firm to be in two core businesses: our Global Banking & Markets franchise, which is performing very well in an
environment that's not a great environment for that business. Investment banking activities are well below 10-year
norms. I don't think that will stay that way. But if you look at the performance of the business through nine months,
that business, which is kind of 70% of the firm – two-thirds to 70% of the firm, that business is operating with a
13.4% ROE in an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business.
I can't tell you when the environment will get better, but I do believe that the capital markets and banking
environment will improve in the coming years. History tells us that it doesn't stay short – it doesn't stay closed for
multiple years at a time. There is an adjustment. We're making the adjustment. Yes, the world's uncertain. As we
mentioned, that could be a headwind. But I do think it will improve and that business performs well. And we firmly
believe that that business is a mid-teens through-the-cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet
shares, the way we've grown our financing footprint, which adds more balance to the business, and with our
market-leading franchises across that business.
Second, we have the Asset & Wealth Management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as
we reduce the historical principal investments and make it a lower capital [audio gap] (00:21:39) business.
We're on that journey. I think you see us making progress. We've talked about how we reduced the historical
principal investments by $9 billion this year. We set a target for $15 billion by next year, which we'll meet, and
then close to zero two years later. And so that business, we have a high degree of confidence, will operate at mid-
teens or higher as we reposition it.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
As we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. We're narrowing the platforms and reducing the
drag. And we're relatively confident that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in
that. So you add that up with what we have, and I think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target.
Now, the Basel rules. The Basel rules if they were implemented as their positioned now would be a headwind to
that. But, also, that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass-through pricing [indiscernible]
(00:22:35). I'm not saying it won't be a headwind, but I don't want to speculate on what it would do to our target
until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately
manage it.
So we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders.
And when there's more clarity on Basel, we're committed to giving you clear picture of that view. But I wouldn't
jump to a conclusion on it at this point. I'm not saying you are. I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I appreciate that. One quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. You mentioned a number of sectors that
have yet to absorb the higher rates. I'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how
meaningful that is. I'm thinking from more of a big picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Glenn, as I listen to you play it back, what I'd say, US economy has been more resilient. The fiscal stimulus
has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. I'm still of the belief that there's
been a lag with this tightening, and across a broad swath of the economy, we will see more sluggishness.
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession. And certainly, there is a good debate on where this
all lands. But we, again, in the past quarter, materially tightened economic conditions. And I just think there's a lag
in most sectors of the economy, not all, but most sectors of the economy. And I do think, over the next two to four
quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas.
I am hearing, as I interact with CEOs, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the
last eight weeks, in consumer behaviors. I don't want to over-amplify that because I think the economy and the
consumer has been more resilient. But I think that [indiscernible] (00:24:48) watching closely.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. I guess maybe just one first follow up, Denis. I just want to make sure I heard you correct. Did you
say you marked your CRE exposure by 50% in CRE office?
9


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(GS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
And on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond office CRE. Clearly, it's a very manageable issue for
you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. How much more do we have to go before this
is kind of pinned down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, yes, to clarify for our [ph] CRE and CIE (00:25:39) exposure in the office space, we've either marked or
impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year. So I think that's quite significant. We started the year
with about $15 billion of CRE alternative investments. That's been reduced now by about $5 billion. Three
quarters of that was either through pay-downs or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. So
we're making very, very significant progress against those exposures.
If you were to look at the same set of exposures in [ph] non-office (00:26:15), the adjustment there through marks
or impairment is about 15% year-to-date. So we feel we reduced a lot of notional. We appropriately reflected the
valuations in those positions. But, as indicated by our target, we intend to continue to move down those
exposures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess just a separate question. I think the capital markets environment it is what it is. When you look
at the firm over the next year or two, if maybe, David, where do you see the best growth opportunities? One,
maybe talk about the client franchise in capital markets, financing. Is that getting better or worse?
And then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. You've talked about credit being an opportunity.
Just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, on our Global Banking & Markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on
execution to continue to grow our wallet share. We expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150
accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or
three as opposed to just top three. And so we still do see some wallet share opportunities, but we obviously have
very strong wallet share, so that's not most significant.
We are growing our financing [audio gap] (00:27:37) for our Global Banking & Markets franchise. And we expect
to continue to grow that financing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward
growing that financing footprint. And we do think that it has reasonable returns. And it also creates a virtuous
cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a significant financer [ph] with
them (00:27:59).
When you turn to Asset & Wealth Management, I think we've been very clear at our Investor Day, and Marc
stated this, we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high-single digits. That is driven by our
continued growth in management fees over time and a continued growth in the wealth management sector where
we are experiencing good growth and we still see good opportunities in wealth management to grow the franchise
all over the world. And we've made continued good progress on that journey.

When you talk about private credit, we have, as you know, over $100 billion of private credit. We've launched
private credit [ph] vehicles (00:28:36). We obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at Global
Banking & Markets. And what we do with financing, which we think can also be an Asset & Wealth Management
opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit
as a part of the overall growth of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise. Those are a handful of things I'd
highlight at this point.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning. Just another one on Basel III endgame. Appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that,
but now that you had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it affects the
competitiveness of the markets businesses? Are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted?
And then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Christian. I appreciate it. I'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all fluid. But, obviously, if
these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an effect on the businesses, but it's different
from business to business. There are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end-users whether they're
corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you pass on cost. A corporation that wants to hedge and
comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative, I can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't
still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher. Obviously, [ph] with some balance (00:30:26), they would
think about that differently.
There are certain businesses that we might reduce our activity level because, with the new capital rules, the
returns don't look attractive. But there are others and the one I'd point to that's most obvious, which, by the way, a
significant part of the impact to us would be is prime. Okay? There aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in
the prime business. There are very few in Europe, a little bit. And obviously, the Europeans, if this was
implemented this way, would have an advantage. But, at the end of the day, there are a handful of scaled players,
there are lots of scaled institutions that need that service.
Our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way. We'd have to look at the final
rules; we'd have to adjust. So it will affect behavior, it will affect pricing, it will affect optimization, but I know
everybody wants to jump to the clear answer. I think you need to see the rules and then institutions and end users
need to adapt to the new reality, whatever it is. And it's not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry,
[ph] there's obviously the process of (00:31:38) working through that as we have in the past.

economics work for Goldman in the current state? Or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that
partnership?
And then the second question is more on the credit quality in [ph] your senior (00:32:08) credit cards? Kind of
what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? How does it compare to your expectations and the
broader sort of credit card industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Right. I'll start on the first part. Denis will make some comments on credit in the portfolio. First, I think you know,
we hired a gentleman named Bill Johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better
optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. As we've stated to you a number of times, and I'll
repeat it here very clearly, we've worked to narrow our focus. You've seen us execute around Marcus loans and
GreenSky. Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to
exit those partnerships.
So our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag, and bringing them to profitability,
and we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. And
Bill Johnson joining is helping with all that. We'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our
partners and examine what's best in the long run for Goldman Sachs. But our core focus is on reducing the drag
over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, and ensuring we operate them better.
Denis, you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. What I'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. A couple of
things to bear in mind. In consumer, the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last
quarter, and the total dollar amount of charge-offs down as well. You'll also see that our coverage ratio now
stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level given our expectations for the portfolio.
That adjustment is basically a function of GreenSky being removed from that ratio and so now that applies to the
cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now. On the overall performance of credit on the
forward, we'll continue to be focused. We made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll
continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
...you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. Was hoping you could
just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efficiency goal, maybe more specifically, given changes in
revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightening competition you cited, how that's
going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So we continue to be committed to the 60% efficiency ratio. But, as you know, we're moving through –
we're narrowing our focus. We're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on,
Steve, and highlight for you. I'm going to turn to Denis to make sure that we get the number right. But ex those
one-off items, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
About [ph] 64.6% (00:35:35).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Okay. So, putting in perspective, because I think it's important to highlight, that we don't think the things that we're
highlighting continue in perpetuity. We're trying to narrow the focus. And when we look at our Global Banking &
Markets business and our Asset & Wealth Management platform, we think we have the right target.
Now, back to your point, Steve, about competition, the competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains
very, very strong. And so we think we've got a very, very good talent ecosystem. I feel good about the hiring we're
doing. I just highlight that for our analyst [ph] jobs out of (00:36:11) university, we had 260,000 applications for
approximately 2,600 jobs. There were over 1 million applications for employment at Goldman Sachs last year;
very, very aspirational, desirous place to work. But the competition for talent remains high, and so we'll strike the
right balance in making an investment in our talent.
You heard Denis [ph] talk about (00:36:34) some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to
make a reinvestment in [ph] some of the best (00:36:40) talent. We feel good about where we are. But we also
believe that, as we continue to execute on our strategy, which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our
two core businesses of Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management that the efficiency ratio target
that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great color. And just for my follow up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. [ph] Alt (00:37:08)
fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip, but PE is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the LP denominator
effect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. I was hoping you could speak to the broader
outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor banking activity as well as the
alternative asset management business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So that broadly defines [ph] the sponsor (00:37:39) community, Steven, which really is the broad
alternatives world, private capital world. The first thing I'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very,
very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. I think there's some very, very interest in
macro dynamic. I believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20
years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to
charitable foundations; by the way, charitable foundations who also invest. So there's a very, very strong dynamic
of good flows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets, into private asset classes. And so we
believe that's firmly intact.
There's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. I would say it was
extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021; and very, very robust in an environment where monetary policy was
incredibly accommodative. But there's no question that all this investing can be successful as new vintages and a
new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher. The one thing I know
about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns
an enormous portfolio of businesses and they also make money when they buy new assets.
They obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now. And what I'd say
is, for the last six quarters, the last year and a half, that community has been very quiet. In our dialogue, they are
starting to see more interesting opportunities. And I would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity
in the sponsor community will increase again both in terms of sales, that's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic
on capital markets and our advisory activity [audio gap] (00:39:39) look forward over the course of the next four to
eight quarters, but also in terms of new purchases.
I'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. That would not be the normal. But if you look at kind
of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity the sponsor activity would make
up, I would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. And at the moment, we're well below those
averages at the current point in time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my question. I'd love to start on expenses and comp. And
David, you just spoke a little to this when answering Steven's question. But the comp ratio – we saw revenue
growth broadly quarter-over-quarter, and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for Goldman.
Denis, I know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. Was some of that in
the third quarter? Was there unusual items impacting the comp ratio or was this mostly just because of the
competition for talent? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, in terms of third quarter, it was very, very small. We previously disclosed $260 million of severance. It was a
small amount of severance in the quarter. We just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so
you can track that over the course of the year. That obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of [ph] what
(00:41:23) we're thinking for the full year. And we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter
based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people.
And we're looking [ph] at the entire composition for this (00:41:37) being mindful that we continue to pay for
performance but also recognizing, in particular across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in
Global Banking & Markets, record year-to-date financing activity, record management fees year-to-date, record
private banking and lending activities year-to-date, and these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable
future. And we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those
businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that, Denis. And then, when you're thinking about – thanks for all the color on the CRE and the
exposures. When you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you are intending to continue to
sell by the end of next year, what portion of those are CRE or CRE-related? Is it possible to give any color around
the assets that you're going to sell, and how exposed they're to CRE or other sectors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, I made a comment earlier, if you look at aggregate CRE-related on-balance sheet investments and you
look across asset classes, like loans and debt securities, equity securities, and the remaining exposure of equity
in our CIE portfolio, that in aggregate now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion, and down already $5
billion year-to-date. There are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firm-wide activities, our CRA
obligations, and some co-invest exposures. If you look at the – in aggregate, about 43% of the CRE on-balance
sheet investments is [ph] HPI (00:43:25) and that's what we are looking to sell down over time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. The pivot is not new. It's been advertised. I guess, what's new is the actual losses. So, looking back, who is
accountable and who pays the price for the losses with GreenSky, the Marcus loans, and the consumer
expansion strategy that was wider than you wanted to be now? And then, looking ahead, once you eliminate what
you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments, how much would that alone improve
ROE? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hi. Thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. The leadership of the firm, which includes myself and the other senior
leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and
for our people. So, obviously, we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make.
I've said publicly before that I'm happy that we pivoted. As you said, the pivot is not new. We've made the pivot.
We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight, you will do certain things differently. We obviously
reflect. We learn from the things that we do. But I think it's important for companies to try things for companies to
learn and adapt. When you make a decision that you think's the wrong decision for shareholders and the firm, you
adjust accordingly. So, we're doing that and we're moving forward.
The second part of the question was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
How much does ROE improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining
consumer businesses you want to get rid of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think, we've given you a bunch of transparency, Mike, just by looking at this. But if you look at what created
a drag to ROE this quarter, 75% of the drag to ROE this quarter were the impairments and [indiscernible]
(00:45:38) historical principal investments. And if you look over the last few quarters, the most significant impact
on ROE performance has been the historical principal investments. Now, also there were benefits in most
historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that. We think it's a
better business to release that capital and we're on a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're
driving that.
I think, earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the Banking & Markets business,
you can see the Banking & Markets ROE right now, and also the forward ROE of the Asset & Wealth
Management business with less capital on it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12
to 24 months, it'll get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated, and so that will give you a cleaner ROE. We continue to
believe, it can be mid-teens through the cycle.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
And then, what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks in Basel III, of course, but to the extent that you're
discarding off the principal investments that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or
reinvestment elsewhere? Kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think, Denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've built a pretty big cushion and buffer, given
that we successfully reduced our SCB based on actions we're taking. We think that under the stress test that we
continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more benefit to SCB. Now, obviously, Basel is out there
and it's uncertain, so we're at the moment operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've
highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity. But we
will continue to buy back stocks, we will continue to pay our dividend, and as we have clarity under this strategy,
there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately benefit to further buyback. But at the
moment, we'd like – we're going to be a little bit more cautious [ph] and have (00:47:40) a little bit more clarity
around the capital rules before we plow ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets,
maybe asked another way. So, trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. Industry wallet in both fixed income
and equity is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels and you've been taking share. But looking forward, is there
any scenario related to Basel Endgame, where we see industry wallet size shrink, and as you think about higher-
for-longer rates, how do you expect that that impacts the various trading businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Look, I think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world
continues. The growth in the government [indiscernible] (00:48:38) continues. The market capital world continues
to grow and expand. I can't and I won't speculate on exactly where the final Basel rules windup and how everyone
optimizes through all that. But I don't think anything is changing in intermediation, and the need to finance the
positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing.
And so, I continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprints [ph] and are in a (00:49:08)
leading position in these markets businesses, I think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. Of
course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses, but I think the businesses will continue to perform very,
very well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Thank you. Good morning, David and Denis. Want to come back to Wealth Management. I know that the sale of
Personal Financial Management is a small business. But just if you can remind us, how and where you want to
compete in Wealth Management moving forward. And David, maybe give a little more color on some of those
growth opportunities you alluded to that you're seeing there across the globe. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, I appreciate that question, Devin. Our focus is on ultrahigh net worth management, where we have a
leading franchise. I just highlight that ultrahigh net worth management, high net worth – Wealth Management is
still a very fragmented business. And while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid-single-
digit share and we have less share than that in places like Europe and around the world. We've seen really good
growth in Europe. We see continued growth in the US. We have an ability as we put more resources on the
ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business. We've seen very good
growth over the last five years. We think we have meaningful run rate room to do that.
One of the decisions we made, and again this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned, is by selling United Capital
and selling PFM, which was a small business as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the
investment we might have geared toward growing that, and add it to our investment in ultrahigh net worth growth.
And we think that's a better returning business and something we're very confident that we can continue to
execute on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. And then, just quick follow-up. So, the $15 billion capital call facilities with Signature Bank, it
sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers, and you framed out, obviously,
why such an important customer base for Goldman Sachs. So, if you can, maybe just give a little flavor for how
that's going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsors, just given how
important they are as a customer for Wall Street. Whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top
three or where you can go from three to number one, or just any flavor for where your market share opportunities
exist there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. We have – in traditional investment banking services we have leading share with sponsors across M&A and
leverage finance. These capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business, and while we've been in
the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us.
One of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us
where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity, and it gives us an attachment to
them. So, this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we were in meaningfully. Again, and I made this
comment when we were talking about the Global Banking & Markets business, financing your clients strengthens
your overall position with them, because the financing is important to them. And so, as we continue to finance
sponsors, I think it strengthens an already very strong position with the sponsor community.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Platform Solutions. So, for the quarter, if we exclude the write-down,
is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? And as you think about achieving your target of profitability in this
business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? And then, if you could also just
give an outlook for transaction banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you for the question. I don't think it's the right run rate. I think there's a combination of things that we
expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients, as well as ongoing
efficiency with respect to expenses. So, I think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis.
I think on transaction banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a
higher quality client business over the long-term. We had grown quickly. We are now focused on growing with
high quality clients, high quality deposits. As you know, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly
sequentially, I think reasonably in line with the industry, given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity
sets. But we did grow our client count. We remain committed to the business, and we think that it works very well
with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value-unlock over the
longer-term for Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. And as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives in the fundraising that the private equity
challenges, but maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're
in the market with today. And then also, as you think of the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives,
how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward, and when should we start to see
those become a material component of the overall revenue profile?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, on the alternative space, our fundraising activity, $15 billion in the quarter, $40 billion year-to-date, has been
broad-based. We have a broad-based platform. We have mentioned the secondaries fund. David covered some
of the private credit spaces. These are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. They're particularly
relevant. We expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly. Incentive
fees come through, as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start [ph] distributing carry (00:55:39).
So, incentive fees will be lumpy. They will depend on the performance of different funds, but we expect that there
will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. When we laid out at Investor Day, the building blocks for our
19

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
performance in the segment, we put on the page not only the top line target information that David covered
earlier, but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. So, I think that's a source of upside for us.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David, in the past, you – and you talked about the IPOs,
the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter. But in the past, you talked about green shoots and part
of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they
wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations, they are far below where they were in
2021 at the peak of the cycle. Are you finding those conversations easier today or are you finding more people
are recognizing that's correct, and if they want to go public, they just have to accept it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think, absolutely, they're easier. And if you look at a handful of
the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the
valuation now. But I don't think those discussions are difficult. I think those discussions have a real sense of
realism in them and I think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused
on what they have to do to advance themselves strategically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
And Gerard, I'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have [ph] numerous (00:57:36) real data points [ph] in
market (00:57:38), both [ph] those space (00:57:39) for equities and across the leveraged finance space. So, the
conversations that we're having with our clients now, who are looking to access the markets, they're informed by
our leading role and insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. And so, I
think that is an incremental source of our optimism, that we have those data points and that insight to share with
clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market, what types of terms and pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, it's not a big line item, obviously, for you folks. But can you share
with us some of the color in the transaction banking area? That was, obviously, a new business line that you guys
created, just how is it going? I saw the revenues were down slightly, I think sequentially, but what's going on in
that line of business, and again I get it, it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. No. Thanks, Gerard. Our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus. The revenues and the
deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those things are linked. We have grown our

Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. The floor is yours.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on Platform Solutions. I think, Denis, you
mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. But even this quarter, if I
adjust for the loan markdown and the impairments, it seems like you are – if my math is correct, you are PPNR
positive.
Obviously, credit costs are high as the credit card book is seasoning and you are still growing that portfolio. But if
you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting
back to or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say, 24 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Saul. So, just a couple things on glide path to help with the question and the context. So, rate of
growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very, very quickly, and obviously, taking provisions
in line with CECL. We expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further, and that
has some positive impacts.
And then, as David mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional, and we're
working very, very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. We remain in discussions with our
card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for
Goldman Sachs. I think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with how we
manage the expense and the operating efficiency.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe a quick follow-up there. I think you mentioned that NCOs, net charge-offs,
are down this quarter. Is that – and you do have a 13.3% reserve coverage, it does seem like you're maybe closer
to a scenario where provisioning could come down quite a bit, especially under CECL. So, maybe just give us a
sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. And is my assessment right that your reserving could –
especially, if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, you have a couple of facts that are right. We did have a charge-off ratio that was down sequentially quarter-
over-quarter from 5.8% to 5.1%, and lower charge-offs. We are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path
for credit in the consumer portfolio. It's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages
in which we've originated those exposures. We do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3% is appropriate and we,
obviously, set that based on our expected life of loan losses. So, as we move forward, our expectation is we'll
continue to see elevated charge-offs. And as you look at our reporting on that, with GreenSky pulled out of the

consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform and we do expect that will show elevated
charge-offs.

Great. Thank you.

Operator: For our next question, we'll return to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just a clarification on my prior question. So, if I have this right, you reduced your PE investments by $3 billion
quarter-over-quarter, and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the Asset Management &
Wealth segment. I mean, is that completely correlated? So, if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal
investments, does that free up say $16 billion, is that ballpark right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
No. Mike, I think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time we
gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. So, I don't think – I'd be happy to get
on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but I don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the
forward, significantly less than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, how much do you have left then? Once you describe the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be
freed up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to
give you a sense. So, we probably have remaining mid-single-digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be
excluded when we think about our models?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. We do think of them as more one-
time in nature. We, as you know, did a head count reduction earlier in this year. That's not our current expectation
to repeat that. If anything, we think that the work we've done to rightsize the firm is something that puts us in a
position to now make more selective investments in our head count on the forward. So, we don't expect that type
of severance to repeat itself and we are taking into account as we said the compensation ratio, that severance
