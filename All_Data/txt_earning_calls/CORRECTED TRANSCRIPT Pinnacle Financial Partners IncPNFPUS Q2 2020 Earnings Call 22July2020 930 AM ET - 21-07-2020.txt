With that, I'm now going to turn the presentation over to Mr. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and CEO.

M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Jimmy. At the conclusion of our Q1 conference call, I tried to provide some guidance for what our
focus would be going forward. I indicated that we continue to manage those things that produce long-term
shareholder value, but would remain in a more defensive posture until we can see more, clearly, the depth and
duration of the pandemic and its impacts.
Specifically, I indicated that we have increased liquidity in Q1 and we continue to do so in Q2, which we did.
However, we are reviewing details of substantial liquidity build from both, wholesale and client funding, all
obtained simply out of an abundance of caution, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.
I indicated that you should expect us to continue building loan loss reserves in Q2 which we did, not to the extent
we did in the first quarter but still a meaningful increase. Our allowance has moved from 0.48% at year-end, now
to 1.27% at June 30 and excluding our PPP loans, the allowance would be 1.41%.
In regards to capital, I indicated that while we did not intend to cut our dividend at this time, we were still in a
mode to increase capital, which we did. Beyond suspending our share buyback and retaining the sub-debt we had
previously intended to redeem, we sold preferred shares totaling approximately $225 million, increasing or
topping off Tier 1 capital.
I also indicated that for the first time since the Great Recession, we were slow on our planned levels of
recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense build that goes with it which we've done. Our non-interest
expense to asset ratio, as we adjusted, was 1.54% which is the lowest I can recall in the history of the firm.
As I mentioned last quarter, it's inconceivable to me that in the final analysis, 2020 will have been about what our
earnings were in 2020. More likely, it will ultimately be about how nimble we were in a relatively changing
environment and how well will be our run rates for earnings in 2021. And so, while we're taking these major steps
to bolster capital and liquidity and we're scouring our loan book, we're slowing the recruitment to avoid the
expense build. It's really our intent to execute on the fundamentals that we control and loans that produce long-
term shareholder value like lowering cost of funds, obtaining floors on loans and the various core deposit
initiatives that we have launched in order to better position ourselves for a return to more normal run rate as we
go into 2021.
Looking at those fundamentals that typically produce long-term shareholder value, Q2 was an outstanding
quarter. Loans and deposits were up meaningfully, largely owing to PPP. We saw an improvement in virtually all
of our primary asset quality metrics although we recognized many of our lagging indicators. We made substantial
headway, lowering our cost of deposits and obtaining rate floors on loans. And we saw linked-quarter growth in
revenue, pre-provision net revenues, spread income and fee income.
As always, we will review our standard dashboard to key success measures for our firm. I'll start with the GAAP
measures for the quarter, but moving quickly to the non-GAAP measures, because, honestly, for the most part,
these are what we manage to. Total revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year and 14.7% linked-quarter. Of course,
as we adjusted, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.89, primarily impacted by the elevated provision. Harold
will review that in detail in just a few minutes.

And next to the EPS chart, you can see core pre-provision, net revenue was up 15% linked-quarter and roughly
3% year-over-year, a really important measure when considering our ability to build the 2020 run rates as I just
mentioned earlier. Loan and deposit volumes were up meaningfully during the quarter. In the case of core
deposits, it was our largest growth quarter ever, no doubt PPP had a major impact on that, but when we dig in, we
found that our PPP borrowers' deposit balances grew roughly $1.7 billion during the quarter, which means absent
that impact, our core deposits grew north of $1 billion, the largest quarterly organic growth in core deposits ever.
As you recall, we've placed considerable internal emphasis on core deposit acquisition going back into 2019 and
modifying our 2020 incentives, which I believe is also having an impact at this time.
Of course, loans grew up dramatically in the second quarter, all-in-all almost exclusively to PPP. I think there were
at least two matters to note. The first is I'd expect pure economic loan demand amongst small and mid-market
businesses outside of PPP in the second quarter would have been near zero. Secondly, in our case specifically,
we saw meaningful paydowns in commercialized credit after draws had swelled in the previous quarter, likely
indicating less requirement for businesses to finance working assets and less urgent needs to build and hold
liquidity. After that line paydown phenomenon, loan growth would have been better than budgeted for us in the
second quarter.
Asset quality was strong, even after the significant re-risk rating effort during the quarter. Both NPAs and
classified assets moved lower, and net charge-offs were just 10 basis points. Tim Huestis will review all of that in
greater detail shortly. So, that's a 30,000-foot summary of the quarter, our growing balance sheet largely aided by
PPP, strong revenue growth, well-managed expenses and solid asset quality metrics.
Let me turn it over to Harold to provide a little more color commentary on the quarter before Tim Huestis digs into
the loan book and the loan portfolio review process we undertook during the quarter.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to talk more about PPP this quarter. I think it's important
so you can better understand how we believe our second quarter results were impacted. Excluding PPP from our
EOP balances results in a $99 million reduction in our loans for the quarter. As Terry mentioned, in the last
quarter, we had about $250 million in commercial line draw increases. This quarter line draws were down by $380
million. Line draws were at 50.7%, which is the lowest I can remember in recent memory.
Loans are coming in at a slower pace, but there are opportunities. We still believe based on discussions with our
market leaders and commercial lenders that annualized loan growth will land in the low-to-mid single digits for this
year, of course, after excluding the impact of PPP. After looking forward, we're not anticipating any reduction in
PPP loan balances in the third quarter. That may be conservative, but we don't have good forgiveness rules yet.
So, that's the decision we've made for the third quarter. The SBA told Congress that they hope to have their
forgiveness portal up and running by August. We'll just have to see.
Average balances for PPP loans was $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our third quarter forecast for average
PPP loans is slightly more than $2.2 billion. Our yield on PPP loans was 2.89% in the second quarter, so third
quarter should be fairly consistent based on our note paydown assumptions. We're forecasting principal
reductions in PPP loans in the fourth quarter. Our internal forecast anticipate that 13% of our $72 million in PPP
fees will amortize into income in the third quarter, and then 37% in the fourth quarter, given our guess that we will
likely get meaningful PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
As for deposits, as Terry mentioned, there was a huge deposit quarter for us. End-of-period deposits were up
almost 26%, while core deposits were up 15% over March 31, significant growth in noninterest-bearing deposits
ending at $6.9 billion. There's a chart in the supplemental information that characterizes the second quarter
growth for loans and deposits.
We're estimating that the PPP program provided about $1.7 billion of our deposit growth for the quarter. This is a
rough estimate because it's practically impossible to determine a precise number. That number is simply the net
growth in PPP borrowers' deposits between March 31 and June 30. We do anticipate that a meaningful amount of
these deposits will move off of our balance sheet over the next few quarters as the PPP borrowers use those
funds.
So rest of the same quarter growth was split, $1 billion in client growth and $1.4 billion in wholesale deposits.
Wholesale deposits were acquired as part of our decision to amp up our liquidity as a result of COVID. In all
likelihood, we'll see some of these wholesale deposits decrease in the third and fourth quarters, so we intend to
let our liquidity return to more traditional levels over the next 12 months. This is all contingent on COVID and,
obviously, progress toward a vaccine.
Next is the usual update for our loan pricing. Given the circumstances, very pleased with how loan spreads have
held up when you consider the 30-day LIBOR averaged about 1.4% in the first quarter, and that fell to 35 basis
points in the same quarter and will likely be 15 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. Our relationship managers
are working with borrowers to increase LIBOR spreads and are finding success. As noted on the slide, our
second quarter LIBOR rates for new loans were at 3.15% compared to 2.85% for the entire LIBOR portfolio.
Prime-based credit is hanging tough, basically trying to keep a fore handle on these credits, getting more and
more successful in achieving loan floors on the prime and LIBOR book, so we're excited to see that occurring,
more on that in a minute.
Fixed rate lending is also hanging tough. We're giving us some yield on new fixed rate loans as new loans come
in at around 4% in the second quarter with the total fixed rate book yielding around 4.35%. Forecasting loan yields
in this environment is pretty difficult right now, given the uncertainty around PPP loans. We should experience
some loan yield contraction in the third quarter given the impact of PPP and where LIBOR is hovering.
Offsetting these two items for us, will be the success we're having in loan books. At June 30, we had $2.7 billion
shorter-term variable rate credit with a loan floor and that number is up from $2.1 billion at March 31. We also
have $800 million in shorter-term variable rate credit that comes up further between now and year-end 2020 that
doesn't have a loan floor yet.
One of the big opportunities we have as we work our way through 2020 is to build loan floors into our prime and
LIBOR loan books, doing that will obviously help us as we ramp into 2021 in this lower for longer flatter yield
curve.
I'm not going to spend a great deal of time discussing deposit pricing. This is obviously not a new chart and it
seems like deposit betas or so last year. That said the other big thing we can do as we focus on building around
into 2021 is managing our deposit in total funding costs. We see no reason we should not be targeting a range of
less than 25 basis points to 30 basis points for deposit cost by year-end.

Our relationship managers have their client list and are working with them, aimed at depositors who have higher
deposit pricing. We have approximately $1 billion in CD renewals in the second half of the year, and we will be
gradually reducing our wholesale funding balances, both of which will serve to reduce funding costs.
Now, we're bringing this information forward from last quarter. I'm not going to spend a lot of time this quarter as
much of the information we've already covered. The NIM chart on top left goes back to 2007 and tracks our NIM
in relation to Fed funds target rates. We all know we've operated in the zero rate environment before, so here we
go again. Hopefully, it won't last for seven years like it did last time.
Obviously, loan floors are critical in this environment, so we are pleased with where we are with the information
on the bottom left chart. As we mentioned in our press release last time, we believe that both PPP and our excess
liquidity negatively impacted our NIM by 32 basis points. There was a slide in the supplemental information that
shows how we calculated that number, but suffice to say that these two events have impacted our reported net
interest margin meaningfully.
Looking to the third quarter, we're optimistic that the GAAP margin will hold fairly steady and be somewhat
dependent on our third quarter PPP results. We've obviously have to counterpunch reduction in LIBOR with the
build in loan floors and reduce deposit pricing. Average liquidity, hopefully, will be down by modest amount in the
third quarter, so that too should be helpful.
Now the fee income. I'll be really brief. These were more than $72 million for the quarter, up slightly over the last
quarter and the same quarter of last year taking BHG out of the calculation, reflect significant growth as mortgage
period today during the second quarter. Consistent with our financial institutions, it's been a huge refinance
quarter and their pipelines are really strong currently, but we are anticipating a repeat of Q2 when we've
underestimated results from this group before.
Wealth management revenues were down this quarter from last quarter, primarily based on advisory fees for
investment services where fee revenues are received in arrears and are based on market performance. We
should see these revenues come back in the third quarter with a broader market rebound that has occurred. BHG
contributed approximately $17.2 million, which was slightly more than we anticipated, but more on BHG in a
second.
So, now briefly on expenses, personnel cost were down $ 7 million from the prior quarter due to reduced
incentives and reduced benefit cost. We don't have an exact number for PPP over time cost, but over time is up
about $300,000 this quarter over last quarter. As to benefit cost several speculate that medical expenses are
down due to elective procedures being sidelined or some portion of the quarter may be so. Consistent with prior
years, the usual reduction in payrolls and unemployment taxes also contributed to the reduced benefit cost.
As to COVID-related savings, we anticipate around $30 million to $40 million in incentive savings for both cash
and equity incentives as earnings were not being achieved through this year. We probably have another $3
million to $5 million in savings from travel, entertainment, expense reimbursement and other things that I really
haven't thought about.
Our cash incentive accrual is at 25% at quarter-end. This resulted in $4 million to $5 million reduction in incentive
costs this year. As many of you know, our annual cash incentive is based on EPS targets and for this year, we
adopted deposit growth component into our incentive plan and that deposit component is driving the incentive
accrual for our associates.

With the additional provisioning this year, our EPS incentive target is likely to be DOA, absent some remarkable
land between now and year-end. We are working with our board to provide some additional opportunity for our
associates so that we can keep them highly energized and motivated for ramp up operating performance of the
firm going into 2021. We're targeting an incremental 25% of target incentives, so in total, call it 50% of their
annual incentive target inclusive of the deposit component.
We spent a lot of time on CECL last quarter, so we'll be brief this time. We anticipated last time that we would
have another reserve build this quarter. As Terry mentioned, our reserve without PPP loans is at 1.41%, up from
1.09% last quarter.
We also increased our off-balance sheet reserve and as you probably know that $4.5 million is in our non-interest
expense line. We've included some additional information regarding unemployment and GDP forecast as these
are the two metrics that influence our CECL model, build and promote, unemployment being the most impactful.
You can see the weighted average unemployment rates in the green chart comparing last quarter to this quarter,
and compared to our rates that we've uses to at least one large cap firm that [indiscernible] (00:18:26) very
recently. Our 2Q 2020 weighted average rates are slightly lower than theirs, but our 1Q 2020 weighted average
rates were definitely higher. So, apples to apples, last quarter, we allocated more reserves as a result of
unemployment rates, and this quarter slightly less. Over and above all that, we added another $20 million into
reserve through a qualitative overlay just looking at uncertainty and we're having the depth and duration of the
pandemic that exists.
At the 3Q, I think we're all in a weird spot. Every bank is working on their own portfolio in an effort to gain more
visibility as the [indiscernible] (00:19:04). There are just a lot that we don't know and it's difficult to predict. Two
uncertainties are that the US Treasury will likely provide some amount of additional governmental assistance and
loan deferrals will gradually work themselves through. Both of those we believe are positive. The big negative is of
course the depth and duration of the pandemic.
At Pinnacle, we've learned a lot about our borrowers over the last quarter, and feel better about our book today
while we obviously will know more at September 30 with all steps that Tim's group is leading us through. Our best
guess right now is that we will continue to build reserves in the second half of the year until visibility improves.
Lastly this slide addresses what we think going into the third quarter. No guarantees but we're more optimistic
about things in general than we were at the beginning of March. That said, loan growth is likely to be soft, deposit
growth is as strong as we've ever experienced. It's an awful rate environment, we're optimistic that we can
increase core bank loans spreads and loan to deposit cost. PPP will have a significant influence on our results for
the next few quarters. We have great confidence in BHG which I will discuss in a minute.
Non-anticipating mortgage to set another record that they should have a solid third quarter. Expenses should be
relatively stable, still not willing to offer full year guidance due to COVID and its impact on credit. All things
considered, we feel confident PPNR will increase in the second half of the year.
Now briefly about tangible equity, our ratio dropped this quarter with the additional liquidity build and the PPP.
These are high-quality assets that will eventually exit our balance sheet. We believe we will manage back into the
highs and low-9s by year-end and into the first quarter of next year.
As BHG, we've shown this slide before and it's intended to give you a snapshot of BHG's business flows over time
and more importantly how they're holding up during the pandemic. The green bars on the chart are our
7

originations and have ramped up with more loans being funded, so business flows remained strong. Second
quarter volumes were down slightly from the last quarter, but this is our record first quarter.
The blue bars are the loans on which gain on sales has been recorded as these loans were sold to downstream
banks. This is the traditional BHG model with the annual sale revenues being generated. The blue bar did hit a
record placement in the second quarter as the auction platform remained in great shape and bankers remain
excited to purchase the BHG paper. The gold bars represent loans held by BHG on its balance sheet, for which
BHG will collect interest income, they were warehousing more loans on their balance sheet than they ever have
and with the first securitization of that to occur, the gold bar should back up some next quarter.
So, from 30,000 business loans, business flows remained incredibly healthy while the originations remained
strong, loan sales were at record levels, and BHG is prepared to execute on its first securitization within the next
few weeks.
On the top left chart, we've shown on several occasions the quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily in
first – in the last few years but particularly in 2020. They continue to refine their core products and increase the
quality of the borrowing base. And again, the right chart and I will reiterate maybe the most powerful chart I have
to offer related to BHG's steadily improving credit quality.
Looking at losses by vintage, losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination, thus pointing for the
lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans. Pandemic-related events will likely cause these loans
to move upward, but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much higher than
the borrowers from just a few years ago and I believe has helped investors better evaluate the opportunities with
respect to participating in their upcoming securitization.
And so, our deferrals as of June 30, total deferrals represented about 15% of the total book, up from 13% this
time last quarter. Then it's continued to lead the group as expected with a 35% deferral rate. BHG communicates
with these borrowers frequently and love to see these numbers decrease meaningfully in the third quarter as
deferral request are essentially nonexistent currently.
We've updated the historical charge-off and reserve builds, these are the loans that BHG has sold for a net worth
of [indiscernible] (00:23:36), the green bar shows that currently they've got almost $3.2 billion in credit with banks
that require their loans. The orange line shows the annual loss rate, while the blue line on the chart details the
recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks. Where the first three months of
2020 losses were running at about 4.5% and picked up only slightly to 4.56% for the six months ended June 30.
They have increased their recourse accrual again from 6.4% last quarter to 7.25% this quarter, we anticipate
some additional billing in this reserve going into second half of 2020. Lastly, we believe it's been a big year for
BHG and we anticipate big things for the rest of this year. During the quarter, the credit markets improved to allow
BHG the opportunity to execute on their first securitization. We at Pinnacle were successful in accessing the
credit markets with the $225 million preferred issuance in June. We and BHG believe that their securitization will
be successful and will get them in good spot to potentially execute on the non-secured relation in the next six
months or so. This allows BHG to continue to diversify its revenue stream away from getting all sales in the
interest income and provide another very competitively priced funding source, more to come on this in the third
quarter.
Lastly, as indicated on the slide, Fortune announced BHG as Best Place to Work in the State of New York. They
were number 2 last year, so it feels good to be number one. Congratulations to BHG on hitting that mark. So, here

plus associates driven firm that is now the Best Place to Work in the State of New York. I suppose many are
trying to replicate what they have build, but there is a special sauce at BHG. We are BHG's biggest clients and
are excited about the future of our partnership. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to talk about credit.

Timothy H. Huestis
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Harold. Good morning, everyone. From a credit perspective, second quarter was the continuation of
prior quarters for metrics such as past due loans, nonperforming assets, classified assets and net charge-offs. We
acknowledge COVID's full impact on the economy and our clients are still unfolding, but these standard measures
of loan quality continue to hold up well. Before I go into our credit slides, I wanted to outline our loan re-grading
work during the second quarter because our in-depth credit reviews maybe more than many of our peers. During
the second quarter, we re-risk graded all loans greater than $1 million with a payment deferral in every hotel loan
and every pre-retail loan greater than $1 million. Our re-grading effort was done at the loan level, not from a top of
the house portfolio approach. Our method was interaction with each borrower, one borrower at a time. We've re-
graded approximately 1,280 loans.
Our re-grading process entails collecting current monthly borrower financial statements or monthly property
operating statements, current personal financial statements, liquidity verification, contingent liability statements
are a guarantors. We believe collecting interim financial statements throughout 2020 will provide us with the
baseline, given that borrower 2019 yearend financial statement may not be indicative in assessing their current
financial health. For C&I loans, we deployed a survey questionnaire to gather feedback regarding key variables
such as revenue forecast for second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter compared with the same period in
2019, client ability to resume regular payments by the second, third and fourth quarter 2020, a question regarding
months of operating liquidity on hand, and finally, supply line disruption. Our bankers would discuss each question
with our clients, and then, record the client response using an online tool that enabled easy data aggregation. Our
goal during the second quarter was to identify and recognize those borrowers who warranted a non-pass risk
grade of criticized or classified.
We did have an increase in the criticized risk grade during second quarter that is largely attributed to our
hospitality book. We have moved approximately 78% of the hotel loan balances into the criticized risk grade
category. In our re-grading work, we placed significant waiving on the hotel industry, given its known challenges.
That said, fortunately, 74% of our hotel loans were in the economy, extended stay or limited service sector. By
mid-June, many of our clients in these sectors had occupancy rates in the upper 40%. Many of these clients can
cover interest expense at a mid-50% occupancy. But with the anticipated recovery period of the hotel industry
now less clear, we believe this conservative risk grade stance is appropriate.
Pinnacle's risk grading process is fluid and should the hospitality sector improve later this year or into 2021, we
will revisit the criticized classification of this portfolio. Our second largest increase in criticized was CRE Retail, but
its total was modest and only represented 4.4% of the CRE Retail loan balances. We acknowledge retail as an
impacted sector, but it will take time for the full impact of COVID on retail to be understood.
The remaining increase in criticized loans was both modest and very granular spread across many different
sectors. On a very positive note after concluding our very thorough second quarter review of all deferrals greater
than $1 million and reviewing all hotel loans and all CRE Retail loans greater than $1 million, our classified assets
at June 30 decreased $12 million from first quarter. Further, our NPAs decreased by $13 million from March 31 to
June 30.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
For our C&I clients with a loan payment deferral, we conducted a seven-question survey during late May and end
of June. Our survey tool aided us as a qualitative overlay in risk grading our clients. We surveyed 443 businesses
representing approximately $1 billion in loan balances. The results were guardedly optimistic. Three-quarters of
declines responded by fourth quarter, their top line revenue would be between 75% and 100% of the same
quarter in 2019. Three-quarters of declines responded that by third quarter their cash flow would be sufficient to
resume debt payments as originally agreed. 45% of the clients reported seven months or more of liquidity to cover
operating costs, and only 6% recorded a material supply chain disruption.
Pinnacle continues its approach of a well-balanced and granular portfolio. While our second quarter credit metrics
likely don't yet evidence the full impact of COVID on our loan portfolio, we understand that as physical stimulus
and PPP proceeds are extended, absent further stimulus, we may see these credit metrics change. As Harold has
elaborated, our provisioning is largely driven by economic forecast for unemployment and GDP and, as such, we
have meaningfully increased our credit loss reserve over the last two quarters.
Pinnacle adopted a defensive strategy during the second quarter and we will re-grade most of the remaining
portion of our loan portfolio at the loan level during the third quarter. Our emphasis will continue to be on
borrowers in highly impacted industries. Our goal is to quickly identify those borrowers who have been
meaningfully impacted and bring the appropriate resources of the bank for resolution, while there is an opportunity
to rehabilitate the credit and assess and improve our collaterals.
Pinnacle began proactively reaching out to the clients with loan payment deferrals during the third week of March.
We believe many of our clients accepted our payment deferral offer because the impact of COVID was unknown.
This chart illustrates that our deferrals have dropped by 37% of the peak. This large decline was confirmed by our
bankers talking to clients about their intention for a second deferral.
For our consumer loan portfolio with deferrals, we conducted a survey in June with 655 clients and the results
were encouraging. With a 78% response rate, we identified only $31 million in an elevated risk category. And of
these loans, all but four were secured by real estate. Additionally, 93% of our consumer loans that received a
deferral are secured by real estate. Pinnacle's 2009 consumer net charge off was 1.15%.
For our small business loan portfolio, we conducted a similar survey in June for 1,379 of our small business loans.
We gathered responses on 85% of the loans with deferrals and we identified only $18 million in elevated risk. And
of that total, 70% are secured by real estate.
Pinnacle's approach to the hospitality sector has been a disciplined, conservative approach of banking hotel
sponsors who are well-capitalized and have a long track record of successful operation. Many of these sponsors
have been large Pinnacle depositors. A few attributes to illustrate our conservative hotel loan approach; weighted
average loan-to-value 55%, weighted average 2019 debt service coverage of 2.1% for stabilized properties. 91%
of our loans have personal guarantees.
Prior to COVID, we had only one non-performing loan of just $3 million. This loan is an SBA loan originated by a
bank that Bank of North Carolina had acquired years ago. While in most markets, hotel occupancy numbers have
rebounded from the lows seen in March and April, we believe it is too soon to discern a sustainable trend where
we are optimistic based upon the data we are collecting. The most important attribute of our hotel book is that
74% of our exposure is comprised of extended stay economy and limited service, which are the segments that
have experienced the greatest rebound in occupancy rates.

The conservative LTV of 55% of our hotels offers an opportunity to return to profitability at lower occupancy and
ADR. They do not have to return to 2019 levels to be profitable. Pinnacle provided $42 million in PPP loans to our
hotel clients. We have 21 hotel loans under construction, of which 50% of the commitments have been funded to-
date. Limited, extended stay economy constitutes 77% of our hotel construction loans. During the second quarter
re-grading effort, we had just one loan of $2.6 million located in Myrtle Beach moved into a classified loan status.
The LTV on that loan is 44%.
Out of Pinnacle's 116 hotels, only one is closed, it's a small hotel loan of just $3 million in Durham, North Carolina.
Business center, resort, high-end and airport properties are under the greatest amount of stress. Our exposure in
these categories is limited to a few in business center and airport categories. While the stress is not necessarily
expected to be alleviated in the short run, our borrowers have strong track records and the performance we
believe positions them well for a recovery.
Hotel deferrals decreased 14% from the peak. Local and state laws in pandemic conditions continue to have a
disparate impact on hospitality performance. Long-term, we believe the states in which we have finance hotels
are growth markets that will see stronger recoveries in the overall national economy. 88% of our hotels are within
Pinnacle's footprint.
This slide provides some details on our loans in the restaurant sector. It groups together exposure to real estate
developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators. Some noteworthy points
include, this segment is just 3% of our loan book.
Pinnacle's very successful PPP program provided $179 million in cushion to our clients in this segment. Loans
with deferrals decreased meaningfully from the peak. Presently just 21% of our loan balances have a loan
payment deferral. Approximately half of our total exposure is real estate secured with a conservative LTV of 56%.
87% of our exposure is within our footprint.
Our 10 largest non-owner occupied CRE loans leased restaurants none have a payment deferral coupled with
conservative LTVs. Our quick service segment is made up of names like Taco Bell, Sonic, Wendy's and KFC. Our
two largest restaurant operator exposures are well-known public companies with various loan management
teams. We have only six restaurant operator exposures greater than $10 million and four of the six do not have
payment deferrals.
This slide provides some insight into our retail portfolio. It consists of both retail store operators and commercial
real estate loans leased to retail operators. Pinnacle's very successful PPP program provided $187 million of
cushion to our clients. Loans with deferrals are now just 18% of the total portfolio balances. As of June 30, our
teams reviewed all loans over $1 million secured by existing retail properties. Each property's economics were
mark-to-market by underwriting current rent rolls, identifying those tenants which had received rent relief over a
defined period. Our pre-retail book is extremely granular with over 700 loans averaging just $1.7 million.
This slide provides some more insight into our retail book. It's a well-diversified portfolio with only 3 of the top 10
loans with payment deferrals. We have no regional malls. 16% of our retail portfolio is grocery-anchored shopping
centers. Approximately 31% of our CRE loans are single-tenant properties. A very high percentage of those
stores remained open as they generally house essential tenants, such as Tractor Supply Company, Dollar
General, O'Reilly Auto Parts, 7-Eleven and Walgreens.
There's been a lot of news coverage regarding big-name retailers like Pier 1 or Bed Bath & Beyond and other
names that are struggling. Pinnacle Bank has always maintained a very limited appetite for power retail centers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
We only have five power retail centers in our entire portfolio with primary tenants like Walmart, Harris Teeter,
Hobby Lobby, DICK'S Sporting Goods.
In our retail construction book, only nine loans are greater than $5 million. For our CRE retail construction book,
50% are built-to-suit single tenant. Of our strip center construction loans, 75% of the space is pre-leased. The
average strip center is a small neighborhood center with the loan size of approximately $4 million.
This slide provides some inside into our entertainment portfolio, over 50% of our entertainment exposure is in the
music publishing space to finance the acquisition of song catalogs. Pinnacle Bank has a financial advisor that
specializes in this discipline. His extensive experience and strong contacts have [indiscernible] (00:41:47) this
niche into a national [indiscernible] (00:41:49) program.
Each catalog of songs is made up of thousands of well-seasoned, diversified songs that are stable from an
earnings standpoint. Revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from music streaming fees paid from firms
like Spotify, Apple, Amazon and terrestrial radio. To a lesser degree, sync revenue is generated from songs in the
catalog used in film, TV commercials and general licensing. Country music streaming is up 13% since the start of
the pandemic, in catalogs with seasoned older songs are also up materially as well. Sync has had some pressure,
but digital revenues are up largely offsetting other declines.
This asset class is largely considered an uncorrelated annuity and as such institutional investment in this space in
recent years has been robust. The loans have appropriate loan covenants that permit close monitoring. Average
LTDs are under 50%, Pinnacle's very successful PPP program provided $53 million of cushions to our clients.
Terry now I'll turn it back over to you to talk about moving forward in this pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tim. In last quarter call, it was my objective to get everybody all know moving forward in this
pandemic it was our intend to move from offense to defense, to slower our investment and growth until the storm
has been weathered and the environment is once again conducive to our unusual ability to attract talent and take
share.
Defense will continue to be our number one focus as we move into the second half 2020. We've elevated the
liquidity meaningfully. We've taken actions to preserve and increase capital. We've built our allowance for credit
loss substantially in the first two quarters and Harold has already indicated [indiscernible] (00:43:51) further
elevation in the second half of this year.
As you already heard from Tim, we allocated enormous resource to the re-risk-grading of the more difficult loans
in our portfolio during the second quarter and it's our intent to finish re-risk-grading the rest of the graded loan
portfolio during the third quarter. That said, I believe our aggressive addition to revenue producers over the last
two years, we were still in the early stages of consolidating their client base from where they were before to us,
should result ongoing growth albeit at a slower pace than what we would have been producing pre-COVID.
As we've already discussed, while we won't hire nearly as many as we had planned this year in order to contain
expense growth, we will continue to make important hires. The truth is, from a client perspective, these are the
times that firms like ours are able to clearly differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of how we value
clients and consequently we expect to pick up important market share that fuels earnings growth that will come
out other side of the economic slowdown.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
Specifically, we intend to maintain elevated levels of liquidity until we find a more certain economic footing. Right
now, as you heard Harold say, we intend to begin reducing some liquidity over the third and fourth quarters, but
ultimately we'll unwind the institutional portion of that and pick up that cost savings when it's appropriate but
ultimately, we'll unwind the institutional portion of that and pick up that cost savings when it's appropriate. After
our $225 million preferred issuance, we feel like we're in great shape on capital and consequently don't anticipate
any further capital actions at this time.
As I've mentioned before, although we don't tend to cut our dividends this time, we're still in a capital preservation
mode, suspending our share buyback program and retaining the sub-debt that we had previously intended to
redeem. So, we expect in our primary mechanism for growing our capital position from this point forward is
through retained earnings, and hopefully, our very strong pre-tax pre-provision ROA of 1.82% demonstrates that
we'll have the flexibility to do just that.
We've slowed our recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense bills and enable us to maximize pre-
provision net revenue as an important aspect of our defensive posture. I want to be clear, we've not frozen hiring
completely we've just slowed it, and of course, relative to our 2020 plan, we'll harvest a significant amount of the
budgeted incentives that are tied to the EPS targets, which offers expense run rate in 2020 meaningfully.
So, much of what we've been talking about is defense, but one of the things that governs us during a time like this
is the value that we place on our client relationships. Many of our competitors in the past have been viewed as
reactionary and heavy-handed and consequently they have meaningfully damaged their reputations for valuing
long-term relationships. It would surprise me, if it were different than that this time.
But following the Great Recession, according to Greenwich Associates, Pinnacle had earned the best reputation
in our markets for valuing long-term client relationships and that bond remains critical to us now. On the bar chart
on the left, you can see that this is a time that not only you can [indiscernible] (00:47:04) client loyalty, but it's a
time you can make clients for life.
Keep in mind, I believe that Greenwich is doing research for virtually all of the top 50 banks in the country plus
about 600 more. Among all those banks and all those markets, they are already finding that the differentiation that
took place in the Great Recession is in fact taking place now. How banks handle deferrals thus far in the
pandemic makes a difference. How banks manage the PPP process makes a difference.
And based on their extensive research with bank clients, Greenwich has recognized [indiscernible] (00:47:38)
very large group of banks for whom they do research is standing out on those variables that are important to
clients and we're thrilled to be one of them. When you combine the longstanding relationship that we've built for
valuing long-term client relationships, with the fact that Greenwich has found, there has been much angst over the
PPP process which has already eroded bank loyalty among businesses and their owners. That, of course,
provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity for market share takers like us to harvest a great deal of market
share.
Last quarter, Greenwich has already found that 3 in 10 companies with annual revenues between $5 million and
$500 million intend to switch banks, 3 in 10; 30% market share is already up for grabs. That's between two and
three times the normal level and it's still early in the crisis. So, even at this point in the crisis, we believe things like
our handling of deferrals and the PPP process are burnishing our reputation for valuing clients and it would be
one of the primary beneficiaries of the market share movement that will inevitably occur and benefit as we come
out the other side.

Thanks, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I'm curious on the guidance around BHG. It seems like it was intimated that 3Q revenues will be similar to 2Q, but
then looking at the one slide, it also notes that year-over-year earnings growth should be up. So, I'm wondering if
that implies an extremely large 4Q and if so, is that driven by the securitization or something else [indiscernible]
(00:49:44)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think 3Q will be similar to 2Q. We're not sure about 4Q right now, and I'm trying to find that slide...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I think it was slide 22 where it shows just BHG net earnings going up in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a range of earnings between like 110 to maybe going up above.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. That makes – okay, thanks. And then kind of thinking about the NIM moving forward, I mean,
obviously you noted the 32 basis point of drag from liquidity and PPP loans, but I'm wondering where you think –
whenever liquidity does normalize, let's call sometime early 2021 for argument's sake, where do you think the
NIM could normalize at that point in time? Is that kind of back north of 3%?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
Yeah. We think so. We think that demand will begin to increase back into the low-3s, call it, second quarter of
next year and at the same time, the accretion from the BNC loans that we acquired will be trailing off to pretty
much an insignificant amount.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Okay. And then maybe just last thing for me; obviously you guys noted that you will continue hiring, you
have slowed, I'm just wondering if you can give some color as to where you are in the face of the Atlanta plans
relative to the 50 RM target longer term? And then you guys have never really been a [indiscernible] (00:51:36)
cutting expanses on a net basis, more about investing for future growth, but is there any likelihood in this
environment we could see some sort of expense initiative? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
In the case of Atlanta, I would believe these numbers are roughly correct. I think we ended the first quarter with
about $40 million in loan outstandings and nearly $30 million in core deposits. I would view that to be a successful
and ahead of plan for what was effectively the first quarter operation there.
So, we continue to be excited both about the recruiting pipeline of associates as well as the recruitment of clients,
it look like to me their pipelines are solid for another good quarter here in the third quarter. I think as it relates to
the expense initiatives, I think your assumption is basically right, our approach on the expense initiatives – I would
characterize more about trying to drive PPNR up now because that's how we fund a lot of stuff we've gotten
funded and at this time we need to be on defense. But I don't think you ought to expect us to have real meaningful
expense initiatives where we're going and making structural changes to the business.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
Sticking with the margin and NII side, you talked about the liquidity drawdown to that $1.4 million, should we
assume sort of that $1.4 billion of wholesale coming off call it $400 million a quarter or is it not quite that linear?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, it's definitely not linear, Jared, but we're anticipating about, call it, $700 million between now and the end of
the year granted that's about half of it between now and the next four quarters, but it's not exactly on straight line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then on the floors that you're putting in, can you give a little more detail around – is that actually -
should we expect to see some loan yield pick up on those, are those floors above where we are here or is that
just more protection for the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We're optimistic that we will get loan floors, call it, in the mid-3s or on the LIBOR based credit. So, we're
hopeful to get some accretion and yield on those particular loans, but we're also doing things with some
borrowers to protect against negative rates. So, there's some of that going on as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q

Okay. And then just finally from me, it's great color that Tim gave on credit. Could you give an update on how the

how you're trying to evaluate those pools of loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, thanks, we did reach out to those clients, I'm trying to find my exact note here, I think we reached out and
touched 1,379 of our small business loans and the results were very encouraging, I mean, I realize it's
preliminary, but out of those 1,379 small business loans and a response rate of 85%, we only identified $18
million that we would call elevated risk. So, that continues to be an area of focus for us, but our survey results,
and this was done in mid-June, came back quite positive.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One more on credit just to dig into the deferrals a little bit, the reduction was really encouraging to see. Is there
also a way to dissect that to look at what dollar number has asked for a second round of deferrals? And then
maybe the dollar amount that you expect to come up for to come off deferral over the next, call it, couple of
months, just so we can kind of – the decline was great, but just kind of think about how much of that is just from it
running off and how much is actually we're doing in a phase 2?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jennifer, I would tell you – I mean, Catherine, I'm sorry. That decline was as of yesterday. We all know we were
doing deferrals in April, mid-April, late April, early May, and that window will come open soon. In talking with our
FAs, we believe the declines will continue. It's hard for me to give you a hard number, but I think that they will
continue to decline based on conversations that our FAs have had with clients about deferrals that hit that 90-day
window, early August, mid-August, late August.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And how does the phase 2 look like? What are you doing differently with the modifications?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
When we rolled out our program, it was a 90 plus 90, Catherine. So, we would talk to that client before the first
90-day period, and if we felt and credit qualified them, we would extend that second 90 days using that same
initial document that was executed. I will tell you with any of the new deferrals, and we've had just an
inconsequential number since the 1st of June, they've just dropped off, we are now asking for all the financial
statements upfront before we make a decision, so we can grade that credit right then on the spot.

Great. Okay, great. And then, switching to BHG, is there any color you can give on what gain on sale margins has
done this quarter versus last, or they are still staying steady or have you seen those pull back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, they were pretty steady for most of the quarter. I think in June, they've fallen back about a half a percent or
so. But I don't think, they're not anticipating to see any kind of, you know trend line lower than what they've

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Sticking with BHG, I think that in the loss rate slide that you cover on for the loss rate stats cover on slide
21 is very helpful. Where does that – or what are you thinking in terms of where that peaks and when. I know
that's probably the hardest question, but what's your read on where the things peak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah Brock, I think it is a great question, you're right it's an impossible one to answer, but and I'm assuming
you're talking about the orange line specifically.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So – and they believe that it's probably going to be in this 6% kind of range somewhere in that neighborhood. It
could be more, it could be less, but right now the – they grade the book every month. So, they are still hanging in
there, but obviously the deferral results will be very insightful [indiscernible] (01:00:12). But currently they are not
anticipating like a 2x kind of number, they are taking this more like another 50 basis points or I'm sorry 100 basis
points, call it 100 basis points to 150 basis points.

Okay. And on the securitization I mean it looks like very bold timing here. I would have thought you would get
better execution if you had waited. But at the same time very reassuring that you think you can get this done with
BHG. And is this going to be kind of a niche financing vehicle or is this really the wave of the future now BHG
finances itself going forward longer-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think they will use it as part of their financing package. Last year, when they had the Analyst Day, I think
they mentioned somewhere around [indiscernible] (01:01:15) 50-50 revenue split between gain on sale and
interest income, so it will take a few years to get to that. But, they intend to approach the markets in a really active
way and I would guess that might be three times a year probably, something like that. So, they want to get some
experience with it and use that as a kind of a permanent tool in their tool box.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. It's exciting. Lastly, on the expenses, if I'm doing the math right, I would think that 2020 expense base is
around [ph] 550 (01:01:58) annualizing the Q4 2019? Is that kind of in straight from [indiscernible] (01:02:06)?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mentioned on the call that we may include another incentive component. So, your number, we ought to

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I would – Jennifer, I would carry it just anecdotally the count of people has rebounded some, I will see them
on the streets in the evening when I leave, but it's nowhere what it was pre-COVID. I think, the spike in cases and
the drop in tourism has been very noticeable and pronounced, but I've been surprised, Jennifer, with the number
of people that have returned. So, I don't really have specific percentages or dollars for you, just more perception
of working downtown it is off and likely will remain so for a while.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jennifer, I may add to that, of course, a lot of what drives tourism is Music City Center and they don't have any
conventions and they don't anticipate any until 2021. So, that's pretty meaningful indicator. I think in terms of
downtown hotels, many are open, but there are still a few that are closed or operating with limited service and so
forth. So, clearly there's an impact. I think Tim's point, I'm not sure whether to describe it as fortunate or
unfortunate, but I do encounter more pedal taverns these days than they had over the last few months.
And so, to Tim's point, I think, some of the tourism has rebounded, but I'd classify in an early stage, I wouldn't
think we would in, be at a midpoint of the return on the tourism in Nashville. Obviously that's an impact I think you
look at sort of the reopenings Jennifer and Nashville like every city and every state there's going to be phased
reopening plan with 94 stages of reopening. We hoped by now we'd be in the third phase, but we were really
backed up into the second phase of reopening, because of the coronavirus cases have spiked like a lot other
cities that are reopening and my belief is what we're seeing there is the same thing we're seeing in other markets,
where it's concentrated in young people who are perhaps more fearless than a 65-year old, I don't know if that's
helpful to you, but.

It is, have you heard any anecdotes on corporate relocation pipelines for Nashville or do you think that come to a
bit of halt here with the crisis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
My sense is that the corporate relocation pipeline is still full. I don't recall any major announcement of late, but I do
believe that Amazon announced in an addition to their office – their opening – their jobs that they were bringing
they are adding another I don't know how many thousand jobs. It is a big deal you know there's a – there's one –
well, there's a recent announcement, you know what that was?

A
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I can't remember either anyway. Jennifer, it seems like to me that the development pipeline continues to be
strong.

Thanks so much.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi Steven. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
First, regarding the additional potential incentive this year, maybe to set up a stronger 2021, can you give more
color on this and maybe what options you're looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're looking at probably a corporate PPNR measurement, maybe trying to understand what we
think 2021 looks like if we can get a [indiscernible] (01:07:35) of loan growth, continue to see strong deposit
inflows. What our fee businesses are driving or what we think will happen in 2021 and what do we need to do
today and ramp into it. So, it'll be along those kind of thought processes. Steve, I don't know if that's helpful or
not...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
...but we'll probably likely exclude credit from it because it's difficult to incent people around credit. Particularly, in
this, we definitely want to be early in and early out, so we want to get our loss content recognized as soon as
possible. And when you marry that up with some kind of incentive plan, it becomes sometimes a little difficult.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
Steven, I might add to Harold's comments, so many of the key actions to be successful, I think, for us on the
PPNR are really driving the cost funds lower faster and picking up right floors that are higher penetration. Those
kinds of actions are the things that we're trying to stimulate here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And what's the timing that you think something like this could be rolled out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, we think probably over the next couple of months. We talked to our board about it. I think we received
favorable responses from them. I think they understand the concept and the benefit that it could drive for
shareholders. So I think probably over the next couple of months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then on credit, it was nice to see the classified loans come down in the quarter, what
was the trend you saw in criticized and watch list in 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
On criticized, we moved the bulk of the hotel book into the criticized size category that was about $750 million. So
obviously, the percentage of our loans for criticized this quarter had gone up significantly. We did have some in
our C&I book and some in the CRE retail, but it was largely driven by our recognition of the distress of the
hospitality sector.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then finally, for Terry, you mentioned there is a good opportunity to take customers and it
depends how peers handle deferrals, PPP et cetera. Curious what are you seeing from regional bank peers, are
they struggling to offer PPP in these different programs? And maybe if they are, why is it technology or work from
home or something else? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think what – I guess – Steven, I'd go ahead just in terms of our personal experience and then I'll go back
to the Greenwich. So I think in terms of our personal experience, most of the big – I shouldn't say most, a number
of the big banks within we compete, they were not able to get their system up early. It took them – they were late
days to get PPP system up to even accept applications. I think they were very slow, which, of course, everybody
was slow, but I think their ability to communicate to clients and keep them up to date on where they were in the
process and all those kind of things was really deficient.
And so that was the experience that we saw and then to some, maybe a little more reliable than just my own
observation there, I think in the case of Greenwich, they've seen that there is a significant angst throughout the
system as this tied the both deferrals and PPP, where – so my job is how you deal with the client. As an example,
I think about what we're doing to go out here and gather all this information, conduct these surveys. If you go out

there with a heavy-handed approach like a lot of those companies are prone to do, you might achieve the same
result.
But we're out there trying to do it in a way that inspires confidence and make sure that they understand that, this
review is helpful for them and us, not only as it help us to understand the risk, but it puts us in a position to better
take care of them, if we're in a position to document what their path forward is, as the company reopens and so
forth. So anyways, anecdotally, we certainly saw it and it was tied to some measure to their ability to get their
systems up and it was tied in some measure to just how they interface with clients and their inability to talk to
clients and tell them where they were in process and so forth.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Just one question back to the deferrals, maybe for Tim, just with the progress you guys have made already, I
guess, Tim, what do you anticipate the deferrals end, I guess, October, December, kind of, as you get through
working through more of these and do more of the risk re-grading, and I guess, is it a significantly lower level than
we're at today is that and then, maybe who might be looking at the most at the request for second deferrals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
The second deferrals have been hospitality. And I see us doing a lot of re-grading, restructuring of the hospitality
loans. Probably, we've got a playbook written out for that so that everybody knows what we're doing. But I would
see us restructuring many of the hospitality loans in the third quarter, asking the client for help with perhaps
23

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2020
collateral guarantees for cash and under the CARES 4013 Act, we'll restructure the loan and try and bridge until
the property stabilizes in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And how about – I guess that's helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe one for Harold, just on the
expenses, and Terry, just recruiting you guys have scaled back this year, I guess do you anticipate they're getting
back to kind of a normal level as you look through next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
It's hard to know, Brian. I don't mean to hedge on the question, but I guess you'd have to tell me where are we
going to be on a vaccine, where are we going to be on reopening the economy, all those kind of things before I
could give you an answer to the question. I think, we believe that by being semi-active, which is, as you know,
we're still talking to prospects and so forth, is that we'll be able to turn that switch pretty quickly. But you know, it's
more about finding a more certain footing and when we do, then we'll be ready to go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. And then, just last one, I think you guys gave some color or detail on the PPP forgiveness.
But just the percentage of loans you guys would expect to be forgiven today and just kind of, I guess, what were
you anticipating in the fourth quarter on that component?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Brian, it's somewhere around 25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
[indiscernible] (01:15:14) for fourth quarter and then total, Harold, I guess your expectation is what percent of it
gets forgiven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
As far as whole thing over the next...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think we have about 10% that goes out the full two years.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So 9% in total, okay. That's all I had, guys. Thanks so much.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, thanks for taking the call. Just following up on the hotel deferrals, so should we assume then that by the end
of the year, any of the more troubled portfolio or troubled properties has been restructured and ultimately come off
as deferral? Or should we assume that some of those more troubled ones could be in deferral for a much longer
period of time that's allowed under the CARES Act?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. What we will do in the third and it might – some of them might spill into early fourth quarter is modify the
loan, not a deferral. We will be looking at collateral guarantee so forth, and asking their cooperation, maybe
they're putting up cash for part of their deferral. And with that modification under the CARES Act 4013, we don't
have to flag it as a TDR. So, our goal will be to get all of the hotel loans that are showing signs of recovery modify.
It may be a modification that extends an interest-only period into 2021 and then resuming amortization mid to later
2021, but we'll be working that with each borrower one-by-one based upon how their property is recovering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So it's current by the end of the year, just maybe current under a new structure as opposed to deferring
under the old structure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Correct, we will modify the loan before the year-end with the new repayment term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude your program and you may now
disconnect.
