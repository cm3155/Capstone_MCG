Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review the third quarter results. I trust everybody has
had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As usual, they're available including the earnings
presentation that we'll be referring to during the call on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com
website.
I'm going to first turn the call over to the CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments; and then ask Paul
Donofrio, our CFO, to cover some other elements.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me just remind you we may make forward-looking statements and
refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call just regarding various elements of our financials. The
forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and they're
subject to risk and uncertainties, particularly as we continue to operate in this pandemic period.

Factors that may cause those results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials
in the SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures,
including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials available on the website.
So with that, take it away, Brian.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining, and I hope all of you are staying safe. We're going to begin on
slide 2, and today before Paul takes you through the detail in the financials, I thought I'd give you some thoughts
on the first three quarters of 2020 and how we're driving for you here at Bank of America.
As an opening comment, the economy and the markets this year have been defined more than anything else by
the impact of the global health care crisis. This has created a stimulus path for the recovery. As we have said
early on here at Bank of America and what our data continues to suggest is that we are seeing a return to the
fundamentals of a generally sound underlying economy, but we won't get there until we have fully addressed the
health care crisis and its associated effects. These effects have been lessened by the monetary and fiscal policies
and by the core health of the US consumer, given those policies.
There are three key themes that I'd like to comment on. One is the economy generally, what we see in our data,
and the impact of the projected path on the economy's earnings â€“ and the company's earnings and prospects
going forward. The second is how we continue to think about and manage the risk resulting from the economic
downturn and the subsequent beginnings of the recovery. And the third is how we are making progress given all
that backdrop on our core strategies.
Before I touch on these items, just a brief summary of the quarter. Overall, solid performance given the operating
backdrop we face. We earned around $5 billion after tax or $0.51 per share. We ended the quarter with a capital
ratio of 11.9% versus 9.5% minimum. For the third period of this pandemic, we've earned more than twice our
dividends, attesting to the strong balance sheet and security of this company.
The operating environment continues to require more operational excellence than ever before. It requires delivery
of immediate technology capabilities across our franchise from our group of talented teammates. It also has to
deliver a customer experience that can be redefined on a daily basis. It also has to meet customer demands
which ebb and flow given the daily events. It has required extra costs to do the right thing to protect our
teammates, our clients, and our franchise, all while processing higher transaction levels and dealing with volatility
and the high volumes that come from it. It requires [indiscernible] (00:04:06) work on delivery on a day-to-day
basis.
This results in expense that remains elevated this quarter, that's expenses from COVID. However, our disciplined
expense management remains well intact. We have turned the corner on these COVID costs. As we see forward
in the fourth quarter, we see the costs coming back down in the company. That is evidenced by the drop this
quarter of 3,000 in our head count on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And Paul will talk more about the path going
forward in a minute.
So let's start with the economy and its impact on our company. We saw another partial restoration of the US
economy. We saw that in our outside data and we saw it in the large base of spending in our customers. As you
think through the quarters, in the first quarter, our customer spending was impacted as we hit March after a strong
start to the year. However, for the quarter, our customers still spent more than they did in the first quarter of 2019.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
The second quarter saw the worst of the crisis in terms of spending. It was a 30% drop in GDP and the spending
fell deeply in April but started to recovery as stimulus PPP and other monetary policy kicked in into May and June,
and also the reopenings began.
In the third quarter, we've seen a full restoration of spending by Bank of America customers when compared to
last year. Overall, the customer payment levels in September 2020 were larger than September 2019. Year to
date, they'll cross $2.3 trillion in spending at Bank of America. Customers have spent more than they did last year.
You could see that on slide 26 in the appendix. This has occurred even as some of the summer 2020 stimulus
programs have run their course. Our own Bank of America economic experts predict a sharp rebound in third
quarter GDP of around 30%. So simply put, we're back to 90%-plus where we were in terms of GDP size.
So what are we seeing as we turn in October? The spending by our consumers is still solid, about 10% ahead of
last year. Deposits remain elevated and continue to grow in Consumer Banking and Global Wealth Management.
In Global Banking deposits are flattish, as customers continue to make choices about liquidity. We are seeing
loan demand stabilize and we may have seen a trough in September. In commercial, utilization rates have come
down below pre-pandemic levels last year. As the economy continues to grind forward, we believe we will see
some demand recover over the next few quarters.
In consumer lending, card balances appear to be stabilized and credit spending continues to grow, and we are
growing at new accounts in our consumer card businesses. New accounts are growing in our auto lending
business, and our mortgage business is stable. So this view of loan demand and more stability of balances, the
ability to redeploy some cash balances, given the now lengthier stability of customer deposits leads us to believe
that the third quarter was a trough quarter for NII, and Paul will cover more of that later.
The second topic I want to touch about is going to slide 3 on the risks. We continue to remain focused on all the
risks, whether in market and trading risk, credit operation and reputational risks, given the incredible volumes and
unusual working conditions that we're all in. Going back to the first quarter volatility, the concern was obviously
market risk. We've handled this market risk well. And again, for this quarter, the team made trading profits on
every single day. Our capital levels in the quarter are at historically high levels, as I stated before, and liquidity
stands at over $860 billion.
Credit risk is the current focus in this quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on slide 3. Charge-offs
declined for the quarter. Reserve build this quarter was on the commercial side. Mostly, that's due to the specified
industries that are facing still not being fully open and the length of time it may be till they reopen. Consumer card
release reserves, for example, we believe we are staying ahead of the commercial risk by aggressively reviewing
our portfolios. Over the last two quarters, in each quarter, we've done 100% review of all the middle market and
business banking portfolios to ensure we have strong internal ratings, integrity and focus on the ability to pay as
well as just having liquidity.
You can see an increase in the criticized exposure that comes from those views and re-ratings but it was more
focused on the certain industries, and Paul will touch on that. In the first couple weeks, we've seen the criticized
assets come back down as some of those clients refinance.
Meanwhile, overall, non-performing loans remain around $4.5 billion, with commercial basically flat to last quarter
and consumer growing around $200 million. Overall, the balance of non-performing loans remains at a modest 48
basis points to loans. This is a testimony to the decade of responsible growth this company has engaged in.

Importantly, the deferral story, which we talked about the last couple quarters, is largely over. We only have
100,000 customers remaining on deferral at the end of September. Of the $9 billion in total consumer balances
that remain on deferral, $7.5 billion are mortgage loans. Those are well secured and low loan-to-value and have
[ph] among (00:09:17) many other positive attributes, including 25% to 30% of them are in the Wealth
Management business.
All are accounted for in our reserves based on the expected losses [indiscernible] (00:09:28) Interesting, both
card delinquencies and mortgage delinquencies are down in terms of dollar amount and percent year-over-year.
Having said all this around credit, we don't expect to see meaningful increase in net charge-offs till mid next year
and we expect that the reserve builds are behind us, which means the P&L impact of those losses should be in
our financials already.
So then the question becomes, after managing the risk, is have we been investing in the company at the same
time? And that you can see as you move to slide 4. Through our continued investments in technology, we
continue to improve our platforms across the board, drive operational excellence, invest in the future, all while
growing core customer client households throughout the quarter. In our commercial businesses, we're now
actively [ph] prospecting again (00:10:15) having done the reviews I spoke about early, fully assessing the credit
quality of existing clients and then focusing our production work on the prospects we know we can get around the
country.
In our consumer business, we continue to grow net core checking households by about 900,000 year-over-year
and $100 billion-plus in checking balances. We saw a strong growth in Merrill Edge, our consumer customer
investment platform, by $40 billion in assets year-over-year. We see depth and penetration on digital engagement
across the whole consumer business.
In our Wealth Management business, even as our advisors work from home, our private bankers and financial
advisors grew households again this quarter. In fact, we reached a record new client balances of $3 trillion. We
also continue our investments in our market expansion in the crisis. We added 13 new financial centers in the
quarter and continue to offset that number with closures that were pre-planned before the pandemic.
[ph] But here we (00:11:12) continue to change the companies is in the digital capabilities, not only in consumer
but across the board in every business. This digital enablement is the trifecta of better customer engagement and
client delight, deeper penetration of products and services, and operating efficiency. And with the rollout of a new
industry feature like this week's Life Plan announcement where we now have 500,000 customers who have
already filled out a Life Plan financial plan over the last couple weeks. You can see these digital engagement
highlights on slide 4. This quarter we had 2.3 billion in total digital logins in our consumer business. Erica's up to
16 million users, Zelle is at 12 million users.
Importantly, you see at the bottom of the list, the digital engagement of our Wealth Management customers.
Through that digital platform, Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank are again proving that we're high touch and high
tech. This ranges from how we provide advice and personal research to how our clients have interacted with us to
do things like just deposit checks. And that was up dramatically over the quarter as our advisory clients embraced
our new digital capabilities.
In the middle of the page, you see the statistics for our commercial business for our products called CashPro and
CashPro Mobile. This makes our clients' lives easier and saves them operating costs. And here in the CashPro
area, we rolled out a bunch of new features and user interfaces and capabilities last week to allow companies and

company treasurers to better manage their money around the world in all kinds of currencies and all kinds of
environments.
So in summary, $5 billion in after-tax earnings and a solid quarter. Progress on the economic recovery, progress
on the risk, but most importantly underlying that business, strong growth in the business side â€“ in the customer
side of the business which is what we do and will continue to do it in perpetuity.
With that, let me turn it over to Paul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. I'm starting on slide 5 and 6 together. In most periods, my earnings remarks are focused on year-
over-year comparisons but this quarter, many of my comments will be directed towards comparisons against Q2
2020 as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress quarter over quarter as we work
sequentially through the health crisis and given COVID has made year-over-year comparisons less relevant.
Q3 net income of $4.9 billion, or $0.51 per share, compares to $3.5 billion, or $0.37, in Q2. The earnings
improvement was driven by lower provision expense as we modestly added to the reserves for credit losses in Q3
compared to the more significant increase in reserves in Q2. Versus Q2, the lower provision expense was mostly
offset by lower NII and higher cost of litigation and costs of the COVID environment. Lower rates and loan
balances caused NII compression, which I will discuss in a moment.
The linked quarter decline in non-interest income was driven by the more robust trading and IB environment in
Q2, as well as a $700 million gain on the sale of mortgages recorded in Q2. While down linked quarter, fees from
capital markets in both market [ph] banking (00:14:37) and investment banking were solidly up year-over-year. At
$1.8 billion, investment banking fees were the second-best quarter in the company's history. [ph] Brian did our
(00:14:48) progress in activities levels across many of our businesses and that showed up in increased levels of
fees, which helped to mitigate the linked quarter decline in capital markets revenue. Q3 saw card income and
service charges move higher from the more heavily impacted Q2 levels. We also experienced higher asset
management fees as the market improved, and we grew net new households again this quarter.
Turning to expenses, they were higher in Q3 than Q2, driven by three things. First, we built litigation reserves for
litigation with respect to some older matters. Second, we had an increase in COVID-related costs. And third, this
is the first quarter in which we recorded merchant servicing expense. It is important to point out that the increase
from recording merchant servicing expense and even some of the increase in COVID-related costs were
associated with increases in reported revenue, which obviously helps defray their impact on profits.
And with respect to the linked quarter change in pre-tax pre-provision income, I would also point out that the $1.3
billion of the decline was driven by two more abnormal items: the prior period loan sale gain of $700 million and
this quarter's elevated litigation expense of about $600 million. In addition, given a reversal in UK tax policy, our
results included a $700 million positive adjustment to our tax expense as we revalued our UK deferred tax asset
that had been previously written down. Our ROTCE was 10% and ROA was 71 basis points.
Moving to the balance sheet on slide 7, we ended the quarter little changed from Q2 at $2.7 trillion in total assets.
The main point I want to make about the balance sheet is the redeployment of some of our excess liquidity out of
cash and reverse repo and into securities. Cash and reverse repo declined by about $112 billion from Q2 while
security levels rose by a similar amount. This will help offset NII compression from lower reinvestment rates in
6

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
coming quarters. The only other notable point on the balance sheet was the decline in loans driven by customer
paydowns.
Shareholders equities increased $3.2 billion as earnings were more than twice the amount of dividends paid. With
respect to regulatory ratios, importantly, this quarter we received approval of our updated model to calculate
operational risk RWA, which resulted in a $128 billion reduction in our advanced RWA. A decline in loans drove
RWA even lower under the advanced approach. The improvement in RWA and capital improved our CET1 ratio
under advanced from [ph] 11.4% (00:18:06) to 12.7%. The decline in loans improved RWA under standardized as
well. But given the larger decline in our CET ratio under the advanced approach, standardized became our
governing approach again this quarter. Our CET1 ratio under the standardized approach improved to 11.9%,
which is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement and translates into a $35 billion capital cushion above
that requirement. Our TLAC ratios also increased and remain comfortably above our requirements.
Before leaving the balance sheet, I want to point out a couple of things with respect to loan and deposit trends.
The charts on slide 8 and 9 show a five-year trend, as we wanted to give you a longer perspective on the growth
of loans and deposits that incorporated more normal environments given the near-term disruption caused by the
pandemic.
Overall, year-over-year total loans grew 1% and the lines of business grew 3%. Commercial loans rose $67 billion
in Q1 and then declined in each of the next two quarters. Year-over-year average Global Banking loans are only
down 1%. In Consumer Banking, loans grew 5% year-over-year as the decline in higher-yielding card loans was
more than offset by the addition of PPP loans and residential mortgages.
In terms of the path forward, a few perspectives. First, our middle market utilization rate a year ago was 41%. And
it has now declined to 37%. Business banking has gone from 39% to 33%. We believe these rates are bottoming
and should begin to move higher over the next few quarters if the economy continues to grind forward.
With respect to credit card, spending and cash volumes declined materially during the first half of the year driving
balances lower. The good news is that credit card spending continued to gradually improve in Q3 but remains
significantly below pre-pandemic levels in certain categories such as travel and entertainment.
Outside of PPP loans where government forgiveness will drive declines, we remain optimistic that the larger loan
declines of the past couple of quarters are behind us, absent a resurgence in COVID cases further impacting the
economy.
On slide 9, we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points
on deposits, and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business. I will just add that
in each line of business, rate paid on deposits is at or below the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed
began raising rates. So we think our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us.
Turning to slide 10 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $10.1 billion, $10.24 billion
on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $719 million from Q2 2020 and $2.1 billion from Q3 2019. The
drop from Q2 was driven by lower loan balances and decline in interest rates across the yield curve which was
more pronounced on an average basis than on a spot basis.
Given the decline in mortgage rates during the quarter, we saw an extraordinary level of mortgage prepayments.
This resulted in higher bond premium write-offs and drove a little more than half of the decline in NII for Q2.
Compared to Q2, the increase in prepayments negatively impacted the yield on our securities by 30 basis points

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
and the overall net yield on the company by 6 basis points. The lower long-end rates also continue to impact the
reinvestment of maturing securities, lowering our NII and yield.
The other primary driver of the linked quarter decline in NII was the lower commercial and credit card balances
previously noted. While lower short-end rates did reduce the cost of both deposits and long-term debt, this [ph]
funding off (00:22:43) decline was mitigated by yields on variable rate loans also repricing lower.
We also want to point out that we saw a modest benefit in Q3 from the redeployment of some of our excess
liquidity into securities. This should aid NII more in subsequent quarters. Given the sharp decline in NII, the net
interest yield declined by 15 basis points from Q2. On the bottom right, we show the drivers of this net interest
yield decline. I already noted the bond premium impact, and you can see the other drivers on the chart.
In terms of forward NII guidance, there are a couple of caveats worth emphasizing such as rates not moving lower
than Q3 levels and the economy not taking a big step backwards from negative COVID developments, which
could drive loan demand lower again. Having said that, we believe Q3 likely will be the bottom for NII, and we are
optimistic it will move higher in 2021.
Let me provide a few thoughts on why we feel good about NII moving forward. First, commercial loan utilization
rates are at historically low levels, and with the economy expected to slowly grind forward, we are optimistic that
over the next quarter or two, you could see C&I loan demands start picking up.
As Brian noted, we are also seeing spending on credit cards slowly picking up. So with stable customer
repayment rates, we could see a seasonal lift in card balances as well. At the very least, we are not expecting the
continued large declines seen over the past two quarters in outstanding commercial or card loans.
In addition, some combination of refinancing [ph] fatigue (00:24:29) and stabilization of long-end rates should
result in less bond premium write-offs than currently impacting NII. And lastly, as I mentioned, the deployment of
cash through higher yielding securities will aid NII in the future. We believe these factors, taken together in the
near term, will mitigate the ongoing negative effects of NII on higher yielding assets maturing or paying off and
being replaced with lower yielding ones.
Turning to slide 11 and expenses, expenses this quarter were $14.4 billion, which are $1 billion higher than Q2.
First, about $600 million of the increase is from elevated litigation expense. The remaining increase is split
between higher COVID costs and merchant processing expenses, which are not higher but just accounted for
differently this quarter following the JV dissolution. The elevation in our net COVID expense was driven by costs
associated with processing unprecedented levels of claims for unemployment insurance through our commercial
card product and continued costs of supporting PPP loans. Both of these activities have revenue benefits, which
helped offset some of the costs.
With respect to expense in Q4, we don't expect to have a similar amount of litigation expense, and we don't
expect a repeat of the Q3 activity with respect to processing unemployment insurance claims. Therefore, we
believe, absent other unexpected changes, our Q4 expense number should be in the neighborhood of around
$13.7 billion.
Turning now to asset quality on slide 12, our total net charge-offs this quarter were $972 million or 40 basis points
of average loans. While net charge-offs benefited from government stimulus and loan deferral programs, it also
reflected years of adherence to our responsible growth model. The $174 million decline in net charge-offs was
driven by lower credit card losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to 249 basis points of average loans.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Provision expense of $1.4 billion, driven by a $417 million net reserve build this quarter. While total reserves grew
modestly from Q2, total loan balances declined $44 billion, increasing our allowance as a percentage of loans to
leases to 2.1%. I would also note the coverage ratio for every loan category increased in Q2, with credit card now
just north of 11%, total commercial loans at 1.8%, and CRE at 3.7%.
In terms of the process and key variables with respect to setting our reserve, which is something everyone seems
to have great interest in, we continue to include a multiple of downside scenarios. The weighting of these
scenarios produced an outlook that GDP could return to its 4Q 2019 level sometime in late 2022. The weighting
also produced an unemployment assumption of nearly 9% as we exit Q4 2020 and 7% a year later. So our
unemployment assumptions for the end of 2020 is higher than the current unemployment, and the time to return
to positive GDP improved compared to last quarter.
At the end of the day, we build commercial reserves for exposures to industries more heavily impacted by COVID
and less reserve coverage in other areas nearly unchanged as we felt, despite the macro improvement, there is
still too much uncertainty around unemployment, expiration of stimulus, the duration of the pandemic to reduce
total reserves.
On slide 13, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the
consumer front, COVID effects on asset quality continue to remain benign. Consumer net charge-offs declined
$170 million, driven by a decline in card losses. 30-day delinquencies and NPLs rose from very low levels as
deferrals ended and began to enter those metrics.
As Brian noted, consumer deferrals have materially declined, with only $9 billion remaining, which are mostly
consumer real estate-related and have strong collateral values. Credit card deferrals have declined for more than
$7 billion at the end of Q2 to around $400 million now, and more than 80% of the accounts with deferrals that
have expired have made their first payment.
Commercial net charge-offs were flat with Q2 but included higher commercial real estate losses, primarily related
to mall exposures, which were offset by lower C&I-related losses. Overall, given the environment, the asset
quality of our commercial book remains solid with 88% of exposures, excluding small business, either investment
grade or collateralized.
Our reservable criticized exposure metric continues to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this
quarter by $10 billion from Q2. It should be no surprise to you that exposures in the hotel and airline industries led
that increase. However, it's also worth noting that our commercial NPLs, which are lower rated than criticized, are
still only $2.2 billion, flat compared to Q2, and remained low at only 43 basis points of loans.
With respect to commercial real estate, which is an area of focus given COVID's potential impact on the sector,
we feel very good about our exposure and reserve coverage. Today, outstanding loans for commercial real estate
are $63 billion, which represents 7% of total loans for Bank of America and less than 25% of total equity. These
percentages are very low compared to the broader industry. 90% of these loans are either investment grade or
secured by collateral.
We have a diverse mix of exposure, led by office space at about a quarter of the CRE portfolio â€“ multifamily,
retail, hotels â€“ each just north of 10% of our CRE exposure. And our exposure is also regionally diverse with only
one area of the country representing more than 20% of the CRE loan book. Currently, we have a little more than
$400 million in this book on NPL status, and year to date we have seen less than $200 million in net charge-offs,
and we hold nearly 3.7% of allowance against these loans.

I'll just take just a moment to go a little deeper on our exposure to hotels as an example of our measured
approach over the years. Within CRE, we have about $7 billion outstanding loans related to hotel properties. That
is less than 1% of overall loans. With respect to asset quality of these loans, 85% of them are collateralized with
many having pre-COVID LTVs around 50% to 55% that can weather a meaningful price decline. And while 60%
of these loans are classified as reservable criticized, only $120 million are NPLs.
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 14. In the interest of time, I
will keep my comments brief on the lines of business and just hit the highlights on the slides we normally provide.
In the first half of the year, compared to our other segments, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted
by COVID as it bore the brunt of revenue disruption from lower rates and lower consumer spending, as well as
the need for customer assistance. It also bore a large dislocation in credit costs, not because of realized losses,
but instead from establishing reserves for losses, which are projected to materialize over the coming quarters. In
Q3, we did not add reserves, and you can see the improvement in profits versus Q2.
I would also note that expected credit losses have yet to materialize. In fact, we saw reserves in net charge-offs
decline from Q2. We also saw improvement in consumer fees as activity and account growth improved, and we
saw less demand for customer assistance through fee waivers. We also believe this quarter may be the turning
point with respect to COVID expense. As COVID costs decline, we expect to see the benefit of a more digitally
engaged customer base. We earned $2.1 billion in Consumer Banking in Q3 versus roughly $100 million in Q2
but remained well below last year's results as NII fees and expenses have all been pressured by the pandemic.
It is worth pointing out that both our rates paid and cost of deposits declined as deposits grew and we handled
more transactions, but we're more productive as a result of digital processing.
Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while loan
growth continued to be impacted by declines in credit cards.
Let's skip to Wealth Management on slide 17 and 18, and I will refer to both of those pages as I speak. Here
again, the impact of lower rates on our larger deposit book resulted in lower NII, impacting an otherwise solid
quarter with positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth.
Net income of $749 million was down 32% from Q3 2019 driven by a decline in revenue as well as higher
noninterest expense. Net income improved from Q2 on lower provision expense as reserve building subsided.
With respect to revenue, lower NII more than offset improvement in asset management fees.
Expenses increased in comparisons against both periods, driven by revenue- related expense and investments in
our sales force. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow clients as we remained a provider of
choice for affluent clients. As relative to the great work of our advisors to provide advice and guidance in these
challenging times, year-to-date, we've added nearly 17,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and more than
1,400 net new relationships in the Private Bank. Client balances rose to a record $3.1 trillion, up 6% year-over-
year driven by the rebound in markets as well as positive client flows.
Let's move to our Global Banking results on slide 19. Global Banking results continued to reflect COVID-related
impacts of both lower interest rates and higher credit costs in the quarter. Mitigating these impacts, the business
continued to produce strong investment banking results. The business earned $926 million in Q3, which included
adding $555 million to credit reserves. Net income declined $1.2 billion from Q3 2019 split relatively evenly

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
between lower revenue and higher credit costs. The decline in revenue was driven by lower NII as a result of
lower rates.
Within noninterest income, [ph] taxed-advantaged (00:37:00) leasing revenue was lower while IB fees rose. As I
mentioned, investment banking fees for the company were $1.8 billion and they were up 15% year-over-year. An
increase in noninterest expense year-over-year primarily reflected investments in the platform, including our
merchant services business. While average deposits are up nicely year-over-year, average deposit levels
declined from Q2 as we continued to lower rates and some customers chose other uses for their liquidity.
Rate paid on deposits are now lower than the levels seen at the end of 2015 just before rates began to rise.
Average loans year-over-year were modestly lower, reflecting the pay-down noted earlier. But it's worth noting
that we have seen positive trends on spreads, albeit at lower origination levels.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 22, results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from sales
and trading but also the expected decline from the robust levels of Q2. In addition, this quarter we saw an
increase in both revenue and expense associated with processing an unprecedented level of claims for
unemployment insurance. This is another important activity during this pandemic period whereby we get money in
the hands of those who need it on behalf of the states. Unfortunately, the cost, as in many other COVID-driven
activities, were quite a bit higher than the fees received. We expect both to reduce substantially next quarter.
As I usually do, I will speak about the segment's results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a loss of $116
million. So Global Markets produced $945 million of earnings in Q3, modestly higher than Q3 2019. Year-over-
year, revenue was up 13% on improved investment banking fees, higher sales and trading and the fees for
processing unemployment claims. The expense increase was driven by higher claims process costs as well as
higher brokers clearing and execution costs associated with higher activity in Asia. Sales and trading contributed
$3.3 billion to revenue, increasing 4% year-over-year, driven by a 6% improvement in equities and a 3%
improvement in FICC. The improvement in FICC results was driven by performance in mortgage and FX, while
the strength in equities was driven by client activity in Asia.
Finally, on slide 24, we show All Other, which reported a profit of $296 million. Compared to Q3 2019, the
improvement in net income is driven primarily by the prior year $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge associated
with our merchant servicing JV. Compared to Q2 2020, [audio gap] (00:39:56) reflects the $700 million tax
adjustment associated with our UK deferred tax asset. The tax expense improvement versus linked quarter was
mostly offset by 2Q's $700 million gain from the sale of mortgages and the higher litigation expense in Q3. In Q3,
the tax rate reflected the benefit of the tax adjustments as well as the ongoing benefit of tax-advantaged
investments.
In Q4, absent unusual items, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 10%, reflecting the impact of tax
credits relative to pre-tax income. And just a reminder, these tax-advantaged investments, which are driven by our
commitment to ESG, also result in pre-tax partnership losses, both in consolidated other income, and these
partnership losses are normally seasonally high in Q4.
Okay. With that, let's jump to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line
is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So you've historically been incredibly stable in trading. And again, you are this quarter. But
I guess I have a question to rehash on. During times like this, you have some peers that will have bigger spikes,
and then they'll come back down to earth at other times. And I'm just curious if you could talk about, you're steady
but you're not seeing the same spikes. Is that your risk tolerance? Is it a CCAR stress testing thing? Is it a mix of
business? And is it conscious, meaning are you investing too close on [ph] gaps (00:42:03)? Just curious if you
could talk about that from the market's perspective. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. Well, look, again our sales and trading results were solid, with total revenue up 4% year-over-year. Equities
is up 6%. FICC is up 2%. We had no days with trading losses again this quarter. If you kind of look at â€“ I don't
really like to talk about competitors, but every competitor is going to have a different business mix and many of
our competitors, I will say, take more risk. In one quarter or another, clearly, that can create some differences in
relative performance. We don't really focus that much on individual quarters, but instead, we look at results over
longer time periods.
And as noted, sales and trading is up 22% year to date. I would also note that we're gaining share, we think, in
equities and other parts of our markets business, and we certainly have gained share in investment banking. And
there's been quarters where we've done better, I mean, than some of our peers. Go back to Q1, when you'll see
in equities where we basically did better than all our peers. So we're staying focused on the medium to long term.
We're investing in the business, and we're taking share.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Fair enough. Maybe just one follow-up on â€“ you noted, obviously, loan demand stabilized, trough quarter for NII,
don't expect to add to reserves, deferrals mostly over, and you have a $35 billion capital cushion. I'm curious what
you feel is a more natural number. At some point, we'll get off by that suspension. So what's a more natural
number for your capital cushion? And what might be your intentions on what to do with that excess? Because it
feels like organic growth, you're going to make more money than you can file into organic growth for a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
That's a good list to work with in terms of citing the things. And, yes, we are generating twice our dividend or
more, have been for every quarter, even when we put up the reserves, even while the rate structure hit. So trough
quarter for NII last quarter, expenses coming down, built the reserves. We'd expect that we'll get through the
stress test and then we'll start to go into capital redeployment as we did before.

And our general goal is to run about 100 basis points over the minimum. So for us, that's 10.5, which is another
reason why the mix of business is so important to us that you'd referenced earlier is remember, we had a stress
capital buffer that was 2.5%, and we didn't use all of it. But so we got plenty of cushion here from an operational
basis in terms of the ability to use capital management once we're free and clear.

Operator: And we can move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe one for Brian. Given the pressure in the industry and your scale advantages, is there
an opportunity here to kind of press your advantage a little bit and try to accelerate market share and sort of what
that might mean for expenses if you did?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, and look, I think we've been able to push market share. So if you look at the FDIC data, I think we're up 60
or 70 basis points in aggregate deposit market share June 30 to June 30. And everybody had the benefit for the
monetary policy. But what we watch is where the market share is going to stick to the ribs. So think about it in
terms of adding commercial bankers, which we've added. Think about it in terms of entering new markets and
branches.
This year, we've entered several new markets. If you look at the deposits in these markets that we've been open
a while, they're $50 million per branch, moving to $100 million per branch. And think about the Wealth
Management business adding financial advisors. So we just keep driving that total. And if you think about â€“ we
have $1.7 trillion in deposits, $800 billion plus in Consumer, but a lot of other people forget that we also have a
personal business in GWIM with $250 billion plus in deposits. So we have pressed our advantage.
And in Consumer, those that have been around the company, we reposition the Consumer business from [ph]
60% (00:46:38) primary checking to 90% plus. And that's a million new checking accounts year to year, or
800,000, 900,000, something like that in a year where we've been shut down for a couple quarters from some of
the activity at the branches. And that's strong performance. We're pressing that all the time. The magic has been
we've been able to manage expenses between $13 billion, $13.5 billion a quarter. Now you've got to add the
merchant to it [ph] to the $13.7 billion (00:47:05) and still invest at that rate.
Look at that page 4 on the digital growth. It's very strong. Our Zelle [indiscernible] (00:47:13) with 30% all the
Zelle transactions. Erica, [indiscernible] (00:47:15) and then life plan this quarter, we put out a new product that
you can do your own financial plan, and a half million customers in a couple weeks. So across the board in each
element of the franchise investing $3 billion in technology.
So we're pressing the advantage organically every day, and you're seeing that come out. Our deposit market
share across the board has grown, and our loan share where we compete has continued to grow. And our GTS
business has continued to grow. And as Paul said, our investment banking has grown, and we're keeping driving
it.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
So that's helpful. And so you feel comfortable that you can still, I mean, add the $200 million to the $13 billion, the
$13.5 billion, so $13.2 billion, $13.7 billion? You still feel comfortable doing all that and keeping expenses in that
range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, and that's this operational excellence platform. If you look at whatever page that was, look at all those
quarters and you go back even before that. And think of all the investments we've [ph] made and make. And
(00:48:12) I think that's three years we show you maybe. So think of $9 billion to $10 billion in technology
development, code development, new initiatives in that period of time. And expenses stayed relatively flat. Think
about redeploying probably 300 to 400 or 500 new branches across that three to four years in markets we've
never been. Think about refurbishing. We've done 300 or 400 branches this year so far. We've opened into new
market, et cetera. So just this quarter, just this literal quarter, we opened 13 branches in new market. So we're
pressing our advantage.
And the board asked me, and we'd have the discussions with our major shareholders, could you press it harder?
And the answer is if I talk to marketing people, sure, they'd want to spend more money on marketing, but I think
we spend enough to do the trick and drive it in a way that it'd stick to the ribs.

Thanks for the time. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the points you were making, Paul, earlier about the cash and
the redeployment into securities. And I just wanted to get a sense as to for 4Q, how much of a NIM uplift do you
think you're going to get from that?
And then what percentage of cash have you used already? What is going to be guiding you on how much more to
use here? And is there a limit for how much cash you're willing to redeploy into securities?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, sure. So in the third quarter, we deployed about $100 billion of our cash into mortgage-backed securities
and Treasuries over the third quarter. And our weighted average basis between the Treasuries and mortgage-
backed securities, that probably produced a lift relative to cash of about close to a percentage point on what we
deployed. You didn't see a lot of that come through in Q3 because of the timing of those purchases throughout
the quarter. You'll see more of that impact in Q4.
With respect to future deployment, we have some firepower left. I hesitate to give you a number, but call it maybe
another $100 billion-ish. I'm not telling you we're going to deploy all of that in the fourth quarter. We're continuing
to assess deposits and we'll likely continue to deploy more cash, very likely to continue to deploy more cash into
securities moving forward, but no answer right yet exactly how much. The size and the pace of that will be
influenced by a number of judgments including things like loan demand and customer deposit behavior, and we'll
also balance the mix of purchases as we assess the trade-offs between capital, liquidity and earnings.
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And the 1 percentage point you're talking about is a yield lift on the portfolio versus cash?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
That is â€“ if you compare what we're buying, mortgage-backed securities, Treasuries, to what we were earning in
cash or repo, the pickup in yield on that investment is a little less than 1%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I got it. All right. And then maybe if you could speak a little bit to, both yourself and Brian, to
the discussion around the C&I loan utilization. And I get that we're at a historic low or close to the lows in
utilization, but what is it that you're seeing in your customer discussions that gives you an expectation that you
could see that start to lift in 4Q and into 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So what we see is it just hasn't been going down. It kind of ran down throughout the second quarter and the first
quarter, everyone panic-borrowed, people drawing their lines and then it ran down. And so some of these
companies are making more cash flow than they've ever made, and so what you're starting to see is a couple
things.
One is in areas like auto, retail, dealers and stuff, the inventories are going to have to build or else they're going to
have nothing to sell. So they'll build those back up. You're seeing it in suppliers of parts and things. They're
building their inventories because they're seeing more final demand on the products that sustain, and I think that's
the key.
So it's more just talking to people and seeing that frankly that they brought it down about as far as they can from
sort of the day-to-day operational basis. When you start to think of $50 million and under revenue companies
running the numbers that Paul gave you which is what we call business banking, they can't get it much lower than
that because they're paying their payrolls and doing their things, and so they're going to start to build back up as
15

they start to expand to meet their client demands. And so that's what gives us confidence, just the conversations
that we've had with them. And talking to them in these deep reviews we've done, it's been clear that they're
feeling better that the core demand from May to June to July to August to September picks up.
The only big question when we're wrong on all this in terms of loan balance is really in the high end and who has
access to markets and how deep that goes in the middle markets, which -we make fees on the investment
banking side but that can move loan balances around as you well know [ph] Betsy. (00:53:37)

Brian T. Moynihan A

Hey, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. This is a follow-up to you guys pressing your advantage. I mean, it's good news, bad news. Good news is
you're growing households. Your deposits for the corporation are [ph] on course (00:54:03) year-over-year. Your
digital banking is growing. So that's great. And your [ph] award is (00:54:09) your NII has gotten crushed, right?
So it's a short-term versus long-term trade-off.
So as you look at an environment with lower rates for longer, as you acquire these customers, have you changed
your assumptions for lifetime value, because I assume you eventually want to monetize the benefits of these
relationships, but it's just not happening yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I think, Mike, you have to think about it two ways. One is for the new customers coming on bringing us $100
billion in incremental checking deposits year-over-year, that is money coming on at basically zero that you can
redeploy, as Paul said. So there's a value to that incrementally to the company. The question is when you have
that quick fall-down of rates that we had, you have to kind of get underneath to come out the other side, as you
well know.
But look, the value of the deposit franchise is represented by having the core household relationships and that's
where you see the things move forward. So what are we seeing? We're seeing a rebound in our auto lending.
We're seeing a rebound in our card lending. Those are coming because we have the core relationships that are
digitally inactive, 50% of the sales are coming digitally, and that helps us grow.
And then you think about just on the consumer, look â€“ if you look at page 15 on the investment side, you're seeing
that build up by $40 billion year-over-year, $20 billion linked quarter. So that materialized the balance. And the
good news is you've looked at the fee structure across the platforms and the different things, you're seeing the
fees start to come back up, which is just core activity. So we're at â€“ we only have $225 million in total quarterly
16


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
deposit interest costs. So it can only go from $225 million to zero. There's not much left in it. It was $1.6 billion, I
think, last year this quarter.
So we've brought that down and now we have just got to grow the volume back up and you're seeing that start to
happen. And that's what gives Paul comfort [ph] from the full projections. (00:55:58) And it's the depth of
relationship. It's not any single product as you well know. And we're pressing the advantage because, frankly,
even in a low rate environment, more core deposit customers, more core checking accounts and deposits in
addition to our Wealth Management business in GWIM, more GTS business, we'll make more money on. [ph] You
make â€“ in a twist (00:56:20) of rates in a given quarter, but just think back, we had this discussion in the mid-
2013, 2014, 2015, you saw the earnings come up even before the rates moved.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Are there ways to â€“ we know this is the lynchpin to a customer relationship. It's just getting value [ph] today
(00:56:42) for that relationship. And you are mentioning the different products. Is there a way to think about
charging more fees or something if you have a low rate environment like this? Again, just getting your money's
worth for all the effort you put in to gather these new households.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, well, I think â€“ not penalty fees, clearly, Mike, because that just is a bad customer experience because the
other thing is the attrition rate in the book has dropped very low because of the high quality customer experience
our team delivers and it gives you the permission to do more with them. So penalty fees, I think, are not the way
to go but core account fees for the structures are there.
But the reality is that most of the â€“ our preferred book, which is 80% of the consumer deposits by definition, is
way above any minimum requirement for fees. And so you've got the volume. You're getting 80% of consumer
deposits in a book that was only about 20% of the customers. So you make it up in your expenses and your
operating capacity there, and that's how you ultimately make it up even in a low rate environment is just the sheer
â€“ we have 4,300 branches in this franchise, Mike, in 1999, we had 4,800, just to give you a sense.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I wanted to follow up on expenses. You talked about $13.7 billion in the fourth quarter, and I just
wanted to â€“ trying to figure out, is that still an elevated number from COVID? Because if you annualize it and you
add the 1Q seasonal bump, you're kind of, call it, mid $55 billion range for next year, which feels high but I wanted
to give you guys a chance to address that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think the $13.7 billion â€“ the roughly $13.7 billion for 4Q, that probably includes net COVID expenses of
$300 million to $400 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. As you think about the timing of that $300 billion to $400 billion (sic) [$300 million to $400 million]
(00:59:05) coming off, I guess it can be tricky. But what are you assuming at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
$300 million to $400 million, right, I mean $300 million to $400 million per quarter in the fourth quarter. It was
higher this quarter. But in the fourth quarter, baked into that number is $300 million to $400 million of net COVID
expenses. So that will come off over 2021. And we'll get more of it at the end of the year than we will in the
beginning of the year but it will ratably come down. I would expect maybe half of that to [ph] being â€“ per quarter to
being that (00:59:42) on a full-year basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately following up on net interest income, you talk about it moving higher in 2021. I assume
that's on a linked quarter basis. And obviously, there's some day count challenges in the [ph] first (00:59:59)
quarter. But maybe just elaborate a bit on the outlook for net interest income for next year based on the
assumptions that you have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. Look, without providing any specific guidance, I'll give you a few thoughts on next year. Obviously, the lower
reinvestment yields are expected to continue and that's going to impact NII. But that headwind early in the year
should be offset by the deployment of the cash into securities. And then by the middle of the year, we're hopeful
that loan growth will be a tailwind as the economy recovers. So we think NII should move forward and up from
here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So if I [ph] work on that math and (01:00:37) think about, again, to adjust for the day count and some of those
nuances, would your expectation be that net interest income dollars in 3Q of next year will be higher than this
year?

Hi. Paul, two NII questions. Just near term, so it sounds like you might be expecting a little bit of lift net of all the
factors you talked about in NII in the fourth quarter or kind of flattish, up a little. Just kind of what's the near-term
outlook on NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So the near-term outlook is, as I said, it's going to be we think at least flat, and we're optimistic it's going to
be up.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A

So we think we're at the low point [ph] 3% (01:01:48) for NII. We've got the ones in reinvestment on securities and
we've got the lower average loan balances, given where we're ending this quarter on loan balances. But we think
those headwinds are going to be offset by the deployment of the excess cash that we've done and will probably
continue to do in the fourth quarter. So at least flat and, optimistic, up.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then one nitpick here. In the other income category, there's a net loss in non-interest income of minus
$250 million. So you mentioned tax advantaged investments and other things, is that kind of what we should
expect going forward and you're getting the benefit in the tax rate but this other income kind of runs at a little bit of
a loss, or are there some other issues there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. No, I think I would expect that. I think other income's going to bounce around quarter to quarter but it
should, on average, be down a couple hundred million, given as you said, the investment in our renewable energy
products and other ESG efforts, which create partnership losses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Okay. So that's kind of a new run rate [ph] first half (01:03:29)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And remember, in the fourth quarter, those partnership losses are always higher. So think maybe a couple
hundred million higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. More than the $250 million this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, but we get the benefit in the tax line throughout the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah, 10% for the fourth quarter and â€“ do you have an idea of like tax rate for an annual basis going forward with
this new arrangement?

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I don't have an expectation for next year to share with you, but the fourth quarter, absent some unusual items,
10%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And I would just remind everybody that these tax advantaged investments are things we're doing to help society.
We're talking about low income housing, we're talking about wind and solar. These are things that are part of our
ESG effort.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. We're a melioristic company but on the other hand, we're also doing it because it's a good business for us
and helps us generate â€“ the benefits, net of the cost of losses, are positive to the company's earnings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we can move next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on just your expectations for
just how the loss cycle is going to evolve. Paul, I believe you mentioned that you wouldn't expect losses to really
start moving up until midyear next year. And [ph] I know (01:05:00) as we start to evaluate whether or not and
how much stimulus we get versus what we've already gotten baked in the cake, just how are you expecting to see
both the consumer and the commercial side traject as we move forward? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, sure. So, look, regarding net charge-offs, I think we've covered it, but in consumer, given the lack of
significant delinquencies we've seen so far, even on those customers who have come off deferral, and given the
fact that net charge-offs don't occur without bankruptcy until 180 days past due, it's just not likely we're going to
see consumer net charge-offs would show up until kind of mid-2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. If you go back and think about it, what we thought was going to happen, third quarter this year pushed out,
going back to the first quarter when we looked at it. And the second quarter, we looked at, we pushed out further.
21

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
The third quarter, we pushed out further. So it keeps pushing out based on â€“ frankly, the characteristics of our
consumers are stronger than the characteristics generally in the United States. And the characteristics of the
United States are they're consumers are doing better, because of all the things you mentioned, than the
unemployment statistic would indicate in models. And so it just pushed it out, but it's now to the second half of
next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, and I guess I'm just trying to wonder...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
[indiscernible] (01:06:25)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...sorry. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Remember, the near-term path of charge-offs is going to be driven by delinquency roll and things like that, what's
delinquent at the end of this quarter. And as Paul said, the 30-day delinquencies are down year-over-year, and
mortgages and cards and things like that, it's down as a percent and down as a dollar amount and down as a
percent on a smaller balance. So the credit quality's been strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And you made the point about not being quite clear yet on if you should release reserves just given the
uncertainties, I guess how much is future stimulus a part of that equation? What do you look for to kind get that
comfort zone that you can say â€“ I know you said the builds are done, but just in terms of starting to utilize and feel
comfortable that you can let even more of those reserves kind of flow back into capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So a stimulus plan would help the unemployed. The businesses are still struggling to get their business capacity â€“
get their business utilization up, those obvious businesses you all know, and [ph] in states and towns (01:07:35)
so they don't have further reduction in budgets and/or â€“ schools and other things, hospitals, all these people have
been heavily affected. Stimulus affecting those would help all these â€“ speed up the pace of the [ph] investments
(01:07:49) coming down, quite frankly. Right now there â€“ right now that's not baked in, as Paul said earlier, but
stimulus coming in would move us further and you'd see the reserves come out further because of the lifetime
expectation of losses would be lower. It's kind of the way it works [ph] for losses. (01:08:08)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
All right. Thanks very much.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Operator: And we will move next to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
President, Portales Partners, LLC
Yeah, two quick questions. In your guidance on no more reserve build, I'm trying to make sure I understand that
because you've also talked about the possibility of loan growth. So at the very least, you'll cover charge-offs, but
we also provide for loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We would. But just think about a couple percentage of loan growth given the level of reserving wouldn't change it
dramatically. So if we had fast loan growth, which I don't think the economy is going to support in the near term,
we'd have to grow it faster. But that would be a high-quality problem to have to build reserves for loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
President, Portales Partners, LLC
Sure. Sure. And then the second question is can you give some color on the pipeline for investment banking and
what that looks like versus the second quarter or the year-ago fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, the pipeline looks solid for investment banking. Again, the second quarter was a record quarter for us, and
the third quarter was the second-best quarter for us. So â€“ and investment banking's normally down sequentially
third quarter to fourth quarter. I don't think you can expect to see the same type of volume in the fourth quarter
that we saw in the second quarter or perhaps the third quarter. But the pipeline looks solid and we're even seeing
some M&A pick up or at least from a discussion standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And Tom Montag and I have been very pleased with the work that Matthew Koder's done with that team over the
last year-and-a-half or so since he took over, and just driving great coverage, driving great connectivity to our
middle market business and the fees there are continuing to grow. And so they've done a â€“ he's done a very good
job with the management team in that business and we'd expect him to keep making progress.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, we've gone from â€“ just in middle market alone, we've gone from fourth to second in a year with 9.5%
market share. We talked about market share gains earlier.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
President, Portales Partners, LLC
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the program over to Brian
Moynihan for any closing remarks.
