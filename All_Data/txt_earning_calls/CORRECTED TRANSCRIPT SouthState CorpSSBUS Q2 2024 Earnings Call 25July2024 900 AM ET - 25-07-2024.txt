Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Thank you, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. It felt like SouthState was firing on nearly all
cylinders in the second quarter. We saw the long-anticipated inflection of our net interest margin, non-interest
income was up, expenses were well-controlled and earnings per share were up 15% from last quarter. On the
balance sheet, deposits are still a challenge, but loans grew better than forecast and asset quality is in good
shape, with only 5 basis points in charge-offs.
The most impactful event of the second quarter was; obviously, the announcement of the Independent Financial
transaction. We spent the month of June in town hall meetings with employees in Dallas, Denver, Austin and
Houston, and David and his team were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. They're all terrific. With no branch
overlap and no change to the geographic leadership structure, it makes this much easier to integrate and for our
bankers to keep their focus on serving their clients and building the bank.
We've already filed the proxy and we've scheduled for the shareholder vote for next month. We also filed the
regulatory applications on July 1. So things are progressing on schedule. We walked through the strategic
rationale when we announced the deal in May. We're expanding into great markets. In fact, there're some of the
only markets in the country that match the demographic growth profile of our current markets, both from people
migration and income migration. We also talked about the financial power with 27% earnings per share accretion.
But I want to take a minute and drill down on how we're thinking about the deal from a capital management
perspective. As an industry, we're on the back end of the fastest increase of interest rates in decades. Our
industry currently suffers from loans and investments that are under-earning their potential because they're not
yielding current market rates. That's a negative overhang that will last for years. But the positive is the industry
enjoys the benefit of strong capital ratios.
So, the question for every bank management team is how to utilize surplus capital to reposition the balance sheet
and unlock the earnings potential of these assets rather than waiting years. Many of our peers have chosen to
execute a bond swap, and that's fine. But a bond swap never got us particularly excited as a capital management
strategy. We looked at it as a dollar-for dollar-trade. You invest a dollar of capital and you get a dollar of earnings,
but you accelerate the timing of the cash flows. Again, that's fine from a financial engineering perspective, but it
feels to us like a dollar-for-dollar trade.
What we're doing with Independent is a more powerful use of capital. Just like a bond swap, we're unlocking the
earnings power of the bonds at Independent Financial. But it's not just the bonds; we're unlocking the earnings
potential of their entire loan portfolio. So including both loans and investments, it's about a $17 billion interest rate
swap on all earning assets. But here's the key, rather than a dollar-for-dollar trade, the thing that makes this
different is that we're utilizing the SouthState valuation and currency advantage simultaneously with the
investment of capital, which makes the swap much more powerful as a capital management approach.
Layering both the normal economies of scale we gain in the transaction, plus the currency advantage and we see
this as a far, far better use of capital than a Bonilla bond swap. All $17 billion of earning assets moves to market
rates, and the rates are instantly locked [ph] independent (05:45) net interest margin opens wide, and the only
rate movement going forward will be deposit rates. As we move into a period of likely lower rates, SouthState
should benefit as a more liability sensitive balance sheet with Independent.

I want to thank David and Dan Brooks, Dan Strodel and the entire Independent team for making us feel so
welcome and for their enthusiasm of what we're building together. I'll turn it back over to Will to provide more color
on the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Thanks, John. Total revenue of $425 million for the quarter was a bit better than forecasted, with net interest
income of $350 million and non-interest income of $75 million. That total revenue number was up $10 million from
Q1 on an equal day count. Our NIM of 3.44% rose 3 basis points and was in line with our expectations as deposit
cost increases slowed to 6 basis points at the lower end of our 5 to 10 basis point guidance for a cost of total
deposits of 1.80 basis points for the quarter. And as loan yields increased 9 basis points from the prior quarter,
also within our guidance of 7 to 10 basis points.
I'll note what appears to be something of an inflection point. This is the first quarter since Q4 of 2022 where our
improvement in loan yields exceeded our increase in cost of deposits. That brings our total cumulative deposit
beta to 34% and our cumulative loan beta to 39%. Confirming our expectations, our deposit mix shift appears to
have slowed. In fact, for the quarter, average DDA balances were up slightly versus Q1, and the average mix of
DDAs to total deposits was unchanged from Q1's 28.5%. Steve will give some color on our future margin
guidance in the Q&A.
Non-interest income was up $4 million from Q1, a bit better than we expected. NIE excluding non-recurring items
of $242 million was up $1 million from Q1 and moderately above Q2 of 2023 levels. Looking ahead, the remainder
of the year, we have merit increases for most of the bank that were effective July 1. So compensation expense
will increase. There are also some project and related expenses we expect to hit in the second half of the year.
So NIE in Q3 and Q4 is still likely to be in the $250 million range. As always, NIE is somewhat dependent on
expense items that vary with revenue.
Our $4 million in provision expense essentially matched the quarter's net charge-offs, leaving the total reserve
levels flat. And when combined with loan growth caused the total reserve to loans to decline 3 basis points to 157.
NPLs were up $21 million centered in one loan where we have guarantors with substantial liquid capacity and
where we expect to resolve this credit favorably. Past dues and payment performance improved and are as
strong as we've seen in recent memory. And we continue to expect that we will not see significant losses in the
loan portfolio based upon current forecasts.
Lastly, on the balance sheet front, loan growth of 7% annualized brought year-to-date growth to a 5% annualized
rate and deposits were flat with Q1 levels with ending deposits down slightly and average deposits up
approximately 1%. Capital improved with our TCE ratio growing to 8.4%, our CET1 to 12.1% and our TBV per
share ending at $47.90.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question comes from the line of Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please ask your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to get a sense on, just the loan growth expectations. I know you guys had previously talked about
kind of mid-single digits. I think this quarter was a little bit better than what I was looking for. Just any sort of
thoughts that you guys have and but you can just talk about kind of, from the business perspective, what your
customers are telling you. Would you expect to see, assuming everything works out with the election, the
regulatory side, maybe, is there any pent-up demand? Just trying to get a sense for what customer activity looks
like. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Good morning, Michael. It's John. Yeah, you're right. We referenced about mid-single-digit loan growth
guidance early in the year and really that's what we're tracking. We've done about 5% loan growth, a little stronger
in the second quarter. I think last quarter, Michael, we mentioned that our pipelines had grown significantly
starting in November of last year and that pipeline growth translated into loan production growth in the second
quarter. Our loan production grew from $1.3 billion in the first to about $2 billion in the second quarter. So, it's
about 50% increase in loan production.
The growth is really broad based. The biggest contributor we're seeing is C&I credits, largely middle market
companies and we're seeing the strongest growth out of the Carolinas. And in the last year, we benefited from the
funding of construction loans that were made in earlier in 2021 and 2022. That tailwind probably abates here in
the coming quarters. So we may lose some of that benefit. But pipelines are currently stable, so we think our
current guidance is still appropriate. But as always, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But the payoffs of the
wild card, they've been historically low last few quarters, but we're starting to see some multifamily sales activities.
So, payoffs might increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. And then, I am just switching to credit. You guys for a bunch of quarters built the reserves pretty
meaningfully. You did have some modest upward migration understanding it's off of very low levels, but the
reserve did come down. The provision was I think much less than me and others were looking for. Can you just

discuss some of the puts and takes and maybe what drove the increase in the earlier stage, special mention, in
the substandard categories? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Michael. It's John. So, I think we talked about a few quarters ago as the yield curve increases and
rates rise, we'll probably see a migration and a more of a normalization in particularly commercial real estate
loans and that's kind of manifested itself; although, it's slowing down in the last quarter or two. But it's primarily a
rising rate story. I think our culture, as you know to be is one that's quick to downgrade and slow to upgrade, but
as we talked to the credit team that are analyzing these loans, they don't see material loss content and we're not
having really any significant payment performance issues. I think Will mentioned it in his opening remarks, past
dues are only 21 basis points and we're all focused on office, but the office past dues are only 22 basis points and
if you take a step back, past dues in all commercial real estates, loans are only 6 basis points.
So, I think as we move through this rate cycle, we've got lots of equity, strong guarantors, we'll upgrade loans
accordingly as debt service coverage has improved, but we don't see loss content [indiscernible] (14:28)
particularly concerned at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah, Michael. It's Will. I'll maybe comment on provisioning CECL is always a difficult and dangerous thing to
predict. But, the theory behind it, of course, is that you provision in advance, recognize losses in advance. And if
look at our build over the last eight quarters, it's up about a $171 million provision expense net of charge-offs.
And so, it's possible moving ahead, if you start to see improvements in economic forecasts, we and the industry
have probably followed the same practice would potentially see reserve levels continue to come down, even in
some cases you might see some folks charge-offs tick up at the same time. So, you know, CECL is a forward-
looking model, it does incorporate some other qualitative factors associated with things in your portfolio. But if
economic forecasts improve from here, I wouldn't necessarily see our reserve moving up at all from where it is
today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the color and maybe just one last one from me. I saw that you guys filed a fixed
income in your presentation and it looks like IBTX, to the extent you can comment, had some sub-debt that's
maturing in 2024. Can you just talk about why this presentation was filed? And then, you know, any sort of
comments as to what the sub-debt, do they expect that to just pay that down or just any comments you can give?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. All I say on that, Michael, is that IBTX as a standalone entity has debt maturing shortly and they may or
may not be opportunistic in the market to refinance it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. I'll step back. Thanks.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
It was great to see the margin come right in line with your guidance. Wanted to see what you're thinking about the
back half of the year, particularly as we push the likelihood of cuts back to the -- likely to December. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure, Catherine. This is Steve. It's probably a longer answer than you're ready for, but I thought maybe I would
spend a little time on this because in April, just the headline is there are really no real changes to our guidance.
But we did have, as we said, a material announcement in May that we're thinking about the transaction with IBTX
and it's 27% accretive. So, it is a bit of a game changer as we kind of think about post the end of this year.
So, I guess the first point is there's really no change to our guidance. I think we said 340 to 350 for the full year
and that's sort of where we are. Let me kind of try to build a bridge from where we are and kind of where we're
modeling we're headed. And, it's really the three assumptions around interest earning assets at $41 billion for
2024. That's no change. There's nothing changed there. You know, our rate forecast that we talked about in April
is the same as the Moody's baseline. It was two cuts in 2024 and four cuts in 2025. So, that has not changed.
And then the third big assumption is around deposit beta. We're 34% on the way up and we're modeling on a
standalone company as 20% on the way down and then as a pro forma company with IBTX, 25% on the way
down. So for the standalone company for us, we would expect NIM to be flat in the third quarter with the loan
yields and funding costs offsetting each other. And if we get a rate set in September, as the market seems to
indicate, we would expect a 3 to 5 basis points improvement in the fourth quarter. And then for each rate cut
thereafter, what we talked about before, we would expect the 3 to 5 basis points NIM increase for each of those
rate cuts.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Now, as we think about adding IBTX into the company, when IBTX closes, which we still expect that to happen in
the first quarter, I'm not sure early or late, but we would expect a 10 to 15 basis point increase in the margin run
rate for us as we mark-to-market the fixed rate loans and fixed rate securities of IBTX.
So to just kind of conclude, as we kind of think forward from the bridge from here to the end of 2025, so by the
fourth quarter of 2025, with these rate assumptions and our modeling assumptions that we announced during the
merger that we would approximately have about $50 billion in loan, we'd have about $55 billion in deposits and
our exiting fourth quarter NIM would be in the 3.75% to 3.85% range. And then, as we think about 2026, if
Moody's baseline is correct, there's three more rate cuts in 2026, which would add to our margin that same 3% to
5% basis points. So, the area would be in 2026 get in the 3.90s% potentially.
You know, if we don't get -- if we get fewer cuts than 6 that we're expecting, we would expect margin continue to
expand, but it would be lower by 2 to 4 basis points for each rate cut that we don't get if it's less than 6 rate cuts.
So hopefully, you know, that kind of helps your modeling as you think about us on a standalone through the end
of the year and then us together with IBTX through 2025. Just two other comments on that, as we think about
liability sensitivity in a low rate environment, our CRE floating rate loans percentage is 30%. Post, it'll be 27%. So
little less floating in a post-IBTX world and then our deposits, as we mentioned, our beta was 20% in a pre-IBTX
and post-IBTX would be 25%. So, that all kind of adds up to all of those assumptions to get to that guide. So, I
hope that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, that was awesome, Steve, as always. And one thing, you mentioned last quarter that you still thought that
before we get to cuts that your deposit cost would probably peak somewhere in the mid-180s. It feels like were
178 now, so nearing that. Is that still how you're thinking about the deposit cost peak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yes. No change that the interest rate forecast didn't change. This quarter, we were 180. I think that's what's in our
press release with our deposit cost. We still expect that to peak in the mid-180s probably in the third quarter
[indiscernible] (21:48).

So, fees came in stronger this quarter as well. So just wanted to get an update on what you're thinking about fees
going forward. I believe the range is kind of that 55 to 65 basis points, but I wonder if that's a 55 to 60 basis
points, but has that changed at all given the strength you've seen so far?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Thanks, Brandon. This is Steve. Yes. You know, we showed a slide on page 29, but our fee income is just
sort of a trend line on our fee income of $75 million or 67 basis points on assets, yeah, which was higher than our
55 to 60 basis point guide. We did have interest on an IRS tax refund payment that added about $5 million to the
second quarter totals.
So, if you kind of, I would say that basically there's not a lot of change to this guidance based on the interest rate
forecast and the first cut that happened late in the third quarter. We would sort of expect that NII average assets
to be maybe in that 55 to 65 basis point range. Before it starts climbing, you know, as they start cutting rates and
the capital markets businesses start coming back mortgage maybe in that 60 to 70 basis point range maybe
toward the first of next year. And then, as we look at the pre-look and as we, run rate perspective, when we add
IBTX, which has a little less non-interest income, we would expect NII to average assets to be somewhere in that
50 to 55 basis points combined range as we get a full run rate after close.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
All right. That's -- that's very helpful. And then, John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that your deposit
environment is still challenging and deposits declined on a spot basis quarter-over-quarter. So, could you just
further elaborate on kind of what you're seeing in the deposit environment and kind of the expectations for growth
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Brandon, this is Steve. I think where we are in the cycle is kind of right at the end of a rate pausing cycle.
And I remember this from other cycles that liquidity is kind of hard until the rate cutting cycle goes into place. And
we're trying to manage, obviously yield deposit cost with growth and right now, we're having the ability to fund our
loans with our deposits and our securities balances.
So, I would expect that I'll call it at a rate cutting environment that, liquidity typically comes back and money
market funds, there's alternatives and other things. As people are in the treasuries, they typically go back in the
bank deposits or some portion of it. So, if in this environment we've been really focused on managing our own
capital and trying to remix the balance sheet without growing the overall balance sheet and the overall funding
structure and try to remix within that. So, I would expect the team certainly focused on it, but we're also focused
on PPNR. And so we're trying to balance those two things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just lastly, a clarification point on the NIM guidance. What is your embedded mix, deposit mix
expectations or assumptions within that with, especially for non-interest bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. So, our non-interest bearing in this quarter is around 28%. I think it rounded to 28% last quarter. So I think
we're -- things sort of a flattening off on a standalone basis. IBTX is a little less than that. But I think they saw a
nice yield moderation there too, so I wouldn't expect there to be a huge mix shift from here absent, a rate change

or something like that. But right now, we've seen the sort of the trends and I think maybe it was down 40 or 30
basis points, but hardly sitting around at all.

This is around where we were pre-COVID. So, you know, it's hard to predict when the environment -- we went
through was different. But this is pretty close to where we were pre-COVID, Brandon.

All right. Thanks for taking my questions.

Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Will, you made some comments, I think, regarding your construction projects,
[indiscernible] (00:27:08) you're going to maybe see that moderate or decline a little bit. I'm curious, as it relates to
completed projects, are you seeing any extension in terms of dwell times on your balance sheet before maybe
there is a sale transaction or before the projects move to the secondary market or the permanent market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. You know, in some segments we're seeing them to be a little slower to lease up self-storage particularly.
What we're seeing a little slowness there. But on the flip side, Gary, we are seeing the capital markets start to fall
and seeing more transactions in multifamily. Just in the last month, we saw a multifamily project trade at a, I think
was a 5.25 of cap rate. So that tells you that there's activity out there and the ability to transact business and get
these projects off the books.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Appreciate the color there. And then, I was just curious about the intra-quarter volatility on the DDA
balance. It seemed particularly larger score of the average balance, almost $2 billion above the March 31 or 6/30
balance, so just curious about that intra-quarter volatility and how to think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Gary, our DDAs as a percent of overall deposits were really flat on an average basis Q1 to Q2. I'm not sure
I may have misunderstood your question.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I guess I'm just querying the delta between -- I've got your average DDA for the quarter at over $12 billion versus
about $10.3 billion at quarter end and about $10.5 billion as of March 31. So, I am just curious of that intra-quarter
volatility of average versus the period end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. I think you may have a blip in your model. We got -- the average for Q1 was $11,957 million and Q2 was
$12,171 million. So, yeah. And year ago June [ph] $13,333 million (29:12) per average non-interest in the quarter
two. Maybe [indiscernible] (29:20).

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
No, I've got those numbers, guys. Again, I was just trying to be -- we could -- I can talk to you offline about it. It's
not a major factor here. Thanks.

John C. Corbett A

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bishop of Hovde Group. Please go ahead.

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
A question, you know, there's obviously been a lot of argument around the commercial real estate space within
the markets here. Into the deal, any subsegments or areas where you're consciously pulling back from and
saying, hey we're going to avoid this landmine, just not looking to grow this business? And any areas where you
might see some opportunities? Thanks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Yeah. David, really, I don't think there's any difference in philosophy of IBTX and SouthState. You know, I think
we are wanting to manage our total CRE ratio well below the 300% and see that decline overtime. You were all
cautious naturally on office, cautious on assisted living. IBTX has got a really good solid retail, granular retail CRE
book and we're pretty bullish on that. So, I don't -- I don't anticipate a change in their lending practices or our
lending practices, but I do anticipate with the way we're going to accrete capital that our CRE concentration ratio
will drift down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. Appreciate it. But a housekeeping item. I know, obviously the profitability was great in 2025 with the
merger. How should we think about a go-forward tax rate once the merger is complete? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
You know, not -- I'm not forecasting a big change from where we are today, Dave. I'll probably have some more
refined estimates as we move closer to closing and maybe better update you guys in the next couple of quarters.
But this -- at this standpoint, I don't have anything, any major changes to project.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. Appreciate the color.

William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
If there are no further questions, I'm going to add and make one clarifying comment on the non-interest expenses.
I've seen some of you in your notes have noted the cost of the cyber event, which we have in the non-recurring
line item. In that year, based on about $8 million, about half of that in the first quarter and half in the second
quarter, we have coverage for the cyber event. We have not yet filed the insurance claim.
We have a retention amount and then there's some amounts related to some employee payments that would tend
to be covered by policy that'll be borne by us. Those two combined total about $2 million. So I know some of you
are adding -- adding it back as an operating expense in some of your models, but I wanted just to make that point.
We have yet to file that claim and would expect to be reimbursed for all but about $2 million of the cost of that
event. So, just FYI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Okay. So, yeah, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. John
Corbett for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
All right. Thank you, guys, for joining us this morning. We know you've got a lot of calls to jump on. So, if we can
provide any other clarity for you, don't hesitate to give us a ring. And I hope you have a great day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference. Thank you for joining. You may now
disconnect.
