Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. During the third quarter,
we continued to have success executing on our growth strategies across each of our businesses. In our wealth
management business, we've driven strong growth across each of our regions and our global family offices
business. We continue to see improved levels of engagement and new business activities with both existing and
new clients. During the quarter, we've also invested and strengthened our depth of expertise. There's no question
that labor markets are tight and competition for talent is fierce. But even amidst this environment, we are very
pleased with the additions to our team across the country.
Within asset management, we continue to see momentum in our quant active FlexShares, ETF and ESG
strategies. We launched six new climate-themed ETFs which incorporate our new ESG Vector Score. Two of the
launched funds were in Europe, marking our second launch of FlexShares offerings in Europe. We've also

continued to have growth in our liquidity products, and our money funds surpassed $300 billion in assets under
management during the quarter for the first time.
Additionally, our asset management business was recognized by InvestmentNews as a 2021 Excellence in
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award winner for the third consecutive year. Our asset servicing business
continues to see growth that is well diversified across regions, products and client segments. We remain focused
on driving profitable growth while investing and expanding our asset servicing solutions.
The current environment has continued to pressure margins earned by investment managers. And as they rethink
their operating models and whether to move to outsource solutions, our whole office approach has put us in a
position to help them achieve their goals. We're also positioned well to benefit from the trends of asset owners
managing more assets in-house, as the flexibility of our model and ability to combine capabilities for these clients
has been an area of strength.
Our growth strategies within each of our businesses resulted in 11% year-over-year growth This has resulted in
11% year-over-year growth for our trust fees and 10% growth in our revenue. Our expenses also increase year-
over-year albeit at a lower rate as we continue to invest in technology and our staff including higher levels of
compensation as we build a diverse, engaged workforce with skills for the future. Taken together, this resulted in
both positive fee operating leverage as well as positive total operating leverage.
To close, I also want to express my sincere and immense appreciation for our employees around the world whose
commitment, expertise and professionalism in serving our clients, communities and one another continues to be
truly extraordinary.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter.

Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's dive
into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of
$395.7 million. Earnings per share were $1.80, and our return on average common equity was 13.7%, which
matches our performance from the prior two quarters.
You can see some historical market data on the bottom of page 2. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees
are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels, and both the S&P 500 and EAFE Local had favorable
sequential performance based on those calculations. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-
month LIBOR rates were modestly lower during the quarter.
Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 10%
and expenses increased 3%. Net income was up 34%. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 4% and
expenses were up 1% while net income was up 7%.
The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $13 million in reserves in the current quarter, compared to a
release of $27 million in the prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from
10.5% a year ago and consistent with the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration and assets
under custody were both up 21% compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis. Assets under
management were $1.5 trillion and are up 17% from a year ago and also flat on a sequential basis.

Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Trust, investment and other services
fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1.1 billion and were up 11% from last year, and
up 3% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $66 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year, and
down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes while the sequential decline was
due to lower volumes and lower volatility.
The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $110 million in the quarter, up 21% from one year ago,
and up 11%, sequentially. Within this, securities commissions and trading income was up 40% from the prior
year, and up 10% sequentially. Higher levels of interest rate swap activity benefited both the year-over-year and
sequential results while higher core brokerage revenue also benefited the performance versus last year.
Other operating income totaled $62 million and was up 17% from one year ago, and up 15% sequentially. The
increase compared to a year ago was driven by distributions from certain investments in community development
projects, as well as higher banking and credit-related fees, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income. The
sequential increase was primarily driven by lower expenses related to Visa swap agreements and the higher
income from investments in community development projects. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more
detail later, was $357 million and was up 6% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our corporate and institutional
services business, fees totaled $630 million and were up 8% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Custody and
fund administration fees are $460 million and up 17% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-
year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Unfavorable currency
translation and lower transaction volumes also impacted the sequential comparison.
Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $14.8 trillion at quarter-end, up 21% year-over-
year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new
business. The sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets, offset by unfavorable
currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $114 million were down 17% year-over-year and up
13% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher money market fund fee waivers, partially
offset by favorable markets and new business.
The sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled
$49.9 million in the third quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, but up compared to $0.9 million in
the prior year. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.2 trillion, up 17% year-over-year and down 1%
sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets and client flows. The sequential
decline was driven by modest unfavorable impacts from markets and currency, partially offset by positive net
flows. Securities lending fees were $20 million, up 2% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Average collateral
levels were up 22% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.
Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $481 million and
were up 15% compared to the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in wealth management
totaled $26.7 million in the current quarter compared to $29.2 million in the prior quarter and $4.4 million in the
prior year.
Across the regions and Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and new
business, partially offset by higher fee waivers. For the sequential performance, the growth within the regions was
mainly due to favorable markets as well as slightly lower fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, the sequential
growth was primarily due to new business, favorable markets and lower fee waivers.

Assets under management for wealth management clients were $373 billion at quarter-end, up 17% year-over-
year and essentially flat on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and
client flows, while the sequential performance primarily reflected client flows, mainly offset by unfavorable
markets.
Moving to page 6, net interest income was $357 million in the quarter and was up 6% from the prior year. Earning
assets averaged $144 billion in the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $130 billion and
were up 15% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $38 billion and were up 16% compared to the
prior year.
The net interest margin was 0.98% in the quarter and was down 5 basis points from a year ago. The net interest
margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of balance sheet
volume and mix. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 4%. Average earning assets and
average deposits increased 1% on a sequential basis, while average loan balances were up 6%. The net interest
margin increased 1 basis point sequentially, primarily due to changes in balance sheet volume and mix.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and were 3% higher than the prior year and up
1% from the prior quarter. This quarter's results included a $6.9 million pension settlement charge within the
employee benefits expense category, while the prior quarter included a pension charge of $17.6 million. Also,
recall that last year's results included a $43.4 million charge relating to account servicing activities. Excluding
these items, expenses were up 7% versus the prior year and up 2% sequentially.
Compensation expense totaled $496 million and was up 7% compared to the prior year and was up 2%
sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher cash-based incentive accruals as well as
higher salaries. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher cash-based incentive accruals. Excluding the
previously mentioned pension settlement charges, employee benefits expense was down 3% from a year ago and
down 6% sequentially.
Outside services expense was $211 million and was up 13% from a year ago and down 3% from the prior quarter.
Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for approximately three-quarters of the year-over-year
growth. The remaining year-over-year growth within the category included higher technical services, consulting
and data processing related costs, reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements.
The sequential decline was driven by lower technical services, legal services and third-party advisor fees, partially
offset by higher sub-custody related costs.
Equipment and software expense of $185 million was up 8% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially. Both the
year-over-year and sequential increases reflected higher software support and amortization costs.
Occupancy expense of $54 million was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. Higher real estate taxes
and building operation costs were the primary drivers of both increases. Excluding the prior year's charge, other
operating expense of $81 million was down 3% from one year ago and up 20% sequentially. The year-over-year
decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses and staff related costs, partially offset by higher business
promotion spend. The sequential increase was impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust-
sponsored PGA golf tournament, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses within the category.
Turning to page 8, our capital ratios remained strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9% under the
standardized approach, down slightly from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, in line with the
6

prior quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 860,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $100 million. We
also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders.
The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance
sheet profile to support our clients' needs, and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and
solution expertise they've come to expect. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, wealth
management, asset management and asset servicing, continues to resonate well in the marketplace and is
generating organic growth across each business.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's third quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark and
I'd be happy to answer your questions. Allen, will you please open the line?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with
Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks very much. The first one is question on custody and fund administration fees.
Usually, we're beating you up in saying, why didn't they grow as much as assets. But this time, you have 17%
growth, almost kept pace with the 21% growth in assets. So, I guess, the underlying question is what's the nature
of the new business that you're adding on? How's that average fee compared to the overall average? And if
there's anything else you could add on in there, that'd be great because it's interesting. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, I'll start and if Mike wants to jump in. In looking at what's been added on, what was interesting to me is
that it's a really good blend across geographies and across client channels. And so, there's been good business
that's been onboarded in EMEA, APAC but also in North America. And then, you look at the client channels,
whether it's our traditional institutional investor group, IIG, or our fund services group, there's been business that's
been onboarded across the board.
Interestingly, we don't look that much at kind of the average fee per the assets coming onboard. We look much
more at what are we doing for those clients. And so, I think what jumps more to me is how we've been able to
continue to build in some of the other ancillary services that we're doing for clients, things overall like core
brokerage. And you see FX down mostly because of the summer dynamic, but it's up nicely over a year-over-
year. Mike, anything to add?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
I would just add, Glenn, two points. One is that with some of the new business that came online during the
quarter, it was – as Jason mentioned, in North America, it was in fund services and specifically fund
administration plus other services related to that. So, think about those as kind of full-service clients to your point
where per dollar of assets is going to be higher. So, good client wins on that front.
And then, the second thing is that we also get growth through the, I'll say, success and growth of our clients. And
we've seen that particularly in the alternative assets area where they've had good flows and good appreciation.
And that has flowed through to some of the increase in fees that you've seen for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That makes a lot of sense. Maybe just a quick follow-up now that you mentioned the alternative world. Obviously,
there's a big push and ongoing momentum in the high-net-worth individuals increasing their allocations to alts.
We've seen that in a bunch of the big broker dealers. We've seen the alts getting success in distributing their
product. You had a big wealth management platform. Can you just talk to us about where you're at in terms of that
evolution? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Strategically, we see that as – it's been successful, to your point, Glenn, but still is a big opportunity for us across
the company, so meaning, each of our businesses. And with each of those, I would say we are trying to provide
more in the way of services or around that. So, within asset management, our 50 South business is completely
focused on providing alternative solutions for our both wealth management clients, but also institutional clients.
Certainly, within asset servicing, I mentioned there a little bit alternative asset managers. As you know, we have a
relatively meaningful business in hedge funds. With hedge funds, we're looking to expand that more to private
capital where, again, we have a strong client base, but looking to grow that faster.
And then, also with wealth management, if you just look at the asset allocation of our wealth management clients,
at this point, it would indicated that overall their allocation to alternatives should be higher over time. And so, how
can we provide that? We have some solutions on our platform, in addition to 50 South, where they can invest
directly in alternative funds. But we believe that there's more we can do across the spectrum of clients that we
have.

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning. So, I just want to start off with a question on organic growth and maybe specific to the wealth
management segment, some of your peers have been citing that flow rates have been running hot, expecting
some moderation or normalization in the coming quarters. I was hoping you could speak to where organic growth
within the wealth segment is running today and what do you believe is a sustainable flow rate for that business
longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, the – I'd head start with separating the regions from GFO. And in general, over the last several years, the
GFO business, which obviously it's – people that are less familiar than you are, Steve, that serves the very upper
end of our market, clients with dedicated family offices. And we think that that matches our brand particularly well.
Then, we've seen strong growth there on a consistent basis. And so, within the wealth segment, that's where
we've seen higher levels.
And then I think progressively that in general, the higher the client base in terms of assets, that's where we've
done well. And so, that's been a continued theme for us. And as we look year-over-year, there's – we've always
talked about the fact that wealth will be lower organic growth relative to C&IS through a cycle but still positive. And
that's what we've seen even if we look year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I would just add, there's also a tremendous amount of activity right now, which – difficult to predict how that will
continue. But when you think about family-owned businesses and other liquidity events for business owners, that
wealth creation where it goes from a business to being liquid wealth creates the opportunity for us to work with
those clients in a different way. And so, there have been a high level of activity on that front. And we'll see what
happens through the end of the year here, potential tax changes, things like that that generally creates
opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
It's great. And just for my follow-up on the NII outlook. Certainly, encouraging to see the uptick in securities yields
in the quarter. And just curious if the forward curve holds, have we reached a point where we've lapped
reinvestment headwinds? And just bigger picture in terms of the NII outlook more broadly, given strong loan
growth and improving rate backdrop, should we expect to now grow off the current NII base level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, we're still – we're not fully all the way through from an NII perspective. The whole balance sheet is, call it,
85% to 90% through. But obviously, we're not quite all the way there yet from a securities perspective. We're
getting close. We're still losing, I'd call it, based on the reinvestment rates right now, about $1 million a quarter in
9


Northern Trust Corp.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
reinvestment, but that's going to eventually taper off. And it's not as big of an impact as it was a year ago,
obviously, just having $1 million quarter drag. And so, you're right in that from here, mostly the drivers are going to
be based on what's happening in the business. And so, you saw a strong loan growth and other factors of where
we're investing, be the key drivers of the movement in NII, and the drag from reinvestment is definitely much,
much lower than what it was before.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Brennan. If you're talking, you're on mute, Brennan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Man, it's happened to me again. Sorry about that. I like to follow up on Steven's question and his point I think is
really fair. We've seen a pretty significant acceleration from a lot of the wealth management firms and it's
happening broadly. It's happening in the mass affluent space. It's happening in the high-net-worth space.
It doesn't seem like you guys have seen a similar magnitude of acceleration, but we're not sure because we don't
get the granular disclosure. So, number one, could you maybe juxtapose – do you juxtapose your growth versus
some of those peers? And then, maybe if the growth hasn't accelerated the way we've seen at some of the
others, why do you think that is? Do you think it's because you are focused on ultra-high net worth? Do you think
it's – has something to do with your approach in how you market to clients where face-to-face meetings are a lot
more important? What do you think might be going on there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Start, Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, I'll start. And I think to your point, our business is different than what I would call the broad market for wealth
managers. And as we've talked about many times, we're a more focused upmarket where some of that activity
can be lumpier, if you will, where there are large transactions that either our clients are a part of or large wins
where we're bringing on new clients with very meaningful wealth.
And so, I think in that sense, you are going to have different dynamics that happen there. Now, we do internally
track closely the flows and the revenues that are coming in from the different types of clients. And as much as
10


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
there's been some variability in the proportion that's coming from the ultra-high net worth versus the high net
worth, it's still relatively steady.
So, I would say to your point, we are participating in this very kind of broad base whether we're participating as
much as any one of the other particular competitors I can't speak to. But on the higher end, it has its own set of
dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And Jason, you've recently flagged some upward expense pressure at an industry
conference, which has been a big focus for investors. So, I understand that it's probably too early to get much of a
sense for magnitude on that front, but if it is possible to try to frame the magnitude, that'd be helpful, number one.
And number two, even with that upward pressure, is the commitment and the focus still on generating fee
revenue, operating leverage, or organic operating leverage ex the fee waivers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thanks. I don't want to ramble. Would it be helpful for me to just give a little bit of an overview expenses in
general or do you want me to just stay specifically on the – on kind of what happen with technology, equipment
and services, outside services?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, it's much more about the outlook and thinking about next year versus what's happened here recently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, sounds good. So, we mentioned historically that we think about expenses in four categories. There's inflation,
efficiencies, investments and growth. So, just keep that framework in mind, and I'll give some of the key themes
that we're thinking about as we're thinking about 2022 expenses. So, first, inflation is going to hit in a couple of
areas. Mike talked earlier about the pressures we're feeling there. In comp, we're going to see higher growth
levels. Every firm is talking about the challenges of retaining and attracting top talent. We're no different. So, this
will hit. It's affecting the salary base now, but it's going to continue to embed over time. And we'll see a larger than
historical adjustment in second quarter when our normal base pay adjustments actually hit. It also though – it
affects incentives, and that's already hitting the income statement. We've got a – there's a higher incentive accrual
in third quarter of 2021 as we're addressing these issues.
And then, secondly, as you talked – you highlighted kind of the equipment, software, and outside services lines,
which I think are – we should really talk about those in concert with one another because there's some movement
between those lines and we want to – we're going to continue investing and strengthening the technology
foundation, given that we've got the digital transformation that's happening in wealth management and everything
we want to do to maximize defenses against cyber threats. That means equipment, software, and outside
services are going to still continue to be on a higher growth rate relative to the other expense categories.
Now, just remember, about half of those lines are tied to business growth, but we're going to see the foundational
element of those continue to be invested in. The third theme I'd call out is call it a return to normal. And that's
going to touch on occupancy and then travel which hits in other operating expenses. We're going to be on the
11


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
road more often, and that'll hit those – that line item. And we're not going to – likely get to pre-COVID levels, but
by the end of next year, that'll be significantly higher.
And then, the last theme is on efficiency actions. And we embedded efficiency and productivity targets into our
plan every year. We made a big push on efficiency this year with the staff actions. We took out 400 roles, mostly
in North America, and that drove the savings we talked about of about $50 million. We're going to continue to
push for opportunities across all the expense categories to find efficiencies, but those are the big four themes that
have been on my mind is – in our minds, not mine, all of our minds, as we talk – as we start to talk about 2022.
So, hopefully, hopefully that's helpful and giving you a little bit of an outlook of how we're thinking about expenses.

Jason J. Tyler A

Thank you so much for reminding me of that, because that – it's – that is – it's super important. And I think a lot of
people try and think about are Northern's expenses going to be flat, up? It depends. We consider ourselves still a
growth company. We want to drive revenue growth. And so, that fourth element of the framework I gave in the
beginning of those comments around growth, if we're growing expenses because of that, because we've got good
revenue growth, that's fine. That's good. And so, the key thing we look at when we put all that together, what does
the operating leverage look like for the company?

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. This follows from the last question. I'm not sure you answered that last question. Maybe that
was intentional because you're going to wait. So, do you think you'll have the operating leverage based on fees
relative to expenses even with the higher comp, T&E and cyber? But the general question is, where are you on
the broader investing curve? I mean, head count this year should probably grow only by about 1%; and for the
prior five years, it grew by about 5%. That's a dramatic reduction in the number of people that you're adding, so it
looks like a lot more productivity.
So, the question is how much is that driven from technology and is sustainable and it should help drive positive
operating leverage in the future? And how much is simply more productive employees who might cost more in the
future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Mike, I'm going to start with that because you've highlighted, I think, a really important dynamic, which is we
have seen this meaningful increase in productivity. That said, looking at the drivers of that, yes, some of it is from
technology that has enabled us to automate activities and other initiatives that we've been executing on for some
time period.
That said, another driver is the tight market for talent and just the remote working environment. It's changed the
operating environment. And to your point or question on sustainability, my judgment would be that it's a little tight.
It's too tight at this point. So, we've continued to grow, as Jason's highlighted. Some of that growth, yes, comes
through the markets, but we've also added new clients, net new business for us. We've added people as a part of
that. We've tried to do it very efficiently. But also, it's been a heavy burden, I would just say, on the employees to
be able to deliver that in a remote working environment.
And so, back to this broader question on what we're driving towards, it's profitable growth which does mean
growing fees, growing revenue faster than we're growing our expense base with that. Now, at any quarter, at any
year, it can ebb and flow a little bit, but that's the objective over time. And when we look at the profitability in this
quarter, whether you want to look at the ROE, the pre-tax margin or the fees to expenses, they're all at pretty
attractive levels. Could they be better, particularly on the pre-tax margin, if the rate environment changes?
Absolutely, and we'd like to see that. But we think we're operating pretty efficiently today. Certainly look to do
more, but we're in an unusual operating environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, one related question. As far as the investments in your back office, which you've retooled, as it relates
to the cloud, I think you are more conservative with your plans to move more workloads to the public cloud. And
I'm just curious as to why the more conservatism on your part versus some other financial firms.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, I would say, our cloud strategy is absolutely focused and tailored to our business, our client base. And so, the
pace or how it'd be characterized, Mike, relative to somebody else could be viewed differently. I don't have a
problem with that. We're looking at how does it fit with what we're doing. Given the nature of our client base and
what we do for them, yes, we are highly sensitized to all the potential impacts and risks of a transition like that.

Now, with that said, we have been very focused, first, on the private cloud. And beyond the fact that that's been a
strategy that we've been executing on for years, in this past year, we completely upgraded the capabilities of the
private cloud for us and have many, many of our applications and activities in the private cloud.
As far as public cloud, we're taking a hybrid cloud approach to that. To your point, I would say being thoughtful
about how we do it. And we are still in the earlier stages of the actual transition of applications and activities into
the public cloud. The strategy is there to continue to do that, but in a thoughtful, secure, stable way for our
business and for our clients.

Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Jason. Hi. Jason, can you give us some color on – you had real good loan
growth this quarter sequentially, just what was driving the loan growth? And then, also with the balance sheet,
your average deposits, you pointed out, grew sequentially, but the period-end numbers fell. So, maybe if you
could give us some color on that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, let me start with loan growth. Two buckets. One is in the personnel side. And again, in that bucket,
those can be extremely high net worth clients that want to use our balance sheet to sell for liquidity needs. And
the reason I highlight that is because it can be very volatile and unpredictable. But roughly half of the sequential
increase came from that general bucket.
The second bucket is commercial which was about the other half. And that's more stable and that's been in
various areas. But we've talked about going to our existing clients and doing more of the existing loan types with
them, but explaining to them that we've got appetite to do more with them. And part of our business model, not
just financial model, is to grow with our clients. And I think that's one of the things that's driven our loan growth, is
our clients have been – they've been active. And we've told them we're happy to participate with them more in
those ways. And so, that's hit on the commercial line. And so, again, I think part of it is the base there has
definitely risen. But part of it is some components that might be more volatile over time.
14

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
And then, on deposit volumes, and as you know well because I know you follow this closely, that can also just be
volatile. And we've got our clients who will – they'll call us and ask to put not millions, but sometimes hundreds of
millions or billions of dollars on the balance sheet. And so, we tend not to look at the deposit at the quarter-end
balances. I do look, coming into the quarter and after the quarter, how they trend. And this quarter didn't look very
different in terms of how balance has trended coming in or out. So, I didn't overread the dynamic that you
mentioned of the average versus quarter-end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. And then, you and your peers have had a strong year-over-year growth in your fee
revenues. You've talked about it already on this call. Can you pull out for us what percentage would you attribute
the growth in the custody fees in the wealth management fees that is? From market appreciation versus new
business or additional flows from clients, can you parse through that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, I can split it. Let's just start – we'll give year-over-year and if we think about the C&IS business, there's –
let's say, a good chunk has come from markets, call it high – mid to high-single digit. And then, there's also the
organic or net new business and other dynamics would represent the rest. And that adds up overall to kind of,
again, mid to high-single digits but a little bit less, call it 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And that's on total C&IS trust fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And then on wealth, I can do the same type of split for you and a little bit more weighted toward market
there, which is that's had an impact that's stronger if we look year-over-year, more like 15%, 20% type. And the
organic piece, if I add it up, also strong but more in the low-single digit range on a percentage basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And the waivers are certainly in that mix too.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Hi. Good morning. I had a question just a bit more strategic to kick off on how you're thinking about the returns
that you're going to be generating from the investments you're making today in the various sleeves and across the
globe. I'm just wondering if we think about where we are today versus pre-COVID, has the return profile changed
much for your incremental investment spend? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, Betsy, I wouldn't necessarily say that the return profile has changed. In many respects, what I think has
been interesting through the crisis here is that although there was a pause in some of the execution of projects
and programs around investments in the initial stages of the pandemic, it picked up pretty quickly thereafter. And
instead of groups all being in one room working together on a digital project, they figured out how to do it by
WebEx, Zoom, or Teams.
So, in that sense, we've continued to make really good progress on investments such as – just to give you an
example, the digitalization of our wealth management business where there's a number of components to that
journey as we call it. And so, that progress has been very good. And I'd say in general to your point on the timing
or the profile for the returns on that should be similar to what we would have expected when we started it.
The one thing I would say is just the characterization or the character, if you will, of investments in the different
businesses, I talked earlier in the call about launching new funds in asset management, for example. So, there's
meaningful investment that goes into product development. And again, throughout the last couple years here,
they've continued to put out new products and then it takes some time period for those to obviously build AUM,
but then are very profitable over time. That profile is very different than asset servicing where a lot of the
investment – the return you're going to get is near term in the sense of bringing on a large client. There's some
integration, transition costs with that. But then, once that's up and running, essentially you're getting the return for
that investment.

And then, finally, just wealth management, I talked about some additions that we've made, not just in the last
quarter, but could go back. And there, you're hiring people and teams that are in different parts of the country.
Again, it takes a little bit of the time for them to get on and get acclimated, but they're productive relatively quickly
as well. So, we look at all of those when we put together both our longer-term strategic planning, but also the
annual plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, just a little more nitty-gritty. I'm wondering if there's any update on how you're thinking about the
– reinvesting the expenses that have been associated with the golf tournament. Is that going to flow through in
other types of marketing or is that really get thrown into the bigger bucket of opportunity set and we could see that
migrate into other areas of investment, not specifically around that sleeve of client that you've been investing in
with the golf tournament. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. The way I would characterize it, Betsy, is – the golf tournament was a great opportunity for us to build our
brand and particularly focused on a certain target market. And that was highly successful. Going forward, we'll
continue to invest in the brand. So, yes, some of that investment will go into brand building and marketing.
However, there are also a portion of that, to your point, will be considered more broadly in the investments we're
making, whether that's in people or technology or other areas to continue to grow that company.

Hi, Ken. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Just, Jason, wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts around
fee waivers from here, they look – came down a little bit. Obviously, rates moved to touch, but not that much. Just
any updated thoughts on where you expect those to sit and vis-à-vis waiting for bigger movements in rates going
forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. A couple thoughts. One, even though we saw a little creep this quarter, fairly larger than what we thought, it
was actually – if you think about it, it was driven more by volume. And we – and Mike talked in his opening
comments about the fact that money market mutual funds are over $300 billion. That's a record for us. And so –
17


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
and I think people sometimes forget that we're participating in the growth, but it also causes higher waivers. And
so – but what's more important is that the overall base of business that we have there is good.
And so, if you add the – if you add up the waivers plus what we're earning, and so you think about the overall
capacity that we have at the current volume level, it's somewhat $475 million to $500 million. And that's a strong
capacity that we have there. Now, will volumes stay in as rates go up, probably – maybe not, but it's nice that
we've had good volume growth there.
And the other thing to remember is it doesn't take a big lift in rates for the sort of waivers to come down. And a lot
of our AUM there is more institutional pricing. Even our – even on the wealth side, even the waivers that are
associated on the wealth management side are – the nature of our client base means they price themselves more
like institutions. They have to got the purchasing power to have more of an institutional approach. And so, the
fees aren't that high, and it doesn't take that much more yield to clear those hurdles and start to get back to that
capacity level.
And then, if you – the other dynamic is that run rate wise we're still – as we sit today, we're still a little over $300
billion that held in over the quarter-end and the run rate on waivers is right at $75 million a quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Okay. Great. And then, second question, just coming back to the operating leverage points. This year, a bit
of like easy comp for market levels, right, driving, the huge trust fee growth and then kind of a harder comp for
costs off of last year's really low base. So, this year you've got this really wide gap, but in absolute revenue, and
in an absolute cost growth rate that are both above trend, so to speak. And so, I think the reason why the
questions come – keep coming up about cost growth is next year when presumably we don't get as much of that
back-end lift from markets alone, what happens with the absolute growth of expenses relative to what might be a
slower, and naturally, a slower overall revenue growth rate. So, how much of this year's 5%, 6% growth rate was
also influenced by just the kind of easy comps from last year, so to speak, as it helps to think us about like
absolute levels of expense growth next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Just a perspective on that for you, Ken, is I think you're right. I mean, we did get a meaningful benefit from
the market, in the fee growth. And that helps that positive operating fee leverage, fee operating leverage. And the
other way that I think about it is what is the absolute level of the expenses to fees. And so, now for this quarter,
we're at about 102%. And that is a much lower level than we have been, and that's evidence of this positive fee
operating leverage over time.
And so, at that tight level, to your point, to then say in the next year, can you continue to drive that down at that
same rate? That's why I say it kind of ebbs and flows, right? But we want to be in that range around that 100%,
105%, somewhere in there, to make sure that we are appropriately investing in the business, etcetera, but also
growing. We don't want to squeeze that so much that it impinges on our ability to serve our clients and to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Good perspective on reminding about that expense to trust fees. Thanks.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Just maybe on the balance sheet, if I look over the last two quarters, securities – average security levels
have been declining while cash levels have been growing. Is this you positioning for higher rates or is this –
there's something else driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Something else driving that. And it's – there's a hard line that people see externally between the – between cash
and securities. But there's so many different security types that are actually within the cash and within the
securities. And on the cost of cash and securities, there are some areas where we've strategically gone back and
forth into and out of. And that's frankly where the change in classification that you see has been driven.
And so, there could be securities that are – that have a risk-return profile that are very similar to one another, one
of which should be classified as cash and one would be classified as securities. And that's strategically where
we'll make some of the kind of portfolio decisions of where we want to be playing based on what we're seeing in
the marketplace and how we think about the risk-return characteristics. And just in a sentence, that's what's been
driving that – the distinction that you see based on the external reporting classification.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. But can you maybe speak to whether you, A, believe asset sensitivity increased quarter-over-quarter? And
how much of that central bank cash you think is available to invest when you feel the time is right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, plenty of availability from a non-HQLA perspective. And we – from our perspective, we're not constrained by
that. We feel – we've got plenty of liquidity, plenty of buffers to be able to react if we see more opportunities in the
marketplace. And we've just – we've been running the portfolio based on consistent risk-return characteristics and
where we want to be from a liquidity perspective, but certainly no constraints. And plenty of dry powder whether
19

it's from a regulatory perspective or even our own view of what we want to do for more of an economic liquidity
perspective for us to be able to put more to work if we see the opportunity to do so.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

done much strategically there to change asset sensitivity.

Thanks. Good morning, folks. Hey. Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I do
have two more. One, sorry, if I missed this, but the growth in CI&S (sic) [C&IS] investment management linked-
quarter up 13% with money market waivers being flat, what was the main driver of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Brian, it's Mark. So, you're looking at the sequential growth in C&IS investment management fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Just to make sure – yes. So, yeah, it was a combination of both markets and organic growth. And to Jason's
point, we did have – with the higher money fund level, even though waivers go up, that does come with fees –
with net new fees. And that would have been partly behind that. But if you were going to break it down, I'd say that
the new business or organic growth, I would say, drove a little bit more than the market growth did on that
sequential growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Perfect. And that actually is a good dovetail into my second question. A little bit broader, but ESG
asset management, I think, last time I saw it, I think you guys were $155 billion, correct me if I'm wrong on that, on
Northern Trust ESG AUM. Maybe just – the question, I guess, would be from the organic growth side of your
investment management business. And as you think of that coming both from the institutional side and then
especially on the wealth management side, how are you viewing that? First of all, is it important to your wealth
management clients to have this capability – investment management capabilities? And I think, Mike, you
mentioned the launch of six new products in the quarter, but then also the organic growth potential for Northern
Trust investment management from developing those ESG capabilities, is that going to be a major driver going
forward?

Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Brian, I would say that that is another major trend, obviously, that's in the marketplace, but also big driver for
our strategy going forward, yes, across the company, but as you've highlighted, particularly within asset
management. And at that $155 billion in AUM now, the growth rate over the last five years there has been about
double of what the market growth rate has been for ESG, best we can measure it there.
And to your point, this hits across our client spectrum. So, a lot of that, it started more outside the US, in EMEA
where we initially saw that the greatest growth with institutional clients. But now, we're seeing it more through
funds in the US and with both institutional clients, but also with our wealth clients. And we think we're still in the
early days. We think that that ESG or sustainability investing will be at a higher growth rate than the rest of the
market overall.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys. A question on capital allocation, you've been very transparent on the components of your
overall capital allocation strategy ratio relative to peers, paying dividends, supporting growth, et cetera. Any
change in your outlook on any of those components that could impact the capital return trajectory going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thanks for reminding the framework for everyone, but the key element there that has been a driver has been
we've been able to see the RWA growth because we've seen loan growth coming. And it's a big factor in how
things get driven. And there are other things too we could see from securities lending and other components of
RWA. And at this point, we don't see the same type of RWA lift.

Now, it's not to say that it can't happen. And if it does happen and if we see it, then we'll then look at the other
factors and determine where we want to be from a CET1 perspective in other areas. But as we sit today, we don't
see the type of organic growth coming in RWA. That's the one component of that overall mosaic I would highlight.

Operator: All right. Next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, I had a question around the money
market fund business. You've had quite a lot of success growing that business in AUM and really gaining share
against a large sort of book of inflows that the whole industry has seen. How sticky do you think those assets are
going to be in light of tapering, hopefully, near term, but also sort of longer term as we start to contemplate
interest rate increases? I think we've all sort of gotten accustomed to thinking about, all right, deposits will
probably start to leave the industry. But how intertwined do you think the money market fund business is with that
as we sort of contemplate how much of fee waivers could ultimately come back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll start, Alex, and then, Jason, who knows that business well, can give his perspective. But I think what's
interesting is coming into the pandemic a couple of years ago, you had a combination of two things. One is the
obvious, which you're pointing out, which is just significant easing on the part of the central banks, increased
liquidity and that absolutely drove the flows into the money market funds is one place.
But the other dynamic is that was also at a point in time where strategically NTAM was expanding its distribution
for money funds. And so, not only having a portal, but being on other portals. And so, it was an intentional
strategy that hit at the right time to essentially capture more a greater share of the increased flows coming from
the additional liquidity in the marketplace. So then, if you take that and then try to answer your question of what
happens to the extent that you have tapering and some contraction there, I think, yes, of course, you're going to
see it go down. But I think it's going to be stickier than you might think in the sense of it wasn't just the one factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah. That's helpful because the share gain dynamic definitely helped there. My follow-up is sort of related
to that. Sorry to go back to the operating leverage dynamic again. But Mike, I appreciate you framing it the way

you did, is like, look, we're doing 100% to 105% expenses to total fees, that's kind of where we hope to be. As we
contemplate fee waivers coming back, should I think of the expenses to fees going below 100%, which I guess
would imply almost all the fee waiver benefit will come through the bottom line at 100% margin? Or 100% to
105% is kind of where you see yourself living even with a normalization in sort of interest rates? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, kiddingly, if you could also tell me what equity market levels are going to be at that point in time, that
would help as well because – but you're highlighting the right thing, Alex, that we're benefiting now from strong
markets with regard to that ratio. And we're being penalized, if you will, by this – the money market fund fee
waivers. And so, that's playing out in there.
But I would say, more importantly, to your question is, yes, that's going to ebb and flow. But I don't believe that
that is a ratio that just continues to grind down below zero and well below zero, etcetera, because I think that that
would actually – again, that would impact our ability to have the right talent, make sure that they're compensated
appropriately and fairly for all the value that they're delivering, to invest in the technology, to take care of our
clients, but also to grow the business.
So, simplistically, it would be a draw on the business if you tried to squeeze it too tight, so to speak. So, that's why
my own view is that that range is more importantly – more important.
Now, that said, I – that is not the only ratio that drives overall profitability and returns, as you know. And right now,
with rates where they are and net interest margin where it is, the other revenues, so to speak, which are a bigger
driver in driving the pre-tax margin are at a lower level than they have been. And so, point being, you can be in
that range and yet have the other revenues growing in such a way that your profitability is going up and your
returns are going up.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of them. Firstly, balance sheet. Given the plans for tapering – your
average deposits have been gradually going up. What do you see as the outlook for that, given the tapering thing
that I just mentioned? Do you see yourself being able to continue to grow that?

Well, I think it's hard to tell. I think our clients right now see the flat yield curve. And I've been saying, it's – I think
it's less about the very short end of the curve. And in some ways, that has more to do with the shape of the curve.
And if there's some lift in the medium, then I think that's – more than anything else, would – what might cause
clients to move off of the overnight effectively to try and get some yield. Right now, with rates flat so far out,
there's just no enticement to do anything else.
Another dynamic is that some clients think about cash as an asset allocation, and equity – we were just talking
about that, the equity markets have done well. And so, with markets now where they are and everyone seeing
their overall portfolio so much stronger, we should also assume clients are going to want to have more allocation
to cash. And so, I think both of those dynamics need to be played through as we think through. But we certainly
think that the things Mike talked about with the money market mutual funds and the strength of our balance sheet
are things that do attract clients to think that it's a good place for us to be able to provide liquidity resource for
them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. A separate question for both of you. What are you seeing in the alts space in terms of pricing? There's
pricing compression overall that all of you talk about in the custody business, but specifically alts which has
always had a higher fee rate. Do you see that coming down more than the overall fee rate pricing? Do you see
more compression there, given that it's higher? Or any thoughts and color on that.

Thinking more from that perspective...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
...both hedge funds and the private side, especially with new players like you getting in, as you mentioned, trying
to grow that more. What – how do you see that dynamic playing out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, I would say that, particularly on the hedge fund administration side of it, some of that has already played
through in previous years. And so, like – it would be similar then to other asset classes. On the private capital
side, so PE and infrastructure and real estate and things like that, to your point, it's earlier in the development of
that market. More of it, I think, will be outsourced over time. And the size of the funds, obviously, are increasing.
And so, just from a pure rate perspective, yes, I do think that that will play out in more compression on that, if you
will, than in some of the other asset classes.
