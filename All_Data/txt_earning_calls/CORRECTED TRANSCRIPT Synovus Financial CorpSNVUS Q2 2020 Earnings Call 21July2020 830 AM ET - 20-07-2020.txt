Kessel D. Stelling
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. And good morning to everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Before I
move to the financials, I just wanted to share a few comments and reflections on our industry and our company.
The defining characteristic of our industry is changed, and I've certainly seen my share of change in my four-and-
a-half decades in this business including this unprecedented pandemic and period of social unrest. And although
pain is relentless, I've never been more convinced of the ability and responsibility of our industry to be a trusted
resource for our customers and for the communities we serve.
Synovus, in particular, is built for times like these, embedded in our markets, close to our customers, and able to
quickly assess and anticipate needs. And that continues to ring true as challenges linger even as we see
glimpses of a slow and steady recovery. The story we'll tell today is largely shaped by our model that has allowed
us to respond to, plan for, and do our best to control the things we can control.
So before I turn the call over to Jamie, I'll share highlights of the second quarter beginning on slide 3. Adjusted
diluted EPS was $0.23 compared to $0.21 last quarter and $1 a year ago. Loan balances increased $1.7 billion or
4.3% compared to the prior quarter. Growth in Paycheck Protection Program loans of $2.7 billion was offset by a
reduction in C&I line utilization of $775 million. In the consumer book, loans were down approximately $700

million, as reductions in lending partnership balances were partially offset by mortgage balance increases of $200
million.
Total deposits grew $4.4 billion or 11% from the prior quarter. Growth was largely split between DDA and interest-
bearing core deposits, which grew $2.9 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. We continued the strategy of allowing
higher-priced CDs to run off, which led to a decline of $655 million in time deposits.
Net interest income was up $3 million for the quarter. This included a full quarter of the 150 basis point reduction
in short-term rates from March, along with offsets including over $9 million in fee recognition associated with PPP
loans. The net interest margin declined 24 basis points to 3.13%.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $95 million was greater than expected, largely due to outperformance in
mortgage. Net mortgage revenue was $24 million, up $11 million from the prior quarter, led by secondary
mortgage production of $635 million, up $380 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted non-interest expense totaled
$276 million, up $5 million from the previous quarter. This included $7 million of COVID-related expenses and $7
million in fees associated with the implementation of certain Synovus Forward initiatives.
Commission expense was $7 million higher than the prior quarter, largely resulting from record mortgage
production. These increases were offset by reductions in other areas including seasonal employment fees and
travel. Provision for credit losses was $142 million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.74%
excluding the PPP balances. That's an increase of 35 basis points from the previous quarter and incorporates a
more stressed economic outlook. Credit quality metrics remain stable with the non-performing loan ratio and net
charge-off ratio of 37 basis points and 24 basis points, respectively.
Capital ratios improved based on strong operating performance and balance sheet optimization, which Jamie will
detail later in the presentation. Our CET1 ratio increased 20 basis points to 8.90% and our total risk-based capital
ratio increased 41 basis points to end at 12.70%, a two-year high.
The 90-day deferral program we outlined on the last call has done exactly what it was intended to do by providing
much needed support and assistance for our customers. While it's too early to know exactly how deferrals will
play out in the second half of 2020, with use of customer cash flows, client surveys and conversations and
interactions with customers to-date, lead us to believe that somewhere between 3% to 5% of total loans will have
a round two deferral granted for a 90-day deferment of principal and interest.
Jamie, will now share more detail about the quarter.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kessel. As Kessel noted, this is a very eventful quarter for our company with considerable progress
on a number of fronts despite headwinds. The resulting impact on our balance sheet has been significant.
Starting with loans on slide 4, as we shared in May, we funded $2.9 billion in PPP loans for approximately 19,000
customers, quite an undertaking, which required a coordinated effort across our bank. The average PPP loan was
approximately $150,000, and the customers that received those loans employ over 335,000 employees.
An offset to the C&I growth from PPP loans, which ended the quarter with the balance of $2.7 billion was a
decrease in loan balances from C&I line utilization. We ended the second quarter at a record low of 41% that

resulted in balance sheet declines of $775 million. We expect C&I line utilization to normalize in the mid to upper
40% range as the economy improves.
Highlights in the consumer portfolio include mortgage loan balance increases of over $200 million on a production
of our record $800 million. As was disclosed during the quarter, we restructured our GreenSky relationship in a
way that is mutually beneficial. Our total exposure limit remains $1 billion for the relationship, but you will see a
shift of loan balances from held-for-investment to held-for-sale.
In the second quarter, we moved $266 million in loans to held-for-sale under this new arrangement. Going
forward, you will see a shift in geography on the income statement from our GreenSky loans, as we realize more
non-interest revenue from transactions and servicing fees, as well as reduction in net interest income and non-
interest expense.
The other meaningful item to highlight within partnership lending is a disposition of approximately $535 million in
student loans. In June, we moved those loans to held-for-sale, which contributed to the decline in consumer
balances and resulted in an allowance release of approximately $12 million. We have closed that transaction
since quarter-end, realizing a modest gain, which will be recorded in the third quarter.
We believe that the strength of the market for these loans is a testament to the quality of these loan portfolios and
we remain committed to those relationships, while also acknowledging that our core customer base takes priority
as we focus on managing our balance sheet in these uncertain times. We continue to expect loans to be flat for
the remainder of the year excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness.
On slide 5, you can see that we had unprecedented growth in deposits with DDA balances up $2.9 billion and
total deposits up $4.4 billion in the second quarter. Much of this growth occurred in conjunction with our PPP
lending effort. However, we also saw broad-based growth across interest-bearing transaction balances with
money market and NOW up 11% quarter-over-quarter, while savings balances increased by 14% quarter-over-
quarter. While lower-cost transactional deposit growth has accelerated since late in the first quarter, we have
continued to experience strategic declines within our core time deposit portfolio.
As you are aware, much of these declines have been intentional over the last several quarters as we reduced
exposure to higher-cost CDs and public funds in certain markets. One of the benefits of having a sizable time
deposit portfolio is the ability to reprice as rates decline and that portfolio turns over. With our transactional
interest-bearing accounts approaching lowest rates experienced since the great financial crisis, we expect further
declines in rate paid on deposits to be led by strategic turnover within our core and broker time deposit portfolios.
As a simple means of comparison to the prior cycle, Synovus achieved its lowest deposit cost in the third quarter
of 2014. At that time, total interest-bearing deposit costs were roughly 35 basis points. While our deposit mix has
evolved from that time, we believe a return to comparable levels is achievable in the coming quarters with
continued pricing and balance sheet discipline. We expect deposits to decline in the second half of 2020 as
excess liquidity is deployed.
Slide 6 shows net interest income of $377 million, an increase of $3 million from the previous quarter. This
benefited from $9 million in fee accretion from our PPP loan portfolio. In the coming quarters, PPP forgiveness
may have a meaningful impact on our net interest income, as unearned fees associated with that program are
recognized in the interest income. PPP processing fees totaled $95 million.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
In terms of net interest margin, we ended the quarter at 3.13%, down 24 basis points from the first quarter.
Beyond the anticipated impact associated with the lower rate environment, the significant inflow of deposits
throughout the quarter resulted in an excess cash position, which while not impactful to net interest income,
diluted the margin by approximately 8 basis points as compared to the prior quarter.
Although we expect to maintain an elevated level of liquidity within the current economic environment, we also
anticipate some reversal in that elevated position in the second half of the year, which should support the margin.
Balance sheet management activities in the second quarter, including securities portfolio sales, the student loan
sale, and the GreenSky strategy change, will serve as a headwind to net interest income beginning in the third
quarter and will put some additional downward pressure on the margin. The impact of these recent transactions is
approximately 9 basis points to the margin. After adjusting for these impacts, and excluding the impact of PPP
loans, we expect the margin to remain relatively stable in the second half of 2020.
We were pleased with non-interest revenue of $173 million or $95 million adjusted shown on slide 7. Transaction
activities, including capital markets activities, mortgage originations, and credit card transactions, exceeded our
expectations, and we had one of our strongest quarters in fee revenue. We realized investment gains of $78
million, which includes $70 million from repositioning the securities portfolio. While these transactions were
primarily focused on agency mortgage-backed securities, part of the repositioning included the disposition of our
remaining $150 million in collateralized loan obligations in the investment portfolio.
Total net mortgage revenue was $24 million, which was $11 million more than the previous quarter. This is the
result of an all-time high of $635 million in secondary mortgage production and an elevated gain on sale. Looking
forward to the third quarter, we do not expect net mortgage revenue to stay at the record level of the second
quarter. Led by normalization of mortgage revenue, we believe a reduction of adjusted non-interest revenue in the
third quarter is likely before we see a return to consistent growth in fee revenue.
Non-interest expense of $284 million or $276 million adjusted is shown on slide 8. As expected, we had
approximately $7 million in COVID-related expenses in the second quarter. These included bonuses to certain
frontline team members, as well as efforts to improve the safety of our team members and customers.
Adjustments for the quarter of $8 million included expenses of $3 million related to branch closures and
restructuring of corporate real estate, as well as $5 million in expenses related to the Global One earn out liability.
Adjusted expenses included the $7 million in COVID-related expenses, as well as an increase in commission
expense $7 million higher than the prior quarter due to elevated mortgage production. The second quarter also
had $7 million in upfront expenses related to efforts we've made to implement and execute certain Synovus
Forward initiatives. These efforts will help us achieve sustainable top quartile performance that Kevin will provide
an update for shortly.
Consistent with prior guidance, we expect the expenses to decline in the second half of the year. Current credit
ratios, shown at the top of slide 9, which include NPAs, NPLs, and past dues, remain stable. We generally expect
some pressure on these credit metrics over the next few quarters, which aligns with the reserve builds in the first
half of the year under the pro-cyclical nature of CECL. Although loan deferrals have an impact on these metrics,
it's important to note that we are not seeing any widespread deterioration in the portfolio, and these ratios remain
at or near lows for this credit cycle. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, up 4 basis points from the prior
quarter. Net charge-offs of $24 million largely resulted from a single credit that was moved to non-accrual last
quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Provision for credit losses of $142 million resulted in an allowance build of nearly $120 million from the current
expectation for longer-term economic headwinds. After adjusting for P3 loans, the ACL ratio increased 35 basis
points to 1.74%. The economic assumptions for the current quarter include the estimated impact of stimulus and
an unemployment rate declining to around 10% by the end of the year and remaining elevated throughout 2021.
We anticipate moderate economic expansion following the dramatic spikes in real GDP expected in the second
and third quarters of the year.
Economic uncertainty remains great due in part to the direct impact of COVID. The ACL ratio could remain
elevated due to this economic uncertainty and credit migration, which could result in today's allowance for credit
losses not fully funding future charge-offs.
Slide 10 includes a review of our capital position as we ended the second quarter. Our focus remains on diligently
managing our balance sheet and capital in alignment with our risk appetite and capital adequacy process. And
you can see the result of that effort in our capital ratios. CET1 improved 20 basis points to 8.9%, and total risk-
based capital rose 41 basis points to 12.7%, the highest level in two years. Actions included student loan sales
and the settlement of security trades in July will further reduce risk-weighted assets and will benefit CET1 by
approximately 20 basis points in the third quarter.
As it relates specifically to common shareholder dividends, we continue to be guided by two considerations:
capital adequacy and long-term earnings. We remain confident in our current capital levels, which is supported by
stress testing and sensitivity analysis. We believe it's important for shareholders to receive current income on their
investment and also for us to retain enough capital for our strategic growth objectives. To achieve those
objectives, a total long-term payout ratio of 70% to 80% is appropriate with approximately half of that coming from
common shareholder dividends.
Before handing off to Kevin, I'd like to summarize our thoughts on the balance sheet. We remain confident in our
capital position, and the second quarter has shown we have the means to further support capital when needed.
From December 31 to June 30, we increased our allowance by approximately $400 million while maintaining a
stable CET1 ratio.
Given the elevated uncertainty, we are not planning to repurchase shares in 2020 and will use future earnings to
build capital and grow our businesses. We expect our primary means of capital return to be through dividends and
accretion of our tangible book value.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to speak further on our efforts to assist customers through this environment, give
enhanced detail within our credit portfolio, and an update on our progress within Synovus Forward.

President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll begin on slide 11 with an update to the segments we highlighted on the last call that we
defined as particularly sensitive to COVID-19. Balances totaled $4.7 billion in these industries, which is stable with
the prior quarter.
When we implemented a 90-day deferral program in late March, we utilized a review process, particularly on our
larger customers to assess the impact of the economic conditions that warranted a deferment to help address
short-term changes in cash flow. As these deferrals end, we have once again taken a proactive approach and
conducted thorough cash burn analyses on our customers to determine who will continue to see reduced levels of
cash flows over the next 90 and 180 days.

Synovus Financial Corp.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
What we found is that a large percentage of the companies experiencing a longer-term impact to cash flows are
encompassed in five of the segments identified on this slide. Let me touch on each industry briefly. I'll start with
the hotel industry, which continues to see a 40% to 60% decrease in occupancy and revenue per available room.
Given the reopenings in the southeast and the increase in occupancy in various drivable vacation destinations,
we expect cash flows to increase somewhat in the coming months. And as a result, the overall deferral rate of the
hotel portfolio to range between 30% and 40% in the next 90 days. As we shared last quarter, this portfolio
maintains a strong loan to value, slightly over 50%, and it entered the downturn with almost 2 times debt service
coverage.
For non-grocery anchored shopping centers, we expect to see deferments in the range of 20% to 30% as certain
types of retail are performing well, such as home improvement and electronics, while other retail reopens and
resumes their sources of revenue.
Moving to restaurants, this industry benefited greatly from the P3 program, and we are seeing more significant
improvements in the quick-serve and fast casual businesses, which will lead to a reduction in second-round
deferrals. However, we continue to see a lag in revenue recapture in full-service and drinking establishments.
Similar to shopping centers, the impact on the retail trade industry is largely a function of the type of goods sold,
but we are seeing an improvement here as well, with overall cash flows increasing in June versus the previous
year with solid growth in beer and wine, furniture, and grocery related-trade. And, therefore, we expect 10% to
20% of the portfolio to pursue a second round of principal and interest deferments.
Fitness, recreation, and entertainment centers are among the industries hardest hit by the shutdown, but golf
courses and country clubs are faring better. Despite the softness in some of the entertainment industries, we do
expect this industry to have low percentage of second-round deferments.
Our oil-related segment totaling approximately $300 million in outstandings was initially of greater concern due to
the negative oil futures and the impact of less travel. Despite those concerns, we saw a lower percentage of first-
round deferments and expect this portfolio to continue to perform well with minimal second-round deferments. In
aggregate, while deferral trends are positive to this point, we are keenly aware that any additional mandated
closings from the COVID surges in our markets would have the potential of impacting cash flows and, therefore,
increasing the need for additional deferments.
At this point, I would like to draw your attention to slide 25 in the appendix. Another notable segment that is often
discussed as a COVID-impacted industry that is not on this list is our senior housing portfolio, which is over $2
billion in outstandings. We have not included senior housing on this slide based on the solid performance of this
portfolio and our outlook on future performance.
The reason for exclusion is supported by the fact that we have only seen 4% of the outstanding balances deferred
in round one, which was comprised of five loans and the expectation at this time is that we will have no further
deferments in the portfolio during round two. In addition, we continue to work closely with our customers and the
industry associations, as well as actively monitor cash flows, which have trended down only modestly to date.
Our senior housing portfolio primarily includes private pay facilities that had better access to resources including
staffing and equipment. This portfolio is led by a very seasoned team with a stellar track record dealing with
longtime operators. The portfolio carries strong LTVs and debt service coverage metrics and is strategically

aligned with sponsors who have access to liquidity and have demonstrated commitment to the space over several
decades.
In terms of overall portfolio deferments, a significant percentage of our first 90 day deferrals have expired. And at
this point, we are seeing a relatively low level of additional request, which is partially due to the timing of payment
due dates.
As of July 14, 2.3% of the total loan portfolio was in a 90-day deferral status. We will continue to gain additional
insights in the coming weeks, but based upon current conditions, activity to date and ongoing discussions with our
customers, as Kessel mentioned earlier, we believe this percentage could increase into the range of 3% to 5%
this quarter. The process for granting a second deferral takes into consideration the borrower's current financial
condition and liquidity, the impact to the borrowers industry from COVID-19 and the performance history of the
borrower pre-COVID.
The strength of our portfolio coming into the crisis combined with the assistance from deferrals and government
stimulus programs should help many customers weather this storm and help to minimize defaults. Combining
these actions with strong loan-to-values and good sponsorship should help to mitigate and limit future losses.
Moving to slide 12. This is an example of the analyses we've conducted to identify and assess the financial
strength of our borrowers. This work is supported by our commercial portfolio transaction data where we have the
primary operating accounts. Approximately two-thirds of our commercial loan exposures have an operating
account open with us, and we have been comparing their cash inflows, which can serve as a proxy for revenues
on a year-over-year basis to assess and predict their ability to repay debt during this crisis.
Using this data, we have validated the impact to cash inflows between our customers who received the deferral
and those who have not, as well as the pace of improvement. Our customers overall had experienced improved
cash flows since the trough in April with the month of June exhibiting only a 6% reduction in cash inflows relative
to the same month last year. This analysis is constructive in evaluating current conditions, but more importantly, it
enables a more real-time analysis versus traditional underwriting criteria and provides a prediction of cash flows
throughout the current economic cycle. The predictive analytics allows us to determine which customers require
intervention and whether, for example, a deferral or bridge facility could provide the support needed to
supplement short-term cash flow disruption. It also provides early identification of customers where the outlook is
less optimistic, thereby allowing us to take earlier action to reduce and mitigate losses.
As we turn from credit to slide 13, before I talk about the future, let me briefly touch on the present. Despite the
challenging environment, our businesses continue to perform well. You have heard from Kessel and Jamie on the
financial results this quarter. And those results reflect the ongoing success we have across our geography and
our business units.
I want to highlight several areas that continue to perform at a high level in this difficult economy. First, as we have
mentioned several times on today's call, our mortgage business produced $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
which was up $900 million or 164% over the first quarter of this year. Yes, the low rate environment helped drive
volume, but it's important to also note that mortgage loan originators recruited since January 2018 have produced
42% of the year-to-date volume. Successful recruiting in the past two years has also proven to be a key factor in
our mortgage growth.
Second, we continue to bolster our balance sheet and P&L through productivity gains. With mortgage and
wholesale banking leading the way, second quarter funded loan production was up 43% versus the same quarter
9

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
last year. And deposit production with increases in all of our lines of business was up 37% versus second quarter
2019.
The deposit growth is a great example of how our relationship-based model continues to deliver results. This
quarter's results reflect the growth in both balances and accounts. It is a function of new customers being gained
through the PPP process, new talent that we've added, as well as thorough, consistent prospecting efforts, while
continuing to see existing customers augment their balances.
Next, as we've also shared in the past, we have been aggressively adding talent and new services in our treasury
and payment solutions area. As a result, production revenue of $2.9 million in the quarter was up 210% versus
the second quarter of 2019.
Lastly, our Global One premium finance business unit continues to generate strong growth, while improving
returns and the overall efficiency of operations. As a result of this continued success and the successful
integration within Synovus, we have expanded the responsibility of the executive leadership to now lead our
specialty finance division, which includes structured lending and asset base lending.
Underlying all of these results, we have seen more significant year-to-date growth in markets where we have
made substantial investments in talent, in marketing, and in distribution channels. Markets such as Atlanta,
Tampa, Miami, Birmingham, and Greenville, South Carolina, drive a large portion of our overall growth.
And speaking of talent, we have continued to selectively attract top talent and growth markets throughout this
quarter across all of our businesses. We have achieved these results, while our customer satisfaction scores and
our branches and our contact centers remain quite high, and they've actually increased versus historical levels. All
of these areas, as well as others I have not mentioned, give me great confidence in our ability to win. And when
we return to a state of normalcy, we will be even better positioned to do so.
As I close, let me transition to our Synovus Forward initiative, which we've highlighted on slide 13. We remain
focused on the execution of this program to drive incremental efficiencies and sources of new revenue in 2020
and beyond. Our financial objective of an incremental $100 million in pre-tax income remains intact, with the
efficiency benefits being realized early in 2021, while the revenue benefits will continue to build throughout next
year.
Our work on one of our largest expense initiatives, our third-party spend, concluded last week. This work stream
was accelerated and has proven to be quite fruitful with the identified savings from the renegotiation and demand
management efforts yielding savings of around $25 million. These benefits will be fully realized in our run rate
expenses in 2021. We have also completed Phase 1 of our branch consolidation in corporate real estate
optimization efforts and are diligently working on subsequent opportunities that will result in additional savings in
2021. We remain confident in our ability to generate $45 million to $65 million in expense savings through this
program.
While we have focused more intently on the efficiency initiatives out of the gate, we have also turned our attention
to the revenue opportunities that were identified during the diagnostic phase with the total potential pre-tax
income of between $35 million and $55 million. Analytics enhancement is at the center of many of these
opportunities. As I mentioned previously during the second quarter, we utilized the resources on this work stream
to build out our credit analytics and predictive modeling capabilities to create early warning mechanisms that will
allow us to take actions to mitigate and reduce credit losses. We will benefit from this work in the coming quarters,

but this work will also serve as the baseline analytic framework to generate advancements in our sales and our
service activities, as well as improvements in our overall relationship profitability.
Moreover, as we enter 2021, we will be in a better position to optimize the pricing of our depository and treasury
products and solutions through the deployment of new tools and processes. We will maintain a dedicated team to
continue to lead this work, and we'll also remain flexible to adjustments and additions to the overall program. This
work serves as our North Star as we prioritize future investments and determine needs to continue to differentiate
Synovus in what is becoming an increasingly competitive landscape. We also recognize the uncertainty in the
environment and the subsequent impact to financial results, which may lead to a change in the scope and the
sizing of the program. And the management team is fully committed to execution and the delivery of the results.
With those comments, now let me turn it back over to Kessel to begin the Q&A portion of our program.

So, thank you, Kevin. And before I go to Q&A, I just want to close by thanking our team. I had the privilege last
week of participating in our mortgage company town hall meeting where they were celebrating a quarter of not
only record production, but significant increases in customer satisfaction surveys.
And I said to them what I'll say to our entire team today. I've never been more proud to be associated with the
Synovus team, and I continue to be inspired by not only what they do, but how they do it, putting our customers
first in all that they do each and every day.
And in spite of all the challenges and uncertainties facing our industry, we continue to attract and retain the very
best talent in the industry.
And now, operator, I'd like to open the floor for questions.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, I wanted to start with the expense base. I mean on an adjusted point of view it was $276 million this quarter.
You talk about expenses going down in the back half of the year. Maybe just talk about the magnitude of how
much of the decline we could see there. And then, that's good news on the third-party spend, $25 million, it seems
like that was a little more than you all were anticipating. And now you're looking at the branch side, it feels like
with the new backdrop of COVID you can maybe find a little bit more than you were expecting there too, maybe
just talk about the possible upside on finding more expenses than initially expected other than Synovus Forward
plan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brady. Hey, it's Jamie. Good morning. As we look at expenses in the second half of this year, there are lot
of ebbs and flows. We do expect expenses to be lower. That would be predominately led by personnel expense
declines. That's also assuming that mortgage revenues don't stay at the high levels we experienced in the second
quarter, but we expect that to normalize as well. As you mentioned we continue to focus on real estate. We
closed six branches in the first half of the year, and we're expecting to close another seven in the second half of
the year. So, we're active there, and we're also reviewing our non-branch real estate.
As you are aware, we're all learning a lot about how to use non-branch real estate in this environment. And so,
we're reassessing everything these days, and we believe that there are opportunities there. You're right on the
third-party spend initiative. That has performed better than expected. We're always pleased when we can find
additional cost saves in third-party spend and we've done that. Those days will come in over the next few
quarters. They're not immediate just because some of the contracts, they don't renew immediately, and so we'll
see that come in over the next few quarters, but we're very pleased with that.
We still believe that the expense save range of $45 million to $65 million makes sense for Synovus Forward. But I
will say that we're constantly reassessing. This is an evolving environment. We're looking at longer term into 2021

and performance – the performance outlook. And our strategies will evolve as the environment evolves. I will just
remind that we came up with Synovus Forward and launched it in a very different operating environment. We had
a growing economy, and the outlook has changed significantly. And so, as outlook changes, our strategies will
change. And so, you should expect to see that.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then my second last question is just on the dividend. With the stock trading with a 7.5% dividend yield,
it just continues to be a big investor focus. If you look at reported earnings of $0.57 this quarter, and just a great
quarter, it feels like you should be more comfortable with the dividend after 2Q? Is that a fair assumption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, we are comfortable with our dividend. But we've – as you know, we look at it in two different
capacities. We look at capital adequacy, and we look at long-term earnings and the payment ratio. And so, with
capital adequacy, as I look at where we are today, we're right at our 9% CET1 target. That target is informed by
stress testing. And if you look at severe adverse scenarios over a nine-quarter period, we expect capital
degradation of around 2.3%.
We also took a look at losses in the most recent DFAST results and put those on our portfolio at the product level
and you come up with a similar capital degradation when you look at that kind of external view. So, we feel good
about a 9% CET1. But what I'll say is that when we ran our stress test and that capital degradation, we didn't have
near the allowance that we have today.
And so, we've built this allowance while maintaining capital, and we ended the quarter at 8.9%. But as I
mentioned in the prepared remarks, the transactions that have closed and settled since quarter-end will add
approximately another 20 basis points to common equity Tier 1. And so, we feel really good about where we are
with regards to capital at this stage.
And then with regards to earnings and the payout ratio, we believe that it's appropriate to have 70% to 80% total
payout ratio. We want to retain capital for growth. We believe very strongly in the opportunity for Synovus in the
southeast and we – organic capital generation is the best way to have capital to go out there and grow customers
and grow the bank. So, we want to retain capital generated through earnings for growth, but we also believe that
investors have the right and desire of current income. And so, we weigh both of those. We look at our forecast
and we look at our total payout ratio and our dividend payout ratio. And dividend payout ratio is elevated versus
our targets over the foreseeable future, but it is not restrictive of our strategic plan. And so, we feel good about
where we are.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. I guess a really quick question in terms of slide 11, obviously, the amount of deferrals that you
expected of round two were significantly less than what they are in round one. But can you talk about the lost
content when we think about those round-two deferrals? Obviously, they are the weaker credits that asking for
more time, does the loss content presumably go up dramatically on those or how are you thinking about that?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi Ken, this is Bob. I'll try to answer that on the strategic industries or COVID-sensitive industries that Kevin
pointed out. But when you start thinking about loss content, I mean clearly, we are modeling various scenarios
there, but back to Kevin's point about cash flows in his comments, early indications are that our sensitive book
has moved back closer to the breakeven cash flow line.
So, again, you start thinking about how do you model and run various scenarios. So, clearly, hotels and shopping
centers from a CRE perspective we believe would be the most impacted when you think about looking at third and
fourth quarter, looking at these second deferrals, from a loss content, specifically obviously, I don't – I can't give
you a complete estimate. But we're modeling various scenarios and feel good about where we are today as it
relates to those portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. And Ken, I'll just add, Bob mentioned some of the analysis we're doing. When you look at it at a broad
level, we only have a very small percentage of our customers, 1%, 2%, 3%, that would have a cash financing
need in the next 90 to 180 days. And that's where we're evaluating, whether it'd be additional stimulus that would
come from the government or whether it would be the existing plans through Main Street lending or other bridge
facilities that would bridge that gap.
So, to Bob's point, it's a very small percentage, and when you look at the cash inflows and how they've come
back in June, it's really going to be a wait-and-see as we look into the future and see what July, August and
September hold for many of these industries, and what would happen if there is a surge in cases and there would
be a return to lower levels of cash inflow. So, Bob said it well. It's unknown at this point, but we do feel like we
ring-fence the risk, and we have a good estimate of where the risk is coming from and we're doing everything we
can now to mitigate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just my follow-up question staying with credit. I think Jamie mentioned, had a sentence in
his prepared remarks that essentially said the ACL could remain elevated and essentially might not fully offset
future charge-offs. I get it if the economy deteriorates from here. That totally makes sense.
But given CECL, like your charge-off should more than cover all your reserve should cover all your anticipated
charge-offs that you do expect given today's expectation, and we've certainly heard from other banks, one in
particular said that they think the second quarter's the peak in their reserve ratio and it should start to decline
given what they're expecting. Is there anything different with your portfolio that – or is that sort of a throwaway

comment that provisions – that reserves aren't going to fully cover charge-offs? I just want to make sure I don't
misread that in any way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ken, it's Jamie. You're thinking about it exactly right. That comment is just really is around the uncertainty in this
environment. Obviously, we believe that our allowance today covers us for the charge-offs embedded in our book
life of loan losses. And so, we feel good about that. However, it's just highly uncertain and we will be constantly
reassessing that as we go through the next few quarters by looking at both economic outlook and risk rating
migration.

Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess, sticking with on the deferral renewals, are you able to get any type of concessions or enhancements
more broadly from the loans that are going to be going into the second round of deferrals? I guess, how are you
looking at actually approaching the renewals, whether it's in the COVID-sensitive industries or whether it's just
more broadly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jared, this is Bob. Just a quick comment on the deferral process that I think can add some color to
that for you. That process obviously does entail us addressing each credit on a loan-by-loan basis, certainly on
the larger wholesale accounts. In that process, we clearly are looking at modifications to the note, changes to the
collateral, changes to recourse, et cetera. So, you get sort of a re-underwriting, to some degree, effect on that
credit. It also gets a refresh on risk grade, et cetera.
And kind of to Jamie's point earlier, there's migration involved there too. So, it's a pretty detailed look at a specific
credit in order to grant a second deferral. Now, some of the smaller credits, to Kevin Blair's point earlier, we're
using a lot of data analytics that is helping us drive those decisions for second deferral. So, it's lot harder to do
deep dives on the smaller portfolios, but we're also not just granting them without looking at some data as well.

Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, to your point, we're getting guarantees where it makes sense. We're taking extra collateral. We're getting
fees. So, not only are we protecting ourselves from a risk standpoint, we're trying to benefit the P&L at the same
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then on that risk migration that you mentioned, so on some of those, we could potentially see some
incremental level of charge-off at the renewal of the deferral if that underwriting or those values didn't hold up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jared, I guess – this is Bob again. I think theoretically you could. But remember, we're still early in the
process and I think we did see some migration in our rated book, as you saw. But with the amount of liquidity out
there and what we're seeing and talking specifically with our customers, particularly our larger accounts, is that
that will probably be a few quarters down the road before we begin to see to what level charge-offs begin to
materialize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then I guess my second question, could you give a little more detail on the securities
repositioning, where you're seeing, where you're reinvesting cash flows at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jared. This is Jamie. With the securities portfolio, as we look – we came into the second quarter, interest
rates obviously declined. If you looked at the mortgage refinancing index, it was spiking. We had our own
production, was increasing. And we looked at the portfolio and we had a significant amount of securities in the
portfolio where we saw elevated prepay risk, and we had a gain – unrealized gain on those securities and we
decided that it was better to take those gains, realize them, move that income forward and reduce prepay risk.
And so, we did that in the securities portfolio. If you look at the portfolio at quarter-end, the book yield was
approximately 2.4%. The going on yield for new investments these days is approximately 1.5%. And so, that's the
rationale behind the transaction. We will continuously evaluate that portfolio and look at market dynamics as we
think about how to manage it going forward. But that's the background on that.

Jared Shaw Q

Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Kevin, I just wanted you to maybe talk a little bit more about the slide 12, but I thought that was interesting.
Just want to make sure I clearly understand. This covers about 65% of your loan portfolio and it's really based on
changes and sort of, kind of what you're looking at in terms of operating deposit accounts or are you actually
looking at real-time cash flow statements from customers to drive the data that's on slide 12. Just wanted to kind
of understand that a little more clearly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brad, it's the former. So, we're looking at their operating accounts to evaluate what the cash inflows are
and, quite frankly, the outflows in those accounts. And so we use that information. It's transaction-level data. The
reason it's 65% is that's where we don't felt comfortable with having the full relationship to be able to look at all the
inflows and outflows.
And as you stated, it gives us an opportunity to look at the static environment. So, we saw in June that there was
only a 6% reduction in inflows across the entire book. And I think it shows you that we've done a good job of
identifying those loans that needed a deferment, and that they were still down 12%, and those that didn't need a
deferment, the inflows were down only 5%.
Now, this is one side of the equation. Obviously, each of these businesses can be constraining their outflows. So,
it doesn't mean that necessarily that it's a drop to the bottom line, and as Jamie talked about in his prepared
remarks, we've actually seen an augmentation of deposit balances over this timeframe of roughly 10% on
average balances. So, it shows you even though inflows are slowing during the crisis, people are able to slow
their outflows as well.
What's most important about this data, and Bob mentioned it earlier, is with the thousands of accounts that we
have that we can't go do what you're suggesting the cash burn analysis, which we are doing on the larger credits,
17


Synovus Financial Corp.

this allows us to look at the static position, but then most importantly predict into the future knowing what the
recovery rate per industry is going to be. And so we can know 180 days or longer, 12 months out, where there's
going to be a shortfall in the cash flow, and we can take action today. So, it's good information, this static. Just
know that the most important part of it is the predictive abilities of having all that transactional data to be able to
take early action.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Is this something relatively new for Synovus, or is it things that kind of you, maybe, relied on the past that are
maybe – from your experience at SunTrust or Jamie coming from Regions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's new. We leveraged – as I mentioned on Synovus Forward, we had an analytical work stream that we were
starting that was largely focused on sales-and-service-type initiatives, and we re-diverted those resources to take
all of our analytical resources internally and a third party to develop out this predictive model during the second
quarter.
So, it's new. And the good news is, Brad, it's going to not only serve as a great platform for credit analytics. That
same transactional data will allow us to do service and sales leads and other types of relationship-building
predictive modeling that will be coming in the latter half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then just one final follow-up related to margin. Jamie, you mentioned over the next several quarters
getting interest-bearing deposit cost down to the third quarter 2014 levels. Do you feel like this environment and
kind of where you are with the Florida franchise, will kind of allow you to sort of equate those two deposit bases to
one another, in other words, bring that mix more in line with legacy Synovus in terms of cost or is Florida market
where you still have to pay up to some degree to continue to use funding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. First, as you look at mix, we have largely achieved returning to the pre-FCB Synovus deposit mix. And so,
we're pretty pleased with that. And we included a chart showing the relative cost to our third quarter 2014 lows,
really did show where the opportunity lies and it's in our time deposit book. When we look at our core time
deposits, we have $2.8 billion that mature in the second half of this year. The average rate on those maturities is
somewhere around 1.75%.
Our going on rate on time deposits is over 100 basis points lower. And so, we do have line of sight into how we
are going to attack that deposit cost. It's largely in the time deposit book. I mentioned core time deposits. We also
have the opportunity in public funds. We also have the opportunity in broker time. And then there's still some
opportunity left in interest-bearing transaction deposits, but the larger opportunity is in time deposits.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Two questions. You mentioned your net charge-offs this quarter were driven by largely by one credit. What
industry was that in and what was the severity of loss on that loan? And then my second question is, can you
share with us your criticized loan levels in your more pandemic-sensitive loans that you outlined in the deck?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jennifer, it's Bob. As Jamie mentioned, that was one credit, it was in aviation. We've been working
through that credit now for a few quarters. We think we recognize the loss content and goes through our normal
impairment process, et cetera. So, we don't want to talk about specific credits, but that one's flowing through the
normal process.
As it relates to your question about migration and the sensitivity or the sensitive industries within that migration,
obviously that's – there is some correlation there to our increase in criticized [indiscernible] (00:55:41) would
correlate somewhat back to mainly the hotel and shopping center portfolio as I mentioned earlier, specifically in
terms of what percentage I couldn't tell you, but it is a little bit correlated there.
We expect that to continue. But as Kevin Blair mentioned, we think we've got a pretty good ring fence around
those aggregate dollars, and we'll go through our modeling to kind of predict that out as it flows forward. But we're
taking the charge through the ACL as you know today with the CECL reserve.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Yes. This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. Just had a question on the reserve. How much of that $650 million
reserve is allocated to the CRE portfolio, and how much of the reserve was released tied to the student and the
GreenSky loans move to held for sale?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As you look at the student loan transaction, that was approximately $13 million in allowance release
associated with that portfolio. And so, when you think about our total provision or total provision cost in the
quarter, we would have assumed that you would had – the incremental $13 million build on that.
What was the other part of your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. How much of the total reserve was allocated to the CRE portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We have not disclosed that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then just one question on the – on expenses, just thinking about it little differently. So, the adjusted
efficiency ratio has hovered around 57% to 58% in the first half of this year. In the past, you've talked about in
longer term efficiency target probably in the low to mid 50% range. You obviously have the revenue and the
expense initiatives ongoing. When do you expect to reach that level in terms of efficiency ratio or do you have like
an updated target for us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me just run through the different components of that to give an idea of how we're looking at it because
it's a highly uncertain environment. And so, we have not updated or put targets out there, updated targets for this
environment. So, when you look at revenue, and I'll just start with interest income we're forecasting the margin
when you incorporate the 9 basis point impact of the transactions we've discussed and then you exclude the
impact of PPP, we expect the margin to be flat.
But when you think about interest income over the second half of the year it will likely be up due to the
forgiveness of PPP loans. And so, I would expect interest income in the second half of the year to be higher. We
would expect fee revenue NIR to be down, and we would expect that to be just because the first half of the year
was so strong specifically in mortgage. And so, when you look at total revenue, I would say flat to slightly up for
the second half of the year. And then, as we've discussed, we expect expenses to be down. As we get to the
longer term, we're committed to top-quartile performance to delivering a strong return for our shareholders. But
we're not at a spot to say what our target is or where we expect to be longer term.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And appreciate all the detail this morning. Just to follow-up on
that last one, Jamie. There's clearly a number of moving pieces with PPP fees, excess liquidity, and the deposit or
pricing opportunity. How do you expect NII, excluding PPP fees to trend over the back half of the year, and where
do you think it's stabilizes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. My expectation for the second half of the year is that NII is higher inclusive of PPP fees. When you back
those out, however, I would go back to the margin guidance and basically say that when you include PPP fees,
we're going to have a 9 basis points headwind due to the transactions we've discussed.
And then we have – offsetting the headwinds from fixed rate asset repricing and the tailwinds of deposit repricing.
And we think those are going to net to a push. There'll also be a benefit – we had an average of approximately
$1.5 billion of cash at the fed in the second quarter. We expect that to be lower. That's not certain. But we would
expect that to be a tailwind to the margin, won't impact NII. But those are the moving pieces as we think about NII
in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just quickly, I guess what pressure does the pandemic operating backdrop
put on the timing for Synovus Forward benefit? Clearly, there's better visibility for third-party expense and real
estate savings. But do you feel good about your flexibility to increase those expense synergies if the revenue
benefits don't materialize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take that, Garrett. This is Kevin. Look, we've said, it's a very flexible and scalable program where we
evaluated over 20 different initiatives during the diagnostic phase. We decided to move forward with several
expense reduction initiatives that we call funding the journey. Obviously, we believe – in the second half of this
year and early next year, we believe there's opportunities to generate incremental revenues. We've talked about
the $35 million to $55 million range.
We remain confident in that and those initiatives really revolve around analytics and pricing for value. But as you
know, the top line and the initiatives are to generate $100 million in pre-tax income. So, as certain initiatives will
ebb and flow, we're going to be able to adjust on both sides of the ledger, whether it's revenue or expense. And
I'm equally as optimistic as we have announced on this first initiative on the third-party spend that the rest of our
efficiency initiatives will be successful. And I'm optimistic that many of the revenue initiatives will also be
successful.
But as Jamie mentioned earlier, based on the environment overall, we may have to scale up the program in
general. But we'll continue to keep a dedicated team focused on it, and we'll have a focus not only towards the
21

Good morning.

Anthony Elian Q

...good morning. I had a question on credit. A couple of your southeast peers in recent days have called out one-
off charge-offs in restaurant and energy? I just wanted to get a sense of anything of note you guys are seeing in
either of these portfolios? Understand that there is small composition of your overall loan portfolio, but just wanted
to see if there's anything of note that you're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Thanks. This is Bob again on specifically on energy. That portfolio is relatively small. I think we disclosed it in
less than $300 million range. We haven't seen any specific credit degradation there. Most of our exposure is not
related to exploration and production. It's more related to transportation and support industries.
And then specifically, I think on the restaurants that you called out, a lot of our portfolio is drive through, quick
serve-type restaurants. Most of those are smaller ones. We probably will see some credit migration in that
portfolio. But that's a book that's primarily built around our community bankers, it's built around customers that
we've known for a long time in our markets, and we feel like we're really close and talking to those customers on a
routine basis and feel okay about where we are. But certainly in that portfolio, you could see that credit migrate
over a period of time.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Okay. And one follow-up for me. Of the $4.5 billion of core transaction deposit growth we saw in the quarter. How
much of this came from non-PPP activity, and can you estimate what percentage of these balances are sticky in
nature? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's difficult to attribute the deposit growth exactly, but we would say that, I think we can tie about $2.2
billion, $2.3 billion to PPP borrowing. And as we look at it, and this is not comprehensive, but we would say that
somewhere between 10% and 20% of the cash from PPP has been utilized. And so, it's less than we would
originally imagine at the beginning of the program, but that's where it currently stands.
The stickiness of the deposits for the second half of this year is difficult to model just because this is pretty
unprecedented in a new environment. And so, we are remaining conservative on how we manage the balance
sheet, how we look at cash on the balance sheet and expected outflows, but it's our expectation that these
balances do remain on the balance sheet for the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Jamie, if I could just add one more point to that, in PPP, obviously we're going to get some balances that
leave us. But the other important part we have, this is also in the appendix, we were able to generate 1,900 new
relationships from the PPP program. And although it originated only $229 million in PPP balances, we've been
able to garner a full relationship from those new customers. And so, there will be balances that come to us that
will not leave. So, not only will we be able to take advantage of the PPP program and the fees from that, but we've
now generated almost 2,000 new relationships as a result.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Just on the capital degradation under your stress test, the 2.3%. So, if that was to occur, that would take your
CET1 to say the low to mid-7%. If you were to assume that you – to build the CET1 next few quarters, is that a
range that you guys would be willing – you want to still keep the dividend if it got to say around a 7.5% level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Steven, as we think about capital and how do we manage in that adverse environment, I mean, that's a
hypothetical scenario that if we had perfect foresight, our dividends generate about 40 basis point – common
dividend is about 40 basis points of capital per year. And so, that's about the impact of if you were to pivot from
$0.33 a quarter down to $0.01 or to zero. And so, it's not tremendously material, obviously in a severe adverse
scenario, where you're taking your hands off the wheel like the stress tests assume. You won't every piece of
capital, but at 40 basis points per year is not tremendous. If you had perfect foresight and you saw a scenario like
that happening where earnings were depressed for an extended period of time, obviously, we would consider our
dividend policy.
But as we've shown in the first half this year, the stress test assumptions of total hands off the wheel around
managing your own balance sheet are not accurate with what we would do. You can see by our actions in the
second quarters that we're going to actively manage our balance sheet. We have the means and the ability to
improve capital and manage capital through adverse environments. And you see that with the student loan sale,
you see us generating capital and building reserves at the same time. And so, we feel good about that. And I think
that's how we would look at this severe adverse scenario, which is it's not too dissimilar from how we look at the
balance sheet today. We're focused on accreting capital today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. That was – I mean, it's really great to see this quarter that the amount of capital you guys were able to
generate. And then just a follow-up to that, after we get through this credit cycle, we are in a really first-of-a-kind
interest rate environment. I guess how does – how are you guys thinking about the future margin and your PPNR
and able to maintain your dividend based on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we look at longer term, as I've said, we've given guidance of the margin being flat once you adjust for
that 9 basis points for the transaction as excluding PPP. And we believe that we have opportunities on the liability
side to offset the kind of persistent pressure we will get due to fixed rate assets both mortgage loans and
mortgage securities repricing over time.
And so, when we think about our margin, we see it as fairly stable given those inputs and assumptions. And we
look at the balance sheet, we expect loans to be fairly flat over the second half of the year. And so, those are our
core assumptions for NII. We believe NIR, we still have the teams and the customer base to have strong growth
there. And so, we think about PPNR or just total revenue, we feel it's either strength in NIR. NII we expect will
have a combination of a fairly flat margin and truthfully fairly flat loans for second half of the year.

Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Jamie, I'll give you – Jamie gave you some of the financial response, but I would just add from a business
standpoint. We feel like we're well-situated in the southeast to continue to grow once we get to your point on the

other side of this environment. We think that we've been able to add talent in the last several years that was
proving out in the first quarter before we hit the pandemic that we were seeing elevated levels of growth. And so,
I'm very confident in our bank's ability to continue to take share and win business, and that's going to be the
differentiator in this world that we live in. If it's a flat rate environment everyone's going to be sitting there with
lower margins. And so, those banks that can generate growth through acquisition and customers and expansion
are going to be the ones that outperform and we're confident we'll be able to do that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess the question actually for Kessel. You mentioned that – Kessel, you've been through a lot. I think
shareholders who've been with Synovus in the last decade have been through a lot, also the recovery coming out
of the last crisis, I'd love to get your thoughts as the Chairman of the Board around the dividend. I appreciate the
dividend payout ratio and targeting 30% to 40%. There could be a chance you remain at a much higher level for
the foreseeable future. But if you're a shareholder of the company, it feels like there's a lot of judgment call that
would be involved. And I'd love to get your thoughts around, again, if the macro gets much worse for the entire
industry I get that. But if it doesn't, it seems like your messaging is creating a lot more idiosyncratic risk around
Synovus' dividend outlook. I'd love for you to address that, Kessel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim. I think I got most of that question, and happy to do that. And thanks for calling on because our
team was starting to think I was not a participant today, so thank you for that. Look, as Chairman of the Board, I
am totally in sync and connected with the message that Jamie just delivered. As a matter of fact, I think Sunday
morning at 7:00 AM, Jamie, Kevin, and I were on a call looking at not just this year, next year, looking at some of
the same test that the Fed has laid out for larger banks in terms of a rolling four-quarter average, testing the
sensitivity around that payout, both as – again, as it affects capital ratios and as it reflects on a percentage of,
again, long-term earnings.
So, you mentioned, yeah, if the industry went into a severe depression, I think all bets would be off for all of us or
at least for most of us. But today – and we present that same analysis to our board. I've noticed several of our
peers talked about the board is expected to approve. Our board is very well informed and, as Chairman, my
25

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
obligation is to make sure that we present not only Jamie's base case, but present the scenarios that could call
that into question over the long term.
So, I mean, I would love to be able to give total clarity over the next three or four years. I think, today, I think we've
laid out well based on conditions today, based on the quality of our credit, the build of our reserve, the capital
levels, our ability to flex this quarter and, quite frankly, beyond to make sure that capital ratios stay at well-
capitalized levels. Jamie mentioned another 20 basis points already this quarter in CET1 based on actions taken
to date.
So, again, totally in lock-step. We don't have a management view and a board view, but I, again, as Chairman,
make sure our board sees not just our analysis, but the board is very well informed by third-party investment
banks that run their own models, their own stress test, their own scenarios. So, today, again, we feel confident in
the level of the dividend, but as, again, I think all of my peers have said on every call, there is a lot of uncertainty
in the market over the long term.
So, we'll continue to update investors every quarter on our view. And certainly, if it were to change, we would
inform not only on this call, but every opportunity we get. Transparency has always been very key to us. And I
hope, from Jamie's explanation and mine, you feel that we're happy to follow up. But totally in sync with Jamie,
Kevin's comments, again, on credit, on capital, and on dividend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
No. So, I think that was helpful. Thank you. And just very quick follow-up, Jamie, that the CET1 [ph] 9.1%
(01:15:54), it's not the highest, but it's a pretty healthy level. What do you expect for the CET1 to trend, like do you
think that ratio goes higher from here? And are there other actions that you could do to further shore up the
capital ratios if you needed to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim, CET1 could go higher from here, we would expect it to just through core earnings. That's our
number one source of capital, and as we look forward, we assume that our allowance today is appropriate. And
when you think about, if your allowance – if you're not having significant allowance bills, it's really through PPNR,
and I've given kind of the breakdown of how we view PPNR in the second half of the year. So, yes, we are not
repurchasing shares for the rest of the year. We are forecasting positive earnings and growth there. And so, we
feel good about organic capital generation in the second half of the year.
I would also point to, while it is not our plan, we do still have $200 million in unrealized gains in the securities
portfolio. So, we're not intending to transact there, but as I mentioned, that's something that we continuously
evaluate. And there's a strong rationale to reposition the portfolio. We may end up with more gains – realized
gains. And so, I would say those are the larger considerations there.

ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. And just a quick question on the mortgage business and the sort of infrastructure
spending you've done already. I know that this quarter was great and may not be sustainable. But I feel like
you've made a lot of investments to kind of position yourself well for the long term. So, I just wanted to go through
that real quick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, as you think about mortgage, obviously, about 66% of the volume this quarter was refinances, Chris. So, that
will abate somewhat going forward. We knew that there was an increase. When we think about what we've been
able to invest in over the last several years, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've been able to add mortgage
loan originators over the last two years that we think are critical for our future success. We have about $146
million at quarter-end and so, you do the math on that, they did about $10 million per LO last quarter.
So that will come back a little bit. The other – just based on the volume from a refinance perspective. But the
other wildcard is just understanding what the secondary gains are going to be in the market in the third quarter.
We had about 3.3% in margin this quarter. That was a bit elevated from what we had expected. So, I think when
you go to third quarter, you will still see a very strong production quarter. We'll have to watch margins. And that
will ultimately determine what the secondary gains will be in the third quarter. But they'll come down from the
elevated levels. I think Jamie said, the second quarter was really a record level, and it's something that we don't
expect to see for the latter part of it this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Kevin, thanks for that. And, Jamie, just a quick one on the deposit mix as you cited back on slide 5. Does
the change in the CD mix kind of take a couple more quarters to get where you wanted to go? Or how – what's
the proper timeframe to expect there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It'll take a few quarters. I would extend it a little more than a couple. But I'll just point you back to the $2.8
billion that we do have maturing year in the second half of the year. That's a significant piece of it. But you're right.
They do extend into 2021.

Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Just a follow-up on total adjusted fee income. Understand the moving parts, and I appreciate the answer to
Chris' question. As I look at some of the other line items, so, like, service charges and bank card fees, I would
expect those to continue to normalize from fee waivers and card activity, stuff like that. Jamie, should we think
about fee income on an adjusted basis actually being relatively flattish as we move into the third quarter? Would
that be your expectation? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
My expectation is actually that it declines in the third quarter. And that's really based on mortgage. This quarter in
mortgage had just under $24 million in revenue was unprecedented. And just to put a box around that, the
mortgage team produced $1.4 billion in mortgage total when you include [indiscernible] (01:20:55) we've grown
the portfolio. That $1.4 billion was larger. That individual quarter was larger than 14 of the last 22 years. So this is
really an unprecedented quarter for the team there, and we don't expect that to continue.
And so, as I look forward, total fee revenue, my expectation today is that mortgage revenue trends back towards
a longer-term mean, which is actually a somewhat material reduction. And so, that's a large – I agree with your
other comments. I would say that we would expect card activity to increase if you look at just kind of core bank
fees and NSF, that's challenging in this environment because there's so much liquidity. And so, we're not seeing a
lot of NSF fees and capital markets income and the rest, we would expect to be fairly stable to growing. But the
third quarter will see a reset from the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Very helpful. And then maybe a broader question for Kessel. As we do get to side of this credit cycle and
there is a kind of a re-intermediation of loans into the banking system from non-bank lenders given the struggles
there. How do you make sure that Synovus gets its fair share, while at the same time keep an eye on costs and
reduce some branch footprint and overhead employees, stuff like that? Kind of what – how do you see kind of the
Synovus story evolving and making sure that you have a growing place in this world? Thanks.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Yeah, Michael, great question. And again, we question ourselves on that every day. Let me start by saying this.
We believe our business model works well and is evidenced by the results, not just this quarter, but the entire
year. And it's not just evidenced by results, which I think speak for themselves, but our ability to attract and retain
talent, whether you've been with our company 40 years or 4 days, in some cases, involving someone I was
involved in recruiting last week, we continue, in my opinion, with all due respect to our peers to attract some of the
best talent in our major metro markets here in Atlanta, in Jacksonville, in South Florida, and really throughout. So
the model, our go-to-market strategy is working well. Our talent I think is the best in the industry. I mean they want
to work for our company. And I think is evidenced – the PPP process. Again, everybody try their best. So, there's
no judgment on who did better than others.
But I do think, Kevin mentioned, 1,900 new relationships. That was evidenced of – although sometimes in our
industry people think of us as a commodity. I think when times really get tough and you get into a PPP-type
process our relationship-based model and way of doing business really stood out as customers didn't want to feel
like they had gone into never-never land. They wanted a banker who could talk to them about process, where are
you, why are you there, what can you expect. So, whether it's through increasing digital channels or making sure
our branch network is optimized with the right talent or again our middle market teams, our wholesale teams, our
specialty lending teams, again, great talent led by the original leadership team from Global One. They've
expanded their leadership in our company and, again, adding, I think true expertise in areas that stand out.
End of the day, customers want to be banked by someone who knows their business very well. And I think our
model allows us to get the right banker in front of the right customer or prospect and over time add value and,
quite frankly, get paid for that value. So, we're confident in the go-forward model. We want to get through this
cycle. We want to continue to focus on credit, on efficiency, on revenue opportunities. But we're excited about
2021 and beyond recognizing the challenges of a low for long interest rate environment. We think we have a
competitive edge, and we just got to build on that and maximize that opportunity.

Well, thank you. It's been a long call. But a few comments to close up again the call today, referencing the
pandemic and social unrest. And it's hard to believe it was almost two months ago when all of us witnessed the
senseless murder of George Floyd in our own state, we saw video, the tragic killing of Ahmaud Arbery. And since
29

then, I've had countless conversations with community leaders, mentors of mine, board members, advisory board
members and Synovus leaders from the executive leadership team to the teller line. And while many of those
calls were filled with very raw emotion, all were filled with hope and encouragement for what we could do on a go-
forward basis to make a difference. And our company is fully committed to do our part and more to address
issues of racial inequality and social injustice, both internally within Synovus if it exists and in the communities
that we serve. And we're excited to soon announce a major investment in education targeted to minority students
attending college.
And, today, as the largest bank headquartered in the state of Georgia, I just want to acknowledge the passing of
one of Georgia's own, Congressman John Lewis. He's one of the nicest, kindest man I've ever met in politics or,
quite frankly, in life. He was a giant of a man and he was a true civil rights icon and a hero to our state and to our
nation. Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with his family, and he'll be missed in ways that are just truly
indescribable.
So, let me just close again by thanking our team members for their extraordinary efforts in the past few weeks. It's
been 130 days since the declaration of the national emergency on March 13 and the consequences continue to
weigh heavily on individuals, families, businesses, certainly our economy overall. No one knows when normal will
return or what it will look like when it finally does. But as we speak, our team is executing on a well-planned,
measured, safe approach to a gradual reentry to on-site locations, while we monitor conditions across our
footprint and continue to be guided first and foremost by doing what's best for the well-being of our team members
and our customers.
So, just rest assured, we're acutely aware of the times we're in and of the added responsibility we have as a
financial partner to help those who we serve both recover and prosper. So, we're fully on board. We're actively
engaged with our customers and communities, and we're prepared not only to see this crisis through, but also to
execute on our growth initiatives modified as needed to emerge with strength and a clear competitive path
forward. So, thank you, all again for your interest on our company, and thank you for joining the call today.
