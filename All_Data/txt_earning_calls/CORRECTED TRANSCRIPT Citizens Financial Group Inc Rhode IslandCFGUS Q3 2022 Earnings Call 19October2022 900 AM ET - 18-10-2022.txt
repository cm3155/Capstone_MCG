Kristin Silberberg
Executive Vice President-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan
Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide
additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations
website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the Appendix.
With that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another very
strong quarterly result in Q3. Rising rates positively impacted our net interest income and net interest margin.
Fees and expenses were broadly stable, and credit performance remains excellent.
We grew average loans 2% and deposits 1%, as our liquidity and funding position remained strong, and our CET1
ratio of 9.8% is above the midpoint of our 9.5% to 10% target range. Our TCE to total asset ratio sits at 6.1%.
Performance metrics include a net interest margin of 3.25%, and that's up 21 basis points. We had positive
sequential operating leverage of 6%. We hit efficiency ratio below 55%, and our return on tangible common equity
was around 18%. We built our credit reserves by $49 million with our ACL at 1.41%, and that's above the 1.3%
day one CECL reserve, adjusted for the Investors acquisition.
Beyond these impressive financial results, we've continued to make good progress in executing our strategic
initiatives. In consumer, we launched Citizens Private Client, which will help drive wealth opportunities. We
migrated our National Digital Bank to a modern cloud-based platform. We continue to grow share with Citizens
Pay, and we're executing well on our expansion into New York City Metro region.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
In commercial, we've successfully integrated recent acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital into our coverage and
product model. Our M&A pipelines are at record levels, and our geographic and industry vertical build-out is
delivering strong results in terms of market share gains.
Enterprise-wide, we're successfully wrapping up our TOP 7 program while building out TOP 8. Stay tuned on that.
Our NextGen Tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a game-changer for us. These
programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement, finding ways to run the bank more efficiently, so
we can deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund investments for our future.
We're also doing some interesting things in ESG such as developing our carbon offset program for clients, as well
as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy. And we have more interesting innovation in
the pipeline.
As we look forward to Q4 of 2023, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep
growing and enhancing our franchise value. We are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the
macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite, but we also
plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. The current
environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver responsible, sustainable growth.
One aspect that we emphasized in today's presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base that
we've been able to transform over time. We've had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters as
some peers are seeing outflows, and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack. We're seeing very strong
loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through 2024, assuming the current forward curve. As
a result, our NIM will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on.
We've also layered in sizeable net interest rate hedges to protect NIM and ROTCE through 2024 if the Fed
reverses and brings down short-term rates. Moving off of the zero-bound for short rates has unlocked the value of
our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our ROTCE. With a clearer macro outlook and less market
volatility, we feel the value of our commercial bank build-up will also manifest, benefiting further our ROTCE.
So, very exciting time for Citizens. And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to John to cover the financials in more
detail. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter referencing slide 5.
We reported underlying net income of $669 million and EPS of $1.30. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was
17.9%. Net interest income was up 11% linked quarter, driven by a 21-basis-point improvement in margin to
3.25%, and 2% growth in average interest-earning assets.
Average loans are up 2% linked quarter with 3% growth in commercial. Fees were fairly stable, down 2% linked
quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the
year, and mortgage results softened a bit. Capital markets fees and service charges were stable.
We remain highly disciplined on expenses which are up 1% linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying
positive operating leverage of 6% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.9%. We
recorded a provision for credit losses of $123 million and a reserve build of $49 million this quarter, which reflects
an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.41%, up

from 1.37% at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day one CECL reserve of
approximately 1.3%.
Our tangible book value per share is down 8.6% linked quarter, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates on
AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 9.8%, just above the midpoint of
our target range.
Next, I'll provide further details related to third quarter results. On slide 6, net interest income was up 11% given
higher net interest margin and 2% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is 3.25%, up 21 basis
points. As you can see on the NIM walk in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, the healthy increase in asset
yields outpaced funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet.
Moving to slide 7. With the current expectation for the Fed to raise rates further, we are confident that we will
continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has
driven a significant improvement in NII year-to-date, and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth
quarter and compound into 2023. Our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately 3.3% at the end of the
third quarter, up from 2.6% for the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations.
Our asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside if the forward curve continues to move up.
We expect cumulative loan betas to exceed deposit betas through the rate cycle. Our interest-bearing deposit
beta is tracking well within our expectations, and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of Fed
rate hikes from here. So far this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 225 basis points since 4Q 2021, our cumulative
interest-bearing deposit data is well controlled at 18% through the end of the third quarter. On a sequential basis,
our deposit beta was 26%.
We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements to our
deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to
attract durable customer deposits. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable
and stable outlook for NII as we benefit from the higher-rate environment. You'll find the summary of our hedge
position in the Appendix on slide 23.
In the third quarter, we did an additional $10 billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through
2024 and beyond, primarily through forward starting swaps. We expect our NIM to rise to 3.5% or better by the
end of 2023, and for our overall hedge position to provide a NIM floor of about 3.25% through the fourth quarter of
2024, if we see rates come down by 200 basis points across the forward curve. The floor could move higher with
further hedge actions.
Moving on to slide 8. We posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher
rates. These were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter, as our client hedging business returned to more historical
levels following an exceptional first half of the year.
Card fees were strong again this quarter, while capital markets and service charges were stable. Focusing on
capital markets, market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets. M&A advisory fees picked up
nicely, but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market
volatility.
We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines, which continue to build the strong pitch activity and a
growing backlog. While current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close, capital markets fees

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in M&A advisory and even more broadly
as markets settle down.
Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes, which more than
offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter but still remain below historical levels. We
are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time, and servicing
operating fees were stable. Wealth fees are $5 million lower linked quarter, given the impact of lower market
levels on AUM. And in other income, we saw a seasonal benefit from our tax-advantaged investments and an
increase in leasing revenue.
On slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to
make good progress and is on track to deliver over $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year.
Average loans, on slide 10, were up 2% linked quarter, driven by 3% growth in commercial with growth in C&I and
CRE, given modestly higher line utilization and slower paydowns. Retail loans increased 1% with growth in
mortgage and home equity, offsetting planned run-off in auto. Period-end loans were broadly stable linked
quarter, given higher than usual end-of-quarter C&I line paydowns, which were generally redrawn after quarter-
end.
On slide 11, average deposits were up $1.3 billion, or 1% linked quarter, with growth coming from retail term
deposits from Citizens Access savings, and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable. Deposit costs
remain well controlled. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 38 basis points, which translate to an 18%
cumulative beta.
We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment and our performance to date is
reflective of the investments made to strengthen our deposit franchise since the IPO. Overall, liquidity improved
as we reduced our FHLB advances by $2.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter-end.
Moving on to slide 12. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios.
Net charge-offs were 19 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, but still very low relative to historical levels.
Non-performing loans were broadly stable at 55 basis points of total loans. Given the higher risk of recession, we
are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular CRE office, leverage loans and
selected nonprofit sectors. At this point, we aren't seeing significant issues emerge.
Also, the leading indicators for consumer continued to be stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels. Personal
disposable income has declined from stimulus-driven highs, but remains above the pre-pandemic 2019 average.
Spending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above pre-pandemic levels, while credit card and home
equity line utilization are still well below pre-pandemic levels. And retail delinquencies continue to remain
favorable to historical levels.
Turning to slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see very good credit
performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. While we aren't seeing stress in the portfolio at this point,
we increased our allowance by $49 million to take into account an increased risk of recession, partly offset by
improvement in portfolio mix. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.41%, which is a modest increase from the
second quarter.
If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. However, given the
Investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix, we estimate our pro forma day one CECL allowance to
6


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
be approximately 1.3%. The current reserve level contemplates the shallow recession and incorporates the risk of
added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation, supply chain issues, and
return to office trends.
Moving to slide 14, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, which is
slightly above the midpoint of our target range. This, combined with our strong earnings outlook, puts us in a
position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share and the tangible
common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI.
We have increased our held-to-maturity portfolio to about 30% of total loans at quarter-end, which has helped to
mitigate the impact of rising rates. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can
expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation.
Shifting gears a bit. On slides 15 and 16, you'll see some examples of the progress we've made against the key
strategic initiatives and what's on tap for our businesses in the near term. Since we closed the Investors
acquisition in April, we've been executing against a phased approach to the integration. In the second quarter, we
began originating mortgages on our systems; and since then, we have completed the conversion of mortgage
servicing.
We also successfully completed the conversion of more than 10,000 Investors' wealth clients, representing about
$1.6 billion in assets to our platform. We have a lot more to do, but I'm pleased to say that we are on track to
complete the deposit and branch conversions in mid-first quarter 2023.
We have included a high-level integration timeline in the Appendix on slide 22. Importantly, we remain on target to
achieve our planned $130 million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023, of which approximately
70% will be achieved by the end of 2022. We also continue to expect that the integration process will come in
below our initial estimates.
In the last few years, we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to
bank with us. Last week, we announced the next step in that evolution with CitizensPlus, which provides financial
rewards, banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized
wealth management. This includes Citizens Private Client, our new expanded wealth management offering, which
will launch by the end of the year.
We are fully committed to driving momentum at our wealth business. And as part of the launch, we are hiring
more than 200 new financial advisors and relationship managers. We continue to make meaningful strides
forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization. Earlier this year, we migrated Citizens Access to
a fully cloud-enabled platform and we launched a national storefront, adding mortgage and education refis to the
portal.
Over the next year or so, we plan to expand our national storefront, adding card and checking first, and then
wealth and Citizens Pay. As we add products to the platform, we have an exciting opportunity to build
relationships across a growing national customer base. Our vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this
modern platform over time, which will be a sea change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing
upgrades and enhancements.

We are also growing our innovative Citizens Pay offering which is currently at about 160 merchant partners and
expanding across targeted verticals. Over the next year, we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique
customer direct experience.
Moving to the commercial business on slide 16. Over the past eight years, we've invested heavily in talent and
product capabilities in M&A, corporate finance, bond and equity underwriting, FX and commodities, and so on.
Despite the challenging environment, we remained near the top of the lead tables, consistently ranking in the top
10 as a middle-market and sponsor book runner, and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access
capital through the public markets. We have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as
well with our coverage.
We are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisition, as we target growth in key verticals. The
JMP acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare, technology and financial services sectors,
expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities. And DH Capital expands our capabilities in the
Internet infrastructure, communications sectors, software and next-generation IT services. These businesses are
exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen.
Moving to slide 17, I'll walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be up roughly 3%, driven
by the benefit of higher rates, with the margin rising to the 3.3% to 3.35% range. Average loans are expected to
be stable to up modestly, as commercial growth is partially offset by auto rundown. Fees are expected to be
stable to up modestly. Non-interest expense is expected to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be
approximately 20 to 22 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of
9.5% to 10%. And our tax rate should come in at approximately 22%.
With respect to the full year, we continue to track well and expect to beat our full-year 2022 guidance across key
P&L categories and performance measures. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for full-year 2022 in
excess of 5% with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about 3%. We also expect to deliver a
full-year efficiency ratio of about 57% with the fourth quarter coming in under 54%, and we expect to deliver a full-
year ROTCE in excess of 16% with the fourth quarter well above both Q3 and our medium term target range of
14% to 16%.
To sum up, on slide 18, we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment and we are optimistic about
the outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net
interest income from the higher rate environment.
Our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business in particular is well positioned
for when markets stabilize, and our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark. We are well prepared
for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position. And we are being prudent
with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are playing some offense, executing
well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver medium-term growth and outperformance.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
[indiscernible] (00:23:45) could expand a little on your thoughts regarding NII dynamics into next year. I thought
the 350 year-end 2023 margin expectation, that was definitely a highlight. And I think, just generally, your
comments about loan betas, overwhelming deposit betas, sort of cumulatively, those suggests some confidence
that NII should continue to grow after the Fed stops tightening. But just would love to hear your thoughts on the
puts and takes, additional color you might be willing to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sure. So, I'll just break it down into two overall categories, you got the net interest margin dynamic, which is
a big driver. And we're messaging that we expect our net interest margin to continue to rise. I think loan betas in
the last cycle for us were up near 60% or so. This cycle, we're doing some more hedging, so you could see our
loan betas dropping a little bit.
The nice part about that is that it provides that downside protection. So, you're going to see loan betas in the mid
to – sort of low to mid-50s. You compare that to a deposit beta that we previously message would be around 35%
or so. Rates have been up 100 basis points since then. I mean, you can see our deposit betas maybe getting into
the upper 30s or thereabouts, given – cumulatively, given what's going on with rates in the last – in the recent
couple of months.
So, you take that dynamic and see cumulative loan betas and exceeding deposit betas and that drives NIMs
higher. We're also re-mixing on the loan side into more variable. You're seeing the strength of the multi-year
investments on the deposit side playing out. And then, let's not forget the other aspects of the balance sheet
where you've got securities book, and that securities book is funded primarily by DDA and some wholesale. And
so, you can see the front book/back book dynamics really taking hold where you got securities yields on the front
book in the fourth quarter somewhere between 4.50% and 5% and with a 2% run off. And so, that's pretty
9


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
powerful when you've got essentially a strong DDA underpinning what's going on there in the securities book. So,
those are some of the net interest margin dynamics.
If you flip over to the other side of things where you see our opportunity for continued loan growth, where you're
seeing us rotate into more of a variable rate approach, solid opportunities in home equity and other aspects in the
retail side, but commercial is – we're feeling optimistic on the commercial side and that's going to drive loan
growth into 2023. It'll be economic environment dependent and – but nevertheless, the underpinning of rising
NIMs, I think, is really what gives us the confidence to continue to see that NII improving into 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. That's perfect color. Thank you very much for that. And I guess just the – with rates having moved so
much, just curious about your thoughts on sort of the Citizens Access product, what kind of trends are you
observing about sort of the stickiness of those customers? How much is loyal? How much are sort of shopping for
rates? And are your tactics at all changing with regard to that product?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Brendan, why don't you take that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks. We've seen some decent growth in Citizens Access and the digital native customer still exists and
out there and is waking up a little bit as rates have gone up. So, we're – it's been a very, very effective strategy for
us. The customers are loyal to Citizens. We're seeing good augmentation from those customers, a very real brand
engaged customers and the customer base is growing. So, our balance growth is coming from both sides, new
customer acquisition and existing customers bringing us more as we brought rates up. But most importantly, it
serves to sort of – have an isolated deposit rates and strategy to protect the core bank from needing to bring in
rate-sensitive customers into the bank. We're really relationship-focused in our core franchise and the
combination of the health of our deposit franchise improvement led by DDA and primacy of our customers has
been really showing up well. So, our deposit betas in consumer are dramatically different than they were in the
last cycle.
And it's really for both of those points, the turnaround in the health of the customer franchise in the core bank, and
then the effective strategy of using Access hope to drive national growth, but also to have a much more targeted
and isolated way to grow interest-bearing deposits that doesn't make us reprice our whole book. So, we're really
pleased with how it's playing out. And Citizens Access is right where we thought it would be and it's being
executed really well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then, the strategic aspects of Citizens Access that over time is just a whole another benefit of that platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Correct. I think that's what obviously we've messaged that on these calls before. But the integration of our
Citizens Access deposit platform with all of our national lending businesses to make our national platform much
10

more integrated and customer strategic. John mentioned the launch of our new app and our cloud-based
migration. We are making really sizable progress on bringing together all of our national capabilities to deepen
those relationships, as well as just sort of the deposit angle that we launched with a couple of years back.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning and thank you so much for the crisp and impactful messaging from this morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is for you, Bruce. You have teased that your TOP 8 is underway. And as we think about how
much you've improved the bank, and John has certainly helped balance sheet, and Brendan and Don have
helped balance sheet positioning. What is your vision for what TOP 8 could accomplish? So, we're looking at a
bank clearly outperforming the market today, outperforming expectations, it feels like a lot of the big rates of
change have been accomplished in the previous seven plans. So, that's sort of the genesis of the question, what
do you envision TOP 8 to accomplish?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, well, Erika, I think when we ended up hitting TOP 2 and TOP 3, we were getting questions as to how much
re-architecture and re-engineering of how you're running the bank is left. Is the – are you now picking the fruit
that's really high in the tree? And yeah, it was getting higher in the tree. But I think what we've been able to do is
exhibit this mindset of continuous improvement that we're not going to be satisfied with how we're running the
bank, and we're going to look at all aspects in terms of how our staff and organized and our vendor relationships
and other kind of efficiency, new technology deployment to deliver more efficiencies. And so, over time, that's just
become part of our DNA here.
And so, we're not going to rest and say, well, we just had another successful result with TOP 7. Let's take a
breather. You really can't take a breather because we have investments that we want to fund in our future, the
business initiatives that we list on a couple of slides in consumer and commercial. And that requires net
investment in CapEx and OpEx. And in order to fund those things, having these TOP programs and finding
efficiencies to self-finance those investments and keep the overall rate of expense growth modest is the equation
11

that we've used to drive ROTCE from the 5% when we started at the IPO to 18% levels today. So, I think you're
going to continue to see us pursue that mindset of continuous improvement. And don't be surprised when we
have a successful announcement and execution of TOP 8 that there might be even more TOP programs down
the road after that.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just a few cleanup questions. Thank you so much for giving us a lot of color on the ACL. I'm wondering
what the weighted average unemployment rate that you assume in the 141 ACL today. And just, John, a quick
cleanup question to Scott's line of questioning. As we think about the NII dynamics into next year, what are you
assuming about deposit growth and deposit mix shift?

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just take the – the first one is we're using some fairly conservative assumptions when we set the ACL.
So, I would characterize it as a moderate recession rather than a short recession. And the unemployment levels
get up over 6% is kind of where we've modeled it. So, we think we're being fairly conservative, but we reassess
that each quarter. So, John, I'll hand the deposit question over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. And I think the – some of the trends that you'll likely see into the fourth quarter continue into 2023.
But I'd say, the couple of items I'd highlight are starting with the customer value proposition that you're seeing us
continue to invest in, it's been multi-years to build this deposit platform. And in both consumer and commercial,
those investments are coming to fruition and demonstrating themselves, but we're continuing to invest. So, you're
seeing just poor deposit growth coming from that. And you heard Brendan and us talk about CitizensPlus as an
example of the core growth that we think can give us some unique ability to take some share into 2023. Citizens
Access and the retail CD arena is a place where we have taken that down close to zero. And so, that will come
back a bit in that category.
Let's not forget New York Metro. We've entered New York Metro, and we're starting to see really nice uptake once
we converted HSBC. We're going to convert ISBC in the first quarter of 2023. So, we suspect that we're going to
start to see some lift coming out of that.
And then just broadly in commercial, the product and coverage investments that we've been making over the
years and continue to make will offset what we're building in. All of what I just described will offset. Our
expectation we're going to have some DDA migration as rates rise. So, that's built into our outlook and built into
the NIM guide that we're going to have some realistic expectations of the migration. So, those are some of the
areas I would highlight.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Some really good detail on credit back in the Appendix, page 24 for retail and 25 on commercial.
And obviously, you guys have improved the mix in both areas over the last few years. But are there any signs of
weakness within certain kind of customer groups that you could point to? And then, like what leading indicators
might you suggest that we watch and that you pay attention to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start, and then maybe turn it over to my colleagues for some additional color. But, Matt, I think what
continues to be very positive is that the expectation that things will normalize back to pre-COVID levels continues
to be deferred. And so, we're only seeing very slow migration in terms of consumer charge-offs and NPAs and
delinquencies. It's still kind of better than pre-pandemic period.
And I would highlight there that our focus on very high quality borrowers in these portfolios, super prime and high
prime, those folks are still doing pretty well through the current environment and have a lot of liquidity. And so, we
feel really good about where things sit in consumer.
Similarly in commercial, over time, we've migrated to lend to kind of bigger companies, so mid-corporate space
companies in excess of $500 million in revenues, and they tend to be more diversified and better credits. And so,
we also see very solid performance metrics across all the things, NPAs and charge-offs, etcetera. On that side,
you've got to go to the usual suspects, if you think the economy is weakening, and that would be commercial real
estate, leveraged lending, and then maybe certain sectors in nonprofit, which we've heightened our monitoring in
those areas, but we don't see any smoke at this point. So, maybe with that, let me turn it to Don for additional
color on commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think you hit it. We've actually activated our downturn playbook, which involves a lot of incremental stress
and a lot of incremental portfolio management, a lot of incremental conversations with clients. I think there's a
couple pieces of good news just supporting the lack of deterioration in credit. One is, we think management
teams, going through the pandemic, got incredibly focused on efficiency and their business, and they cut costs
and they automated, and they built liquidity, and they repaired balance sheets, and they hedged. And they did a
lot of things that were prudent from a risk standpoint. So, there's a little bit of a buffer, we think, in the portfolio
against what could be deterioration if we go into a deep recession.
I'd say the thing we're most focused on is the real estate office portfolio given back to work. We've got fully leased
office buildings and those leases are running for a couple of years in the future. But we've got lease rolls that
we're focused on and whether they're going to renew or not. I think just personally, I guess – I was in New York
City yesterday, people are back in the offices [indiscernible] (00:38:11)...

Yeah. Yeah. And then, a lot of it's suburban.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So, I would say it's in the right places. A lot of it's in places which are in the southern tier and things like that. So,
we don't have a lot of San Francisco, for example, where they're going to have – there's going to be a lot of
distress. So, MSAs are important in the real estate business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I think the leverage book is – you always look at the leverage – the sponsor leverage book. Our strategy
there, which is high levels of diversification, our average hold is kind of $10 million to $12 million. So, we do a lot
of leveraged finance, but we distribute 95% to 97% of it. And we're not really seeing any kind of severe stress in
the leverage book. So, we feel pretty good. And all the early stats, the quick class ratios, the non-performing
loans, the watched assets which we have very significant [ph] process (00:39:02) around, all seem to be in pretty
good shape right now, but we're not asleep.
The other thing I'll mention, and John touched on this, we are being incredibly disciplined on new originations.
We're really not taking on any new clients right now. We're getting very focused on returns. We're actually
commanding a higher level of pricing given the current market environment. So, we're watching the front book
very carefully also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. How about you, Brendan?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say that the health of the consumer is still very, very resilient. Having said that, we're doing a lot of the
similar things that Don is mentioning, kind of putting in a proactive approach to a potential downturn, so making
investments and collections, being ready for an inevitable tick in the wrong direction, tightening some credit on the
margins, we're being incredibly disciplined on where we're lending right now to make sure that the returns are
right and we've got deep, real customer relationships, and it's within the risk profile that is within our risk appetite.
Having said all of that, with what we're seeing kind of out the window today, the consumer is still 20% plus excess
liquidity in deposits as a general statement and charge-offs are still at 50% to 60% of the rates that they were pre-
14

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
COVID. And we're not seeing any meaningful signs of that reinflating. If you look at the overall US, the bottom
decile or two of the country, you're starting to see that excess deposits burned off, and they're living more
paycheck-to-paycheck, which is where they were pre-COVID. We don't over-index on that segment. And so, we
indexed much higher. And so, we're not seeing a lot of the pain that is potentially happening at the very bottom of
the segment in the US, flowing through anything in our book.
Look, we're seeing some very, very early signs that potentially were at the early days of a normalization. Credit
card customers that pay in full each month. That was about 32% of our portfolio pre-COVID. It's now at 41%. It
peaked at 42%. So, it's down a tiny bit, but it's still significantly better than what it was before COVID. So, we're
starting to see small signs of potentially customers getting to normal, but I wouldn't say it's accelerating at all. It's
still very resilient and significantly healthier than where it was pre-COVID.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just wanted to follow up, one, on credit. I think if I heard you correctly that your ACL assumes a 6%
unemployment rate. It just means, I think, CECL is still relatively new. I'm trying to understand, absent that
unemployment rate expectations going materially higher, just if you could give us the thought process around
drivers of additional reserve build over the coming quarters. Is it the CRE market? Is it home prices? Because
what I'm trying to get to is unemployment at 3.5%, 6% seems a long ways away. If that doesn't go much higher,
what else would drive those results materially higher relative to where we ended the quarter?

Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start there. I mean, I think that, first, I'd like to just make sure we're reminded. So, we've
got 141 basis points against the portfolio right now. When you pro forma adjust that for investors and some other
things, you get our day one of about 130. So, we're 11 basis points over day one. So, that covers a lot. And so,
we're covering the environment that Bruce described earlier. I think you can – and he also mentioned a few
pockets of areas that we're watching very closely. So, we're watching the CRE office space and we're watching a
few sectors on the C&I side, just reminding that we're not seeing any – when you look at where our delinquencies
are, we're not seeing any early signs of any deterioration here.
But that could change and that could change quickly. So, we're keeping a close eye on it. But – and as things
turn, we'll have those areas of concern that we were focused on in the pandemic which most of which got cleaned
out and has improved over time but those – that's the playbook we'll go back to. We'll go back to those areas of
concern and take it from there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add that I think we're feeling pretty good if you look at a scenario that says we get to a
moderate recession and it doesn't get any worse than the need to actually keep building may lessen from what it
was this quarter. I think there was a reassessment. But the Fed's going to have to stay at higher rates, which
probably increases the probability of recession a little bit. And that was reflected in going up the 4 basis points.
So, you'd have to see even greater convictions that we're likely to hit a recession or the Fed is going to go higher
with rates, which is going to have more collateral damage for the need to build on the macro outlook.
Of course, the other things that contribute to higher provision is loan growth. So, if we have loan growth and then I
think also, as John indicated, if we have a kind of changing view on certain sector risks. We already have
overlays, for example, for the things we mentioned. We have a kind of reserve built for commercial real estate
office. We think that's sufficient, but our view on that could change over time. So, I think we're kind of sitting at a
pretty good spot now.
We'll have to wait and see what happens with the macro forecast in certain sectors and the amount of loan growth
that comes through. Those things would determine whether we have to keep building the reserve and how much.
I would say that I think that the concerns that we're going to be building the way we did during the pandemic and,
oh, my gosh, these numbers can be kind of a runaway freight train. We don't see that at all at this point. So, I think
those peers are overblown. That's probably one of the reasons this cast a pall over bank stock valuations. But at
this point, we don't see that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's a good color. And just one question, Bruce, on the New York strategy. So, once you complete investors
integration first quarter next year, give us a sense of, like, should we expect – like, are you adding new bankers?
What are the capabilities you're adding to their franchise, just given how huge that market can be in terms of just
market share gains, not just for the next year but for the next few years here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. So, I'll start, and then maybe I'll ask Don and Brendan to talk about their businesses. But I think the
theory has been that we bring a thoughtful approach to how we bank these markets. We really understand
16

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
neighborhoods, we understand individuals, and we really tailor advise to situations to where somebody is on their
life journey, kind of where they reside, etcetera. And on the corporate side, we also want to be that thought
leadership position where we're the trusted advisor to a company as they negotiate aiding its many challenges
and trying to achieve growth. And we've been able to stake out that ground successfully in the major cities that we
compete in. We do it well in Boston. We do it well in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, some of our other big cities.
And so, notwithstanding the fact that New York is a relatively crowded and competitive marketplace, we think that
our style can be successful in New York. It's going to take a little time. We bought some good foundational assets.
We need to bring our additional kind of culture and approach and bring our broader product set, so we can do
more for customers and give them more advice and better capabilities, better customer experience. But we think
we'll be successful in that over time. So, in effect, this is a bet on ourself. And so far, everything is tracking exactly
the way we had expected with little signs of green shoots that we're kind of on to something pretty good.
With that, let me maybe go to Brendan first and talk about the consumer and the small business side and kind of
where you're making investments and sign of a view of the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We're incredibly pleased with the start in New York City post the HSBC acquisition. And as John mentioned
too, we've already started some integration with investors on mortgage and wealth in New Jersey and some of the
borrowers in New York. We're hiring. So, we're hiring up investment, financial advisors, mortgage loan officers,
and business bankers. We're also restocking the retail organization and infusing talent across the board. And so
far, it has really paid dividends. The New York market, and from a branch network standpoint, is the most
productive market out of any of our markets, so far, early days which is an incredibly good early sign. And we're
getting a lot of customers coming back to us from some of the big banks including HSBC customers that enjoyed
– that we didn't buy but enjoyed the location and the people, and we're really starting to see some growth.
Typically, when you do a branch deposit deal, you see some deposit runoff to the tune of 10% to 20% in the first
year. We're actually seeing the opposite. The underlying retail deposit base is actually net growing in New York
right away. And we didn't have any attrition post legal day one. So, there's a long way for us to continue to build
share that's early signed. But we're very bullish of what we're seeing so far. And in the Investors franchise, I'd say,
they kind of lead business banking more than consumer and we're excited about that. We think the Investors'
capabilities and their distribution can help us accelerate our business banking strategy overall across the
franchise.
And then, when we put our consumer playbook on the Investors franchise, we're seeing a big benefit already on
HSBC, and they were principally a retail franchise. When we put that on the Investors franchise, that didn't have a
meaningful retail presence. The difference from what we bought and what we can build over time is even more
substantial. So, we're very excited about it. There's still a lot to do, but early signs are very positive.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yeah. I would point at three things. One is the ability, as you said, goes to deliver a much broader product set into
the existing Investors franchise. So, great expanded Treasury services capabilities, for example, ability to hedge
directly for clients and that's well underway. And we will pick up a lot of very good bankers from the Investors side.
So, our workforce kind of quadruples overnight just with the acquisition.
Second thing is we're going to benefit on the commercial side from all the branding that Brendan is doing. So, the
visibility in New York City of branches at advertising and the like is the name recognition is helpful. So, we don't
have to explain who Citizens is to potential new clients, and we are we are also hiring. We announced yesterday
a new market Head for New York City Metro, which came from JPMorgan. So, we've got a new leader in place in
New York and we're off to the races.

thank you. John, talking about your hedges that you put into place. Slide 23 gives us a good breakout of what you
have in place. Can you show what those – obviously, it's protecting should rates start to go down, I would assume
in late 2023 and into 2024. What kind of rate environment would work against what you just put into place or what
you've had in place and you put more into place this quarter? What kind of rate outlook would that – this would not
really work that well with?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean. Well, let me just start off with I think that the point of getting those hedges on in the third quarter
was to allow ourselves to continue to participate in 2023 with rates rising. And so, that the intent of all of that was
to look past this next year into 2024 and 2025 and say if, in fact, we end up with a lower regime in those years,
let's try to find ourselves into a floor that would help maintain the level of ROTCEs that we're trying to achieve.
And so, we're stabilizing revenues and stabilizing our returns by doing this. Now, of course, there's a tradeoff.
That tradeoff is if rates, instead of beginning to come down in 2024, they were to remain high or go even higher,
that would be an opportunity cost. But nevertheless, on an absolute basis, we get very attractive returns being
locked in through this strategy. And I think that's really what we're trying to achieve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
That's – Gerard, it's tricky. You're trying to find a sweet spot and you're looking at the forward curve and talking to
economists, looking at economic forecasts and leaving yourself enough upside participation for high rates, but
then also recognizing that they're not going to stay up forever in trying to floor out your downside.
And so, time will tell. Hindsight is always 2020. If you went through earlier, you missed the window. If you had
held off another six months, could have gotten better levels. But right now, we feel we've done a pretty good job of
– as you can see from the results today, we're still asset sensitive. We're still benefiting as rates go up, and now
we can sleep at night that we're not going to see ROTCE slide down the pole if rates turn around and go back
down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And is it safe to assume all the counterparties or the major global investment banks in these hedges?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then, just the second follow-up question, obviously you're not an advanced approach
bank, and therefore the AOCI is not an issue with your CET1 ratio, which is the binding constraint for most banks
or all banks. When do you think people start to get a little concerned about the tangible common equity ratio?
19


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yours is still very healthy. But is there – I know it's an accounting issue. We all get that. But do you think it will be
a concern if it gets too low and do you have any idea what that rate might be?
And then second, John, when you accrete the AOCI back into capital as the bonds pay off, do you know about
how much will start coming in starting maybe next year in terms of the AOCI and coming back into capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe I'll just start to say that we did put the TCE to TA ratio into our presentation deck today, because we
do think it's worth keeping an eye on that. And some folks in the peer group either have bigger securities portfolio
or didn't put as much in HTM, and the TCE to TA ratio sliding quite a bit. Ours is sliding a little bit, but still appears
pretty healthy. You could argue that if that's not a regulatory ratio, it's not really something to worry about
significantly, because it will turn around over time. It's just effectively you've got these securities that are going to
be earning you less than if you were able to take the cash and reinvest at today's levels.
So, anyway, I think we feel good we're above 6%. In historical times, it's kind of been a marker, and I think we can
sustain it there. We have about 30% of the overall portfolio in held to maturity, and we'll have to see where rates
go. But if they go up a little bit from here, we're going to continue to generate capital. We think we can keep it at
pretty healthy levels.
John, I'll turn it over for you for kind of the turnaround and the rest of the answer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, great. And just to supplement the earlier one, I mean, we've got – our held-to-maturity is around 30% right
now and sort of balances that a little bit from – to that point as well. As it relates to how the AOCI will come back
in if rates kind of move around on us, just the way to think about it, at September 30, we have about $4.5 billion
after tax sitting in that number, and that will come in over about five years. So, that gives you an ability to work
through that, hopefully, Gerard.

Yeah. Sure. So, we are kind of at the north end of our 9.5% to 10% range, and we indicated we would expect to
land there at the end of the year. So, I think if you look at our target range relative to peers, we've been a little on
the conservative side, which I think has served us well, and particularly going into an environment with a
significant amount of uncertainty, that's the position we want to be in.
Having said that, you can see the level of profitability we have now is very significant. So, we're generating a huge
amount of tangible equity each quarter, this quarter, next quarter. And so, we could certainly blow past 10% if we
weren't back in the market buying our stock. So, I think there's opportunity for us to even improve that ratio a little
further and be in the market buying our stock.
The wildcard often is the amount of balance sheet growth and the amount of – are there any acquisitions likely in
the near term. And I think on that score, we've given you the guidance for what we see for loan growth. So, that's
factored in. And then, I'd say on the acquisitions, we've really only done very small acquisitions so far this year.
We've really been 100% focused on making sure we're integrating the ones we did last year. We had a pretty
banner year last year with the New York Metro play, and then JMP and DH Capital. And so, we focus on
integrating. We feel really good about where those are. And so, nothing big likely before the end of the year even
just in terms of the fee-based deals that we do. So, I think we have the wherewithal to go out and build the ratio a
bit further, plus get in the market and buy back some stock.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. I know we're getting over an hour or so. Just a quick one, follow-up on Gerard's question. So, how
through the hedging program do you feel like you are at this point, given what you show us on that slide 23? Have
you kind of done what you need to do? If not, how much more might you think you need to still add to get that
asset sensitivity to the position you really wanted to live in? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think, this – well, there are many things that we consider when we work through this. We think
about the evolution of the balance sheet, where we think rates are going to go, etcetera. But if you look at our
3.3%, most of that's on the short end. If you were to say, okay, we know that the Fed is not going to raise rates
anymore and you wanted to take that down to neutral, that would mean about $10 billion or $15 billion of
additional hedging that would be necessary.

And so – but we're going to be careful and methodical about that and update our balance sheet outlook, update
our asset sensitivity. But there's still a significant amount of hedging left to do before we would say that we're
done with this cycle.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just a quick follow. So, John, that point you made in the deck about 4Q 2024 NIM floor of 3.25%
and a down 200 basis points. If the Fed does hang high, do you have an idea what that NIM looks like in a down
100 basis points scenario?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, it's somewhere between the two, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I mean I think somewhere between the two. I mean I'd say that that would be a better outcome for us and you
could expect that that will be somewhere between the two, the 3.25% bps and 3.50% book ends that we did.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's fair. All right. Just want to make sure that was – it was pretty symmetric. Thank you.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On the capital markets side of business, I know you indicated the expected seasonal increase in the fourth
quarter. Could you help us size that up? How you think about the magnitude there based upon your pipeline?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
John, we had a little trouble hearing you.
[indiscernible] (01:01:54).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So, John, we've got pipelines bigger than we've ever had on our capital markets side. I think it's important to kind
of realize that the place we play is middle market and capital markets. So, the most troubled spots to generate
revenue in capital markets is these very large M&A deals which require very large financing. So, those are where
we're struggling with the markets.
So, we were really pleased that we were able to hold cap markets kind of flat quarter-on-quarter, given all the
volatility in the market. And we think most of the action is going to come in M&A. We've got a very big M&A
pipeline, a lot of which does not require financing and it looks like it's moving along quite nicely. So, it's not going
to double, but we think it could go up $10 million or $20 million in the fourth quarter. But we'll just have to see as
we go through the quarter how much volatility and what the backdrop is. But we're assuming pretty big discounts
to the pipeline in terms of what we're forecasting right now. So, we're pretty comfortable that we're going to have a
good quarter.
And then, we do think we'll get a – we'll do a little better now that the currency and interest rate volatility has come
down a little bit. That hurt us in the third quarter because people weren't really willing to step into the market and
hedge. We think we'll do a little bit better on the market business also in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would just add, so we don't get carried away with Don's sanguine outlook on commercial fees in Q4. When
we looked at our total fees at top of the house, we'll probably still see a little leakage on mortgage production. The
good news here is that servicing has held up very strong and so our diversification has paid and can lend stability
to mortgage. But there's probably a slight additional step to take in Q4. And then, we did make some changes in
our policies regarding overdrafts where we've done away with NSF fees. And so, that would clip the service
charges line a little bit. So, you'd probably see some strength in commercial offset a bit with a little fall in the
consumer side. But overall, we're guiding to the net of that should still be stable to up modestly. And we'll just
have to see how much of the capital markets pipeline, as Don said, actually gets printed.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. Hopefully you can hear me a little bit better. One last question, the – have you sized up the
size of the shared national credit portfolio? And then, also, what percentage of that portfolio are you in the lead
position?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think the shared national credit portfolio is a pretty decent size as we've moved up market. But I'd point
out a couple things there is that kind of when you're in shared national credits in general, those are bigger
companies that have multi-bank facilities and they tend to be better credits.
The second thing is that we continue to migrate towards trying to aim for the left lead position in those shared
national credits and/or be one of the book runners or admin agents, so become a meaningful bank to those
overall customers. And so, that's just been part of our strategy and we're making good traction on that strategy.
I think a lot of times investors will think that the shared national credits is a particular point of risk. Our view is that
actually it's just part of a strategy and those are actually good credits. And if you're getting to be in the driver's
seat of leading the deals, then that's the place you want to be. John, I think...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think that's right, and it's all about return against asset – against deployment. So, underlying the VSO strategy on
the commercial side that we've talked about in the quarter is we're exiting $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter of
under-returning assets. A lot of those are shared national credits, which just haven't panned out once we've been
a relationship for a couple of years. So, that portfolio churns quite aggressively also. And our ability to monetize
through the products' capabilities that we've built over the last five years is significantly different than it was five
years ago. We just have many, many more opportunities to engage and become that lead bank with those clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
That helps a lot. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Sure. I think that's the end of the queue on the questions. So, really appreciate everybody's interest and
support. Have a great day.
