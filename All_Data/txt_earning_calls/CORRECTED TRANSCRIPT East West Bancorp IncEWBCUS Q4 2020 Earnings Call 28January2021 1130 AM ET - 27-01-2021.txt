Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our full-year and fourth quarter
2020 earnings call. I will begin the review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation.
This morning, we reported full-year 2020 net income of $568 million or $3.97 per share. We returned 1.16% on
asset and 11.2% on equity for the year. Thanks to the unflagging commitment of our associates we are
successfully navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis and also the low interest rate
environment. The fourth quarter was a strong end to the year and result in net income of $164 million or $1.15 per
share, increased by three quarter â€“ by 3% quarter-over-quarter. Fourth quarter return on asset was 1.24% and
return on equity was 12.45%.
In Q4, we earned $251 million of pre-tax pre-provision income on total revenue of $416 million. Quarter-over-
quarter, our revenue grew by 10%, reflecting loan growth and higher fee income. Our pre-tax pre-provision
income grew by 12% and our pre-tax pre-provision profitability ratio expanded by 12 basis points to 1.9% in the
fourth quarter, up from 1.78% in the third quarter. Importantly, we saw across the board improvement in our asset
quality metrics, such as declining deferral and delinquency rates, lower net charge off and decreasing non-
performing and criticized assets. The macroeconomic outlook for post-pandemic recovery has been steadily
improving. And as we begin 2021, we are optimistic about the year ahead.
And now moving to slide 4 for a summary review of our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, total loans
reached a record high of $38.4 billion, growing by [ph] 10% (00:04:45) annualized from September 30 and by
10% year-over-year from December 31, 2019.
Paycheck Protection Programs, PPP loans total $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of $204 million
from September 30 due to forgiveness of loans by the SBA. We are participating in the current round of PPP to
support our customers and communities. And as of yesterday, we funded over 2,600 new PPP loans totaling over
$380 million.
Excluding PPP, total loans grew by $1.16 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflects growth in all of our major loan
portfolios. Fourth quarter loan production was broad-based and came from across our various lending teams and
branch network diversified by loan product, industry, geography and property type. We think that this lays a strong
foundation for the coming years.
Deposit growth was exceptionally strong in 2020. As of December 31, total deposits reached a record-high of
$44.9 billion, growing by 30% annualized from September 30 and by 20% year-over-year. In particular, non-
interest-bearing deposit reached a record $16.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Throughout 2020, growth in

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
non-interest-bearing deposit balances outpaced total deposit growth. Non-interest-bearing demand deposit made
up 36% of total deposit as of December 31, 2020, up from 30% a year ago.
Similar to loan growth, deposit growth was well-diversified across our commercial teams and branch network
including cross-border clients, reflecting the addition of new customers and expanding wallet share of existing
relationships. We look forward to the strong momentum in core deposit growth carrying into the coming year.
Turning to slide 5. You can see that we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7% and a total
capital ratio of 14.3%, providing us with meaningful capacity for growth to support our customers. Our book value
and tangible equity per share were both up 3% from the prior quarter and our tangible equity to tangible asset
ratios remain at 9.3% as of December 31, 2020, compared with September 30. Year-to-date, we increased
tangible equity per share by 9%.
Given our strong capital ratios and positive earnings growth and trajectory, I'm pleased to announce that East
West board of directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly common stock dividend from $27.5 per share to
$0.33 per share equivalent to an annual dividend of a $1.32. The new dividend will take effect beginning in the
first quarter and is payable on February 23, 2021 to stockholders of record on February 9, 2021.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding excluding PPP were
$12.1 billion as of December 31 and total C&I commitments were $17.1 billion. Quarter-over-quarter, C&I loans
outstanding ex-PPP grew by 18% annualized. Fourth quarter C&I growth built on the positive momentum in
pipelines and commitments that began in the third quarter. In 2021, we expect C&I growth to be stronger in the
second half of the year compared with first half. As the anticipated post-pandemic economic recovery takes hold.
Fourth quarter C&I growth was well diversified by industry with notable commitments, growth in general
manufacturing and wholesale, private equity, entertainment, food related industries, and clean energy. Further
diversifying our C&I growth was growth from our Greater China portfolio which was $1.5 billion as of December
31. In the fourth quarter, loans in the Greater China grew by $160 million, accelerating from growth of $82 million
in the third quarter. The utilization rate of loans outstanding to total commitments was 70.5% as of December 31,
2020, essentially unchanged from September 30.
Moving to slide 7 and 8 which shows essential details of our commercial real estate portfolio. Total commercial
real estate loans were $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Quarter-over-quarter, this portfolio grew by 4%
annualized from September 30. Presently, this is a slower growing performance, reflecting our conservative
underwriting in the current environment and the lower level of transactions in the market both for new deals and
for refinancing. We expect to see relatively slower growth from commercial real estate in 2021 until the anticipated
post-pandemic economic recovery gains momentum.
On slides 9 and 10, we provide details regarding our single-family residential loans and home equity lines. During
the fourth quarter, we originated $1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans, an increase of 38% compared with
$768 million in the third quarter. This was a record quarter of residential mortgage origination for East West, and
we are seeing the momentum continue in January.
As of December 31, single-family residential loans were $8.2 billion, up by 20% annualized from September 30.
Home equity lines outstanding were $1.6 billion as of December 31, up by 23% annualized from September 30
including unfunded commitments [ph] total commitment (00:11:53) on home equity lines were $3.4 billion at
December 31 and the utilization rate was unchanged quarter-over-quarter at 48%.

I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.
Irene?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start by discussing loans on COVID-related deferral on slide 11. As of December 31,
2020, loans on full payment deferral were 1.2% of total loans, down from 2.7% as of September 30. Including
loans on partial payment deferral which [ph] generally are (00:12:35) modifications of P&I payment to interest
only, deferred loans totaled $2.6 million of total loans, down from 4.2% as of September 30. Quarter-over-quarter,
loans on COVID-related deferrals decreased by 36% between September 30 and December 31, the largest
improvement was in our commercial real estate loan deferrals which decreased by $451 million or 39% since
September 30.
As of December 31, the deferral rate on CRE was down to under 5%. Deferrals on residential mortgages
decreased by 35% in fourth quarter and the deferral rate on residential mortgages was 2.5%. The deferral rate on
C&I loans continue to be very low.
Turning to slide 12 for a review of our asset quality metrics and slide 13 for a review of our allowance for loan
losses. Along with the decline in COVID-19-related deferrals, we're very pleased with the across the board
improvement in our asset quality metrics this quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, our criticized and non-performing
assets declined and related asset quality ratios improved. The outlook for an economic recovery continues to
strengthen. Our borrowers have proven to be resilient and adaptable.
We feel comfortable with the credit risk in our portfolio and believe that credit costs in 2021 will be manageable.
Non-performing assets were 45 basis points of total assets as of December 31 in the amount of $235 million, a
quarter-over-quarter decrease of 10%. Accruing loans, 30 to 89 days past due were $51 million or 13 basis points
of total loans as of December 31, a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 40%.
Criticized loans were $1.2 billion as of December 31 or 3.2% of total loans, a quarter-over-quarter decrease of
18% from $1.5 billion as of September 30 or 3.9% of total loans. Within that, both classified and special
mentioned loans declined quarter-over-quarter and their respective ratios improved. As of December 31, 2020,
classified loans decreased to 1.7% of total loans and special mentioned loans decreased to 1.5% of total loans.
Criticized C&I loans were diversified by industry and the criticized commercial real estate loans were likewise
diversified by property type. The largest concentration within criticized loans either industry or property type
remains oil and gas. Quarter-over-quarter, criticized CRE loans decreased by 19% and criticized C&I loans
excluding oil and gas decreased by 18%.
Criticized oil and gas loans were $324 million as of December 31, a quarter-over-quarter decrease of $74 million
or 19%. Reduction in these loans came from exits, paydowns, and upgrades. Oil and gas loan charge-offs were
under $1 million in the fourth quarter. The backdrop for the oil and gas borrowers has strengthened with higher
commodity pricing and demand.
On slide 13, we review there were components of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses
totaled $620 million as of December 31 or 1.68% of loans held for investment excluding PPP loans, compared
with $618 million or 1.73% as of September 30 and compared with $483 million or 1.39% on day one post-CECL.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Year-to-date 2020 post-day one of CECL, we added $137 million to the allowance, largely due to the deterioration
in the economic forecast due to COVID. However, the economic forecasts have improved in the second half of
2020, resulting in modest declines in the required allowance coverage for all of our major loan portfolio
classifications. If the macroeconomic conditions continue to improve and credit quality holds or improves, we
expect to see continued reduction in the required allowance ratio.
During the fourth quarter, we reported $24 million in provision for loan losses, compared to $10 million in the third
quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the provision was primarily due to fourth quarter loan growth of over
$1 billion, excluding PPP loans. The other [ph] loan charge-offs (00:17:18) including the improved macroeconomic
forecast, lower deferral rates on commercial real estate and reductions and adversely graded delinquent and non-
performing assets, lower oil and gas exposure and certain charge-offs largely offset each other.
Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were $19 million, a decrease of 22% from $24 million in the third quarter. The
fourth quarter net charge off ratio was 20 basis points of average loans annualized, an improvement of 6 basis
points from the third quarter, a quarter-over-quarter increase in commercial real estate charge offs in the fourth
quarter was more than offset by the quarter-over-quarter decrease in C&I charge offs. Fourth quarter charge offs
from oil and gas loans totaled under $1 million.
And now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide 14. In this slide, we summarize the key line
items of income statement which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. Fourth quarter 2020 included
some non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2019 write-off of DC Solar tax credit investment, which added $3
million or $0.02 per share to earnings.
Fourth quarter amortization of tax credit and other investments included $11 million of recoveries related to DC
Solar and fourth quarter income tax was elevated by $8 million of tax expense related to DC Solar. Largely as a
result of DC Solar related items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23% compared with 19% in the
third quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate for the full year, 2020 was 17% compared to 20% for 2019.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slide 15 through 18 starting
with average balance sheet growth. Fourth quarter average loan growth of â€“ fourth quarter average loan of $37.7
billion grew by $565 million or 6% linked quarter annualized led by growth in residential mortgage followed by C&I
loans excluding PPP and commercial real estate. Fourth quarter average deposit of $44.4 billion grew by $3.2
billion or 31% linked quarter annualized driven by very strong growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits
which grew at a rate equivalent to 56% annualized.
All other deposit categories excluding CDs [ph] have also grown (00:19:44). With the strong deposit growth, we
ended the year with an average loan to deposit ratio of 85%. Average available for sale debt securities increased
by almost $1 billion from the third quarter, as we deployed some of our cash. Late in the quarter, we also added
$250 million to repo assets, which did not yet show up in average balances.
We continue to deploy excess liquidity into AFS securities. But given the low interest rates and the flat yield curve,
attractive opportunities are limited. In October of 2020, we realized our excess liquidity to pay off in full the
PPPLF, which was $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2020. In the second quarter of 2021, we have $400 million of
FHLB advances maturing at a rate of 2.25%.
On slide 16, you can see that fourth quarter 2020 net interest income of $347 million increased by $27 million or
7% linked-quarter and the net interest margin of 2.77% expanded by 5 basis points from the prior quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans and the PPPLF, fourth quarter adjusted net interest income of $333 million

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
increased by 5% or $5 million quarter-over-quarter. And fourth quarter adjusted NIM of 2.76% [ph] compressed
(00:21:13) by 1 basis point from the third quarter.
PPP loans interest and deferred fee income was $14 million in the fourth quarter, up from $8 million in the third
quarter. In the third quarter, we adjusted the deferred fee income to account for the slower than anticipated
forgiveness and pay off of these loans. As of December 31, we have $13 million of deferred fees on last year's
PPP loans left to accrete in 2021, plus of course the interest income of 1% on the PPP loans outstanding.
Dominic shared the month-to-date funding of new PPP loans earlier on the call.
Based on that and applications and process, we expect to fund approximately $650 million of new PPP loans in
2021, generating approximately $28 million of [ph] growth PPP yield and (00:22:10) plus interest. The 5 basis
point quarter-over-quarter increase in the fourth quarter GAAP NIM breaks down as follows: up 6 basis points
from a lower cost of deposits; a 5 basis points for [ph] lower (00:22:23) PPP income; up 1 basis point from
repayment of the PPPLF partially offset by down 6 basis points from excess liquidity, in the form of more lower-
yielding assets and also down 1 basis points from lower loan and other earning asset yields.
Turning to slide 17. Fourth quarter average loan yields of 3.68% expanded by 8 basis points from last quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP, the fourth quarter adjusted loan yield of 3.69% contracted by 1 basis point quarter-
over-quarter exhibiting relative stability. [ph] The down in the (00:23:00) pricing of our variable rate loan portfolio is
behind us. In the upper-right quadrant, we laid out our average loan yield by portfolio. As you can see, our single
family residential mortgage product is the least rate sensitive portfolio and continues to carry attractive yield.
Turning to slide 18. Our cost of deposits continue to decline in the fourth quarter as maturing higher-rate CDs re-
price to current market rates. We expect to continue to reduce our cost of deposits as time deposits mature in the
first quarter of 2020 re-price lower. Our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter dropped to 25 basis points,
down from 33 basis points in the third quarter, an improvement of 8 basis points. The spot rate of total deposits as
of December 31 was 22 basis points. Month-to-date in January, the spot rate is down another [ph] 2 basis points
(00:23:55) to 20 basis points.
Our fourth quarter average costs of interest-bearing deposits dropped to 40 basis points, down from 50 basis
points in the third quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points. The spot rate of interest-bearing deposits as of
December 31 was 35 basis points. Month-to-date in January, the spot rate is down another 3 basis points to 32
basis points. The average cost of CDs in the fourth quarter was 74 basis points. We have $1.3 billion CDs
maturing in the first quarter at a blended rate of 1.22%.
The rate paid on originations or renewals of domestic CDs in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25 basis points
compared to 43 basis points in the third quarter. Month-to-date in January, this rate ticked down to 22 basis
points.
Moving on to fee income on slide 19. Total non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $70 million compared
with $54.5 million in the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by a number of factors
including a favorable change in the credit valuation adjustment of interest rate contracts, an increase in customer-
driven foreign exchange transactions and an increase in net gains on sale of SBA loans. Further, treasury
management fees continued to grow nicely as we grow commercial deposit accounts and transactions.
Moving on to slide 20. Fourth quarter non-interest expense was $179 million, an increase of 4% linked quarter.
Excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit and tangible amortization adjusted
non-interest expense was $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 7% quarter-over-quarter and
7

exceptionally flat year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter change in operating expenses was primarily driven by
increased bonus compensation approval and increased OREO expense which was included in other operating
expense.
The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 39.8%, an improvement from 40.8% in the third quarter. Over the
past five quarters, our efficiency ratio has ranged from 38.3% to 40.8%, despite operating headwinds from the
COVID pandemic, related economic slowdown and near-zero interest rates.
And with that, I'll now review our outlook for 2021 on slide 21. For the full-year 2021, we currently expect year-
over-year loan growth excluding PPP of 6% to 8%. For context, loan growth excluding PPP was 6% in 2020 and
7.5% annualized for the second half of 2020. We expect well-diversified growth in 2021 coming from all of our
major loan portfolios. The diversification of our loan portfolio in terms of loan type, industry, real estate property
and geography allows us to outperform our peers in terms of loan growth year-in, year-out.
Year-over-year adjusted net interest income growth excluding PPP is generally in line with loan growth on a full-
year basis. Underpinning our interest rate, interest income assumptions is the current forward interest rate curve.
Adjusted non-interest expense growth excluding tax credit and investment amortization of 3% to 5% year-over-
year. In the current environment, we are focused on net interest income and pre-tax, pre-provision income growth.
Provision for credit losses to range between $70 million and $80 million with the loan growth that we expect much
further improvement in the economic forecast, this provision outlook anticipates that the allowance coverage of
loans will continue to modestly reduce from current levels.
Full year 2021, effective tax rate of approximately 15% including the impact of tax credit investments. There will
be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credits investments placed into service.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Dominic Ng
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene. In summary, we had a strong finish to a most unprecedented year. It has been a challenging
year for many, and I wish to thank all of our associates for their commitment and dedication to meeting our
customers' banking needs. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are optimistic about the year ahead
including the expected additional government stimulus to rebuild businesses and communities, enhanced support
for public health, and the broader distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.
In addition, we're looking forward to an improvement in the discourse between the US and China which will be
constructive for cross-border capital flows, and accordingly, for our clients business opportunities. We have strong
capital and liquidity to support balance sheet growth as the economy recovers. And we are confident that we will
be able to deliver another year of strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2021.
I would now open up the call to questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, just first question on credit. There are two things you can address, I guess, Irene. One, talk to us about
the remaining deferrals both, the partial and the full deferrals. When is the sunset for these? When do they come
to an end? And separately, if you could address your outlook on net charge-offs, as I think about what you talked
about reserve â€“ potential for sort of reserve release relative to your provisioning guidance, so [ph] if you could
(00:30:45) address those two.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. On the deferrals, I think we talked about before earlier in 2020, most of the deferrals, P&I or just the
principal were for three months period. I would say that the ones that we had that were [ph] outstanding
(00:31:03) at year-end, some of them giving just the nature and the process of deferrals every three months are a
little bit longer term. But on average, I would say still two to six months is what those deferral terms are. On the
charge-off ratios and our expectation for 2021, I want to just start by saying if you look at the full year or the fourth
quarter for 2020, the charge-off ratios were very low annualized for the fourth quarter 20 basis points full year of
2017. So at this point in time, I think it's realistic to think that it may increase a little bit from these levels. But as
we look at credit quality as it stands today, there is nothing that we're really concerned that the charge-off ratios
will increase dramatically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And just on a separate note maybe, Dominic. When you think about the C&I loan growth for the year, do
you see there's more potential for upside surprise or downside risk to your outlook? And just talk to us about any
new opportunity that you see on the C&I lending front that could be a meaningful growth driver for the bank.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we're always working on an upside surprise. But that being said, I think that we pretty much look at this year.
Now, the fourth quarter is exceptional 18% annualized growth, is really accumulation of efforts from the third and
9

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
the fourth quarter. And we kind of like somewhat highlight in the third quarter that we were developing as much
stronger pipeline. So, although [ph] those loans are getting (00:33:00) booked in the fourth quarter, so that was
exceptional. But if we look at the second half of 2020, sort of like annualized growth was about 7% for C&I. So
we're kind of using that as our current run rate.
And we feel pretty good about where we are today because we were able to grow in a very diversified direction
from industry types, product mix, and geographic regions, including even the Greater China region as I mentioned
earlier in my remarks that Greater China â€“ obvious, the Chinese economy is â€“ recover ahead of United States.
And so, we saw positive C&I loan growth in Hong Kong and China. In the third quarter, 6.5% annualized growth or
C&I loan growth in Greater China in third quarter, and then accelerate in the fourth quarter to 12% annualized
growth.
So we see that all has â€“ so good signs. And then, if we looked at so far domestically, from private equity, general
wholesale, manufacturing, entertainment, clean energy, all of these different areas were growing. So, from that
standpoint, overall, right now, we expect them to continue to do well. And so, hopefully, we'll do better than what
we forecast.
But in terms of downside, I guess the downside will be in case, I don't know, if there is a â€“ the vaccine distribution
not working well and somehow the execution from the government [ph] in towards the (00:34:56) stimulus plan
was not working and so forth and that can potentially sort of like derail some of the customers' confidence to
invest or to grow the business. That can potentially happen. But I looked at the current administration. It looks like
we have all very seasoned veterans that are managing the best they can. I have, I think, a higher confidence at
this point that there's higher likelihood that they will be able to get the economy turned around in the second half
of the year.

Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. My first question, just in terms of your NII guidance that is going to generally be in line with loan
growth, your loan growth comments that you said, obviously that loan growth picks up in the back half of the year,
should we expect the NII to follow that same trend like that it stays relatively flat in first half and then accelerates
in back half for an average of, let's call it, 6% to 8%? Would love any commentary. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Ken, so our guidance is end-of-period loan growth of 6% to 8%. So with the NII obviously following the average
loan growth for the year, I think, in general probably when you will get that maybe on the lower end of that 6% to
8% and probably what makes sense from that calculation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q

Got it. Understood. Okay. Yeah, I was thinking actually end of period. That totally makes sense. And then, just
separate question in terms of your CECL day one reserve, I think it was about 135 basis points, but I could be
wrong. Is that still a good target post-pandemic of where you might want to be given your current loan mix?

Yeah. Certainly, as you know, it's very complex calculation. So I can't comment on necessarily where I think it's
going to end up. But I would confidently say as economy recovers, as a credit quality continues to improve that I
believe there's certainly room to lower that allowance from the levels we are today.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question, and pre-emptive congratulations on the Year of the Ox. I hope it's better than
the year of the Rat. Wanted to ask [ph] just literally (00:37:46) on the charge-off this quarter and maybe what you
see coming through the pipe. I know generally you guys went to very low loan to value on commercial real estate.
So kind of just curious what's causing the actual charge-offs in those buckets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So the charge-offs for CRE in the quarter, we obviously especially with the pandemic and the environment,
there are some loans that we're working through. So these have been kind of problem non-performing loans for a
while. And depending on kind of looking at where the cash flows are and valuations and year-end kind of making
sure that the books are in order, [ph] took the (00:38:27) charge-offs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. So they're burning through kind of 30% to 50% equity cushions at resolution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think for these specific loans that are problematic, certainly the circumstances are unique, which is
why â€“ which is what you're referring to right generally for our borrowers. And the loan to value is being so low,
there's a lot of equity. But there are specific situations related to really cash flow which is why we took the charge-
offs.

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I do want to add that overall from a commercial real estate portfolio of multi-family, office building, hotels, retail,
shopping centers, and then all industrial buildings, you name it, all of that, I mean, as of today, we have a pretty

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
strong portfolio based on, not only just the LTV, but many of our customers, despite the pandemic, are still getting
by quite well. So, in fact, that's why you see the classified and criticized assets ratio coming down and deferral
coming down. And surprisingly, we always expect that these customers should do well, should do better as an
average compared with industry as a whole because of the low loan to value and then also many of them have
personal guarantee and they have a lot of liquidity. But I think the pandemic was a very good stress test to see
how overall, most of these customers have done well. I mean, obviously, we always have a few isolated incidents
here and there and that's what happened.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up on the residential lending, which seems like might be a larger portion of the
growth this year. What rate of provision do you put on that, and should we expect then kind of a lower growth rate
of fee income as a result of that higher mix of resi loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. For East West and the residential lending portfolio that we have in this product, some variation of it that
we've been originating for 40 years. The credit quality generally has been outstanding. In general, the reserve that
we have for our single-family and also the HELOCs, which I might add, are largely [ph] firstly HELOCs (00:41:11)
is quite low relative to the allowance that we bought for the rest of the portfolio. And in fact, with improvements in
the [ph] four past â€“ during (00:41:22) the fourth quarter, we've reduced the kind of required reserve from about 30
basis points down to 20 basis points. Overall, as I mentioned with the data that we have, the historic losses over
the course of 10, 20 years, it's been incredibly low for this portfolio.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
On your NII guide, I was just wondering what your thoughts were on adjusted NIM that you're expecting in that?
And given those strong securities growth in the quarter [indiscernible] (00:42:15) your assumptions for that growth
and deposit growth, which all will ultimately impact earning asset growth and NII as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, I think your question is really maybe the most unknown thing for US banks right now as far as the liquidity
and the deposit growth that most banks are continuing to experience. I think, for us, when we look at the growth of
NIM, NII, we're very comfortable that we'll be able to expand from the fourth quarter levels, not year-over-year, but
certainly from the fourth quarter levels and that we'll be able to maybe just kind of continue to expand throughout
2021.
I'll also add maybe one of the key drivers of why we're comfortable, although on the asset side, there's some
challenges, largely asset size, things have re-priced, securities. Now, I'll share like for example, the securities that
we're buying in January are probably yielding about 1.7% or so. We have extended out the duration a little bit, but
not extensively. And then, what we have there where we're more comfortable is, we do have a lot of deposits yet
and the funding that we expect to re-price over the course of the coming months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. Great. And just one follow-up on capital, you got plenty of excess capital and the buyback is still
outstanding. You haven't done anything with it since early last year. I was just wondering what you guys are
waiting for at this point. It looks like you've had some good improvement on the credit side, regulators seem to be
warming to it a little bit with the DFAS banks announcing buybacks for this quarter. So, just want to get your
updated thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. You are right. We still â€“ currently have a buyback authorization outstanding of $354 million remains. At this
point, we do not anticipate doing any buyback in the near future because, frankly, we look at where we are right
now. We're excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us. And frankly, we prefer to have capital available to
take advantage of any emerging opportunities that may come.
And as of today, when we looked at where we are from a return perspective, currently, we are generating
attractive return of equity, and we actually think we can hopefully do even better going forward. So, from that point
of view, it's not something that we lack of return that we need buy back to push [ph] unimpaired (00:45:05) shares
and stuff like that. Our position is that, from my experience for many years at East West Bank, we always done
best whenever there's any kind of economic inflection point.
And so, one of the reasons why we have done that is not just ability to execute and all the other what our
associates who had done a great job, but more importantly we have a lot of capital always at that time and allow
us to be in position to take advantage or turn crisis into opportunities and so forth. So, I generally inclined to stay
with a little bit more capital and [ph] the group (00:45:51) will continue to watch our ability to generate above
average return of equity for our shareholders as long as we feel that we can do that. And then we will continue to
stay in this position for now until a great opportunity to come along that we may deploy capital differently.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Our board of directors all very engaged. So the beauty of where we are right now, if I looked at from a capital
perspective, we're really looking at the situation that we can just make a Zoom call with our board members any
time and have a discussion to execute a buyback. So it's not like there is any kind of repertory constraint or any of
the other issues. It's very different than when we're building up a separate C&I platform or when we start building
something monumental. So this is something that is very easy to do. And we're always shareholders friendly, and
we know exactly when is the right time to announce a buyback, which we did back in early last year. So, I mean,
that's the part that we â€“ philosophically, we are in line with our shareholders and we will do the right thing. It's just
a matter of like level of confidence that we have right now for potential future opportunities and that's what we're
saying at this point.

Hey, Dominic, I just wanted to follow-up on that prior question. Is there a shift in maybe willingness to do a deal if
you're not going to buy the stock? I mean, I understand the confidence in the growth outlook, but I'm wondering if
a deal might be more on the table in 2021 than it was in prior years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I mean, we're always interest â€“ I mean, you know, if you looked at our capital ratio, we always have the
capital that allow us to look into various opportunities. It's just a matter of like when the right deal come along, we
have the capacity from people perspective, from capital perspective to â€“ actually to enter into a positive
transaction. But you also have to take a look at where we are. If we reflect that from the last very tiny acquisition
that we made was in 2014 for MetroBank in Texas, a very small institution for about $2 billion in size. And at that
time, since then, we've been growing organically. And we've doubled our size in less than six years.
So, we've done pretty well, through organic growth. So our challenge really is more internal. The internal issue is
that, how do we justify any acquisition when we have the ability to double our size in less than six years? And so,
it looked like going forward, we still have that ability to continue to grow organically. And so, from that perspective,
any kind of potential acquisition that we looked at, it needs to be very attractive.
So I mean, that's what we're looking at right now. But when the attractive deal comes along we absolutely will be
interested to look at it. So again, as repeat the same philosophical view that I shared earlier is that, we are
shareholders friendly. We always do what's good for the bank and what's good for the shareholders.

That's great color. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the deposit growth. The tremendous deposit growth you've seen
this year. I'm interested in kind of any niches that are driving a disproportionate amount of that growth in the non-
interest bearing, the ratios it gave, the high 30s percent of total deposit, that's a great ratio. I'm just wondering
what specific businesses might be driving that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It is coming from all over the place. That is that, if I look at the C&I industry verticals that we talked about, so each
and every one of them contributes, even in commercial real estate, we have new commercial real estate
customers that they contributed. I would say â€“ and then, of course, at retail banking, we are actually doing quite
well. So, I would say that not only each and every one of them [ph] a contributor. I think as I shared earlier
(00:51:04) in my remarks is that we brought in quite a few new customers, would generate deposits. And then we
also got increase in deposit from existing customers because through the years of investments in the core
capability, product enhancement in our cash management area, our [ph] payment â€“ so, (00:51:40) our payment
capability is getting better and better that in the past we have customers that while we were having a lending
relationship, we only get a smaller share of the [ph] PDA (00:51:56) because we did not have the technical
capability to serve a more complex cash management business that some of our clients have. These are
somewhat sophisticated larger customers.
The last few years through investing, we continue to improve our cash management and treasury management
capabilities and also ethics, et cetera. So, that gets us to in a position that we are getting a larger wallet share of
this relationship with existing customers. So it's really a combination of both new and existing customers. And I do
want to emphasize is that, we bring in a lot of small retail customers, one customer at a time at the retail
branches. Despite the pandemic, our branches were open every single business day and they are there to attract
new customers. The PPP, PPP first round was very helpful in April. From April to June, we actually brought in
quite a few new customers. So, it's all the combination that got us into where we are today. So I can't think of any
particular one that actually make that big of a difference because it's just across the board.

Thanks. Just going back to, I guess, the margin discussion. I was surprised to see the securities book grow so

Jared, yeah. So in general, I would say, we haven't really taken a lot of credit risk. We have extended the
duration. The duration has gone up quarter-over-quarter. Well, obviously, because of the steepening the curve,
but also the securities that we're purchasing. So as a comparison, we're about [ph] 384 as of 9/30/2020. And
that's inched up to 425 (00:54:19). And generally, if you look at the mix of the securities portfolio, that's
substantially different from what we've had before as far as what we're buying. But overall, certainly given the
lower for a longer environment, we're taking a long hard look at kind of what we're comfortable with from an
interest rate risk perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And then, as far as the increase, certainly, and that's also a function really of us, the comfort level as far as the
deposit and the deposit growth that we anticipate. And then, of course especially with our commercial customers,
sometimes it balances with us can be â€“ go up and down depending on their cash needs. But as we realize that
the excess liquidity throughout 2020 was going to continue, that's why we took the actions of paying off the
PPPLF and then some of the securities, moving more to securities versus keeping in cash.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. [indiscernible] (00:55:26) good color. Thanks. And then, Dominic, I heard you talk about the increased pace
of lending from Greater China. I guess, how do you think that's going to translate into the pace of cross-border
trade expectations and whether that's just pure lending or the opportunity for the growth from that type of business
as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In terms of the Greater China region, I think, that â€“ again, we will expect gradual increase in terms of activities.
And our cross-border team in US actually have done well both â€“ in fact, they've grown both in loans deposit and
fee incomes. And so, what we are looking at in 2021 is also a continuation of gradual increase.
Just because for the last four years under Trump administration that create a lot of hostility between US and
China, the way that I looked at East West is that we know that we have strong knowledge of the business
environment and political environment between US and China. And we are very â€“ with our size, it's much easier
to be nimble to navigate accordingly. So, despite the fact that from the medium perspective, the perception that
US-China business are not doing much at all, but the fact as we somehow find a way to get the business. But as
we go forward in looking at 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration and I just expect that there will be
more predictable approach and it would â€“ I think the Biden administration would bring more stability to the
relationship.
So, from that standpoint, we will most likely be able to gain additional business just because that -because of the
more predictable and more stable environment that customers from both side will be more comfortable to
continue to invest and so forth. They are going to be certain areas, some very, what I call, sensitive industry that
affect national security that obviously will no longer be able to conduct a lot of business between two shores, but
there are plenty of business that are [ph] non-national (00:58:10) security sensitive that I expect will continue,

things such as even tourism, students attending colleges in US and some of the other general manufacturing,
general industries and even in healthcare that do not have these, what I call, very essential purpose in United
States. And we expect that there will be more trade and commerce that take place between the two countries. So,
we know what they are and we will continue to target those business opportunities. That's why I expect that in the
next few years there will be more opportunity to come.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
My first question was just â€“ hi â€“ my first question was just around the multi-family portfolio, it was down slightly
this quarter and the growth I think in 2020, was about a quarter of what it was the prior year. Can you just speak
to your appetite in that asset class and whether or not you're backing away from certain markets and what your â€“
what the prospects are for growth there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are not backing away from multi-family. Our approach has always been we work with our customers that we
know well and that have strong credit history. And whenever these customers request financing from us, we jump
into the opportunity. Now, for multi-family, there is one factor. There are a lot of like Fannie Mae type of pricing
that is hard to beat. Sometimes we have customers that even they've been banking with us for many years and
always look at us as a first right refusal. But there are these very attractive pricing out there that it just makes
sense for them to refi for a very low rate. And we respect that. And so, from that standpoint, we have â€“ I would
say that more like a payoff due to refi for a lower rate type of situation to cause our net growth to be slow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then, just maybe for Irene, the FX and derivative fee income, pretty outsized this quarter. Or is
there something that would make that remain elevated here in the near term, or should we start to normalize that
run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think from a customer income perspective, it was a good quarter for both FX and then IRC, IRC. And if
you â€“ the details of this, Matthew, we have on slide 19 of our deck, you'll see earlier in the year for IRC customer
revenue was much higher. But I'll just point out for the fourth quarter, the CVA marks were positive with the kind of
uptick in the 10 year and then also kind of lower kind of credit costs associated with the interest rate contract.
17

So for the quarter, if you look at IRC, total GAAP revenue was $13 million. Approximately $6.2 million of that was
customer-facing income. And then the CVA adjustment was a positive $6.8 million. FX was up. We had many
more kind of transactions in the fourth quarter particularly kind of quarter-over-quarter and from the earlier part,
and we're optimistic that we'll continue to be able to grow FX year-over-year.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, great. Thanks for the question. You covered Greater China performance already. I was just going to ask in
terms of is that an area now with the change of administration for incremental investment, or do you really feel like
you've already got the pieces on the board that you need?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, in terms of incremental investment, it would depend on the opportunities. What we â€“ we have plenty of
capital to allow the Greater China team to grow if need to be. But [indiscernible] (01:03:11) never really work on a
business model to rely on Greater China to keep fast pace of growth in order for us to generate the kind of
meaningful financial performance for our shareholders. So, Greater China has always been more strategically
important than quantity-driven.
So, from that perspective, we'll continue to look into how we can use Hong Kong and our China team to look in
opportunities. Frankly, in United States, many of our domestic C&I business chose East West as the banker
because of our knowledge of the China business. And often many of them either they're importer or exporter or
they may be buying components from China and so forth have that interconnectivity between US and China. After
all, these are the two largest â€“ US and China the two largest GDP in the world. So, that interconnectivity is out
there for many of the business throughout US.
And our team in China who are able to help to provide advice and services in China or in US for our clients make
a big difference and differentiate East West dramatically from other regional banks that we're competing with. So
that part has been going well. Whether we will need to make additional investment or not, I think that will depend
on any kind of potential changes in regulatory direction from US and China and on what kind of, like, potential
opportunities may come. If there is a great opportunity, again, the previous question about any kind of opportunity
will be interesting to look at. I'd always look at it as, we look at it broadly. And any kind of opportunities that have a
high certainty to provide better return for our shareholders, we looked at it.
So, at this stage right now I don't really have anything specific to mention. I would just say that we always on the
lookout to identify opportunities that to deploy our capital wisely.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Not anything dramatically. I would say that we have always been very much running our organization with a very
sort of like a diversified approach in terms of making sure that we touch on many different industries in US and we
have a good percentage of loans in C&I. And then well-balanced between C&I, CRE and single-family mortgages
from the consumer side. And we are generating a stronger fee income every year from wealth management to
foreign exchange and then cash management fee income and interest rate swap, et cetera, et cetera. So that is
still going to be in place and we are always going to make sure we have a good balance between commercial
banking and retail banking. There are not many banks out there that are competing with us right now with our size
that actually have the strong retail banking business like we do. And so, that's a big advantage for us. And we'll
continue to grow our consumer retail banking business going forward. And the other element of Greater China is
that, as I said earlier, with â€“ there's two big GDP, the world largest and the second largest. And there are plenty of
business for us to identified, particularly for an organization like East West that don't really have much competition
against us because most of the US banks really do not have this as part of the growth element.
So, we looked at [ph] out of that it's why (01:07:39) for years, we said our mission and vision in terms of â€“ in our
business model, to focusing on in this direction. And I would say that this is more or less the same direction that
we'll be focusing on in the next 10 years or so. So, at this, point we're very comfortable with our business strategy
going forward.

second half of 2021. So, should we expect kind of similar C&I growth in the first half of 2021 versus the
annualized growth in the fourth quarter, of course, on an ex-PPP basis. And then, a further pickup in the second
half from there?

No. As I mentioned, I think that maybe in one of the Q&A earlier, our â€“ keep in mind, our fourth quarter annualized
growth rate was 18%. But if you look at the second half of the year, our annualized growth rate was 7% for C&I,
right? 7%.
So we're using the 7% run rate as what we expected for the year. And at this stage, we figure out in the current
environment, just looking at the current environment with â€“ we're still trying to figure out do we have enough
vaccine for everybody or how many more variants of the coronavirus that may popped up. We just looked at it, is
that, maybe the first quarter and two, we wouldn't be expecting business to be coming back as business as usual,

as a strong. But I would expect that after this â€“ by the summer, or after the summer, business is going to come
back really stronger because most of the economy is going to get back into normal. So there will be a pickup then.
So, keep in mind that while we're booking commitment and you look at the utilization rate, we are somewhat of an
all-time low, because normally in the past, we always have about 80% utilization rate, we're dropping down to
70%, the business are not drawing â€“ many of them are not drawing down their lines.
So, we are very pleased that we can book new business, bringing in new customers. But many of them are still
hunkered down and not drawing the lines. And until the economy really see some sort of like normalcy, I would
expect that business will continue to be hesitant to actively draw down the line and actively engage in the [ph] full
flown (01:11:02) business.
So from that standpoint that's why we think that chances are, it's going to be a little bit slower in the first two
quarters and then picking up a little bit stronger in the third and fourth quarter. One other factor is that there's
always seasonality for some of our C&I business that in general things tend to slow down, particular expenses
slow down the first and second quarter because particular the business cater to consumer retail and there's
always like stacking up the inventory right around â€“ near the end of summer and then start [ph] stacking
(01:11:49) it up all the way to near Christmas.
And that type of core business that we have for years is still a meaningful size of business in our C&I portfolio,
and we expect that business â€“ those business would continue to behave accordingly which is a little bit slower in
the first and second quarter, a little bit stronger in the third and fourth quarter because of the utilization behavior.
So, from that standpoint, I think it's a combination of different factors that cause us to conclude with this sort of
like forecast.

Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then shifting to a question on credit, the oil and gas portfolio, classified loans
were $240 million, down 13%. So clearly, stress is easing in this portfolio. Would it be fair to say that the base
case is for continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio and there's potential for reserve releases here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, that's not outside of the realm of possibility. At this point in time, you can just see from the
information that we shared, we did kind of [ph] in chop (01:13:11) the reserve ratio at year-end compared to
September 30. Just honestly given kind of the environment, we want to maintain kind of a conservative view
about that. But I would say that if things continue to improve, the reserve release is within the realm of possibility.
