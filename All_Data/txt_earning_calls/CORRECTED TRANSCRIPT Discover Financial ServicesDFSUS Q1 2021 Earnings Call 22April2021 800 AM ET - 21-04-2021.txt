MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines

Eric Wasserstrom
Vice President & Head of Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our
earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that
appear in today's earnings press release and the presentation.
Our call will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. As

please limit yourself to one question and if you have a follow-up question, please get back into queue so we can
accommodate as many participants as possible.
Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me that a year into the
pandemic, we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends and solid earnings growth, I
wouldn't have believed it, while the pandemic is far from over, and there may be twists and turns ahead. As a
nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy.
This quarter, we earned $1.6 billion after tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect
our robust business model, strong execution, including a disciplined approach to managing credit, improving
economic trends and the impact of federal support for US consumers.
Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has
lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white-collar workforce. And there has also been substantial
support for the US consumer through stimulus in January and in March. Our current expectation is that credit
losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year.
This improved economic view, combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance, were
the primary drivers of the $879 million reserve release in the quarter. As discussed in previous quarters, the
strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan

balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year,
and at their highest level since the year 2000.
While the impact from stimulus payments should abate over the next few months, we expect payment rates will
remain elevated for the rest of the year, as households use savings to meet debt obligations and continue to
benefit from payment relief programs such as federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance.
Despite this pressure, we still expect modest loan growth this year, supported by several factors. First, there has
been a significant increase in sales volume, up 11% from a year ago, and up 15% from the first quarter of 2019.
Improving trends in categories like retail and restaurants are positive signs for future growth.
Additionally, based on our credit performance and our current outlook for macro conditions, we have begun to
migrate our credit standards back to pre-pandemic levels. This is particularly true in card, where our value
proposition centered on best-in-class customer service, valuable rewards and no fees continues to resonate
strongly among consumers. We're also expanding credit standards in personal loans, but not quite back to 2019
norms.
To offset the higher payment rate, as well as leverage these credit actions, we intend to increase our marketing
spending through the rest of this year. Outside of marketing, we expect that expenses will be relatively flat year-
over-year, as we remain committed to expense management. We're reinvesting some of the benefits from our
strong credit performance and efficiency gains into technology and analytics to further improve our account
acquisition targeting, fraud detection, and collections capabilities. The rapid pace of the economic recovery and
strong credit performance may provide additional opportunities to lean further into growth. We intend to take
advantage of these opportunities, and may make additional marketing and non-marketing investments that will
create long-term value.
On the payment side, we continued strong performance in our PULSE business, with volumes up 23% driven by
stimulus payments in the first quarter and higher average spend per transaction. We also continue to expand our
global acceptance through network partnerships, and this quarter we signed new partners in Jordan and
Malaysia.
Our digital banking model generates high returns and we remain committed to returning capital to our
shareholders. This quarter we restarted our share repurchase program with $119 million in buybacks, in line with
the regulatory restrictions still in place. Looking at our strong credit performance and robust earnings, we see an
opportunity to revisit our capital return to shareholders in the second half of the year.
As I look towards the future, I'm excited about Discover's prospects. Our products continue to bring value to our
customers. We remain flexible as we support our employees and their families through the pandemic. And we are
well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn it over to John, one last thing. You may not know it, but our CLO, Wanji Walcott, sits in on these calls
and is a great part of the team. Today is her birthday. So, I want to wish Wanji a very happy birthday.
With that, I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Thank you, Roger. Happy birthday, Wanji. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary
financial results, on slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've
seen over the past few quarters. The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates which pressured
loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter.
Revenue, net of interest expense, decreased 3% from the prior year, mainly from lower net interest income. This
was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates, partially offset by a reduction in
funding costs, as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimize our funding mix.
Non-interest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in
the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects the decline in late fees,
while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year, reflecting the increased sales
volume.
The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly due to an $879 million reserve
release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. Our improved economic
outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit [ph] drove (00:08:18) the release. Additionally, net charge-offs
decreased 30% or $232 million from the prior year.
Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year, as we remained disciplined on expense management. Other
than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year, led by marketing, which decreased 33%
year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year.
We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments.
Moving to loan growth on slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year, driven by a 9% decrease in card
receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors. First, the payment rate remains
elevated, driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows. Second, promotional
balances have continued to decline, reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit.
As a result, these balances were approximately 300 basis points lower than the prior year, although we expect
new account growth will cause promotional balances to begin to stabilize. As the economy reopens further, we
believe consumer spending and prudent expansion of our credit box should drive profitable loan growth going
forward.
Looking at our other lending products, organic student loans increased 5% from the prior year and originations
returned to pre-pandemic levels. We continued to gain market share through the [ph] many peak seasons
(00:09:59).
Personal loans were down 9%, primarily due to actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize credit loss. As
we've previously mentioned, we see opportunity to expand credit a bit, given the strong performance of this
portfolio.
Moving to slide 6. The net interest margin was 10.75%, up 54 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points
sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, the improvement in net interest margin was driven by lower deposit
pricing as we cut our online savings rates from 50 basis points to 40 basis points during the quarter. We also
continue to benefit from the maturity of higher rate CDs and a favorable shift in funding mix. Our funding from
consumer deposits is now at 65%.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Future deposit pricing actions will be dependent upon our funding needs and competitor pricing. Average
consumer deposits were up 14% year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter. Consumer CDs were down 7% from
the prior quarter, while savings and money markets increased 4%. Loan yield was flat to the prior year. Seasonal
revolve rate favorability and a lower mix of promotional rate balances were offset by the impact of reduced pricing
on personal loans.
Looking at slide 7. Total non-interest income was $465 million, down $25 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by
the one-time gain in the prior year that I previously mentioned. Excluding this, non-interest income was up 2%.
Net discount and interchange revenue increased 12%, as revenue from higher sales volume was partially offset
by higher rewards cost. The decrease in loan fee income was driven by lower late fees, which move in line with
delinquency trends.
Looking at slide 8. Total operating expenses are down $78 million, or 7% from the prior year. Marketing and
business development decreased $77 million, or 33% year-over-year. The reduction reflects actions we
implemented in March of last year to align marketing spend with tightened credit criteria. However, we
accelerated our marketing spend late in the first quarter, and plan to continue this through the year. These
investments will drive new account acquisition and loan growth.
The year-over-year decrease in other expenses was mainly driven by lower fraud volume due to enhanced
analytics around disputed transactions and decreased fraud in deposits. This improvement demonstrates a small
part of the benefit we expect from the investments we've made in analytics over the past few years. Partially
offsetting the favorability was a $39 million increase in employment compensation that was driven by two factors;
$22 million from a higher bonus accrual in the current year. The remaining increase was driven by higher average
salaries, reflecting talent build in our technology and analytics team.
Moving to slide 9. We had another strong quarter of very strong credit performance. The total charge-offs were
2.5%, down 79 basis points year-over-year, and up 10 basis points sequentially. The card net charge-off rate was
2.8%, 85 basis points lower than the prior year with the net charge-offs dollars down $209 million, or 31%.
Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points, and net charge-off dollars were up $11
million.
The increase in card net charge-offs from the prior quarter was driven by accounts that have been in Skip-a-Pay
and did not cure. The program ended six months ago, and at this time, most of the accounts that were in Skip-a-
Pay have returned to making payments. Looking forward, we expect minimal impacts to charge-offs from this
population.
The card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.85%, down 77 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points lower
sequentially. With the influence of the Skip-a-Pay group now largely complete, we think that delinquencies are the
most clear indicator of our loss trajectory over the short term.
Credit remains strong in private student loans. Net charge-offs were down 15 basis points year-over-year and 18
basis points compared to the prior quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate improved 55 basis points from the prior
year and 19 basis points sequentially. In personal loans, net charge-offs were down 79 basis points year-over-
year, with a 30-plus delinquency rate down 47 basis points from the prior year, and 24 basis points from the prior
quarter.
The positive impact of additional stimulus combined with an improved economic outlook have shifted our
expectation on the timing of losses. We had previously expected losses will increase in the second half of this

year and remain elevated into 2022. That is no longer the case. Based on our current delinquency trends, we
believe the losses are likely to be flat to down this year with the possibility of some increase in 2022. That said, a
material shift in the economic environment could alter the timing and magnitude of losses.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses, on slide 10. This quarter, we released $879 million from the allowance.
This reflected several factors, including favorable changes to our macro assumptions, a moderate decrease in our
loan balance, a continued decline in delinquencies, and lower losses. Relative to our view in January, the
economic outlook has continued to improve. As we've done in prior quarters, we've modeled several different
scenarios and took a conservative, but more optimistic view. Our assumptions on unemployment were at year-
end 2021 rate of 6%. With a return to full employment in late 2023, we assume GDP growth of about 4.6%.
Our reserve assumptions did not contemplate any additional stimulus direct to consumers, but did anticipate
broader economic benefits from infrastructure spending beginning in the second half of this year. The modest
increase to reserves in our student loan portfolio was driven by loan growth coming out of the [ph] many peak
seasons (00:17:04).
Looking at slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 180 basis points sequentially to 14.9%, well above
our internal target of 10.5%. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share and
repurchased $119 million of common stock during the quarter. Our Board of Directors previously authorized up to
$1.1 billion of repurchases. We will likely accelerate our share repurchases in the second quarter and we see the
potential for capital returns to increase in the second half of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to optimize our funding mix, and consumer deposits now make up 65% of
total funding. Our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits, which we feel is achievable,
though we expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in this figure.
Moving to slide 12. Our perspectives on 2021 have evolved from last quarter. We continue to anticipate modest
positive loan growth for the year. We are investing in new account acquisition and have already seen strong sales
growth through the first quarter. High payment rates will continue to pressure loan growth near term, but should
become less of a headwind over the course of the year.
Versus the first quarter level, we expect our NIM to remain in a relatively narrow range over the rest of the year.
While we'll continue to benefit from improved funding cost and mix, we may experience modest yield pressure
over the next few quarters from variability in the revolve rate.
Our commitment to expense management has not changed, but as Roger mentioned, we believe there is an
opportunity to drive long-term growth through increased marketing and further investments in data and analytics.
Excluding marketing, expenses should be near flat from the prior year. Credit performance has remained stronger
than originally anticipated and we now expect credit losses to be flat to down compared to 2020.
Lastly, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividend and buybacks. Given the level
of reserve release and the strength of our fundamental performance, we plan to revisit our capital plan – capital
return levels for the second half of this year.
In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Our sales trend, credit expansion, and marketing
investments position us well for growth going forward. We released $879 million of reserves. NIM continue to
improve driven by lower funding costs, and expenses were down. But we'll invest in marketing and analytics that
will drive revenue, as well as operating and credit cost improvements over the longer term.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
As the economy reopens, I'm positive regarding the opportunities for growth. We have a strong value proposition
that resonates with our consumers, and our digital banking model positions us well for strong returns going
forward.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Have a question on loan growth and marketing. Roger, you talked about moving
standards to pre-pandemic levels. Maybe you can just talk about the opportunities for growth relative to 2019 and
how we should think about the marketing budget in relation to that. And then maybe you could just also tie in your
confidence level on the loan growth given the stimulus. I mean, it seems like you guys have kept it flat in terms of
loan growth expectations. So maybe just elaborate on that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. Maybe starting then with the stimulus. Clearly, one of the biggest
differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers, the
savings rate, but also the relief they get, be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make.
And so that's a real headwind against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level
since the year 2000.
In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts, about the projected returns we'll get on
those, have widened our credit box [ph] back to (00:22:11) pre-pandemic, although as you recall, we had been
tightening for a couple years, and I would say continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. So I
really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan
growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And when we think about the marketing amount relative to 2019, is there any context you could provide for that?
Sorry for the follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I think part of it – and John indicated this, I think we're probably more comfortable giving you some view
around where we expect total expenses to be. But also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year.
And so to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth, we've been clear, that's
our top priority. And so that's why we'll – we're continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to
marketing.

Hey. Good morning, guys.

Good morning.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Roger, John, on capital, post this quarter's performance, you're at 15% CET1, you talked about reevaluating
in the second half of the year. I guess, given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases, I think it's
safe to say you guys are going to be building capital in the near term. So, how should we think about the
timeframe of getting back to that 10.5% CET1 level and how does CECL day one factor into that? And I guess,
Roger, as a follow-up to that. Just given all the capital sitting around, does it at all change the way you think about
acquisitions and, if so, what would be the priority? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Hey. Ryan, thanks. Thanks for the question I'll start it and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece
of the question. So really, really strong performance and the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations,
as we said in our prepared remarks. So we came into the year somewhat optimistic but also cautious given the
amount of uncertainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad base improvement in the economy. Our credit
fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to – an appropriate decision to
release about $900 million of reserve, taking the, obviously, CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%.
We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition
is somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points, on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of
dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A when and if appropriate. So specifics around timing getting back to
10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of
efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels, in the second half of this year to get there.
And the follow-up might be what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to. We're not going to
give specifics but I will give a little bit of history. If you go back 2017 and 2018, our level of buybacks was about
$2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat. It will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team
internally and, obviously, board approval, but will continue to evaluate. So, Roger, do you want to...

Yeah. And on the M&A front, we try and be disciplined and so, I would say would not let extra money burn a hole
in our pocket. For those of us – for those of you who've been with us for longer, you'll recall we had significant
excess capital post the financial crisis, we're limited by the payout ratios and the CCAR process, but as said, we
will return it over time and stay disciplined.
So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model.
You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers, cost takeout, which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side,
while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially
smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around
returning capital to our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I could squeeze in one other, so, on the slightly higher expenses, John, can you maybe just help us
what is the base for that? Is it GAAP or adjusted? And then second, Roger, there's numerous mentions of
accelerating investments in data, analytics and account growth. Can you maybe just give us a sense for what you
would need to see for those – for you to bring those investments on, in term – whether it's in the macro account
acquisition or what would you expect to drive that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Great. Real quick, first part of your question, the expense growth relative to GAAP last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
And then on the investment side, a lot of those are on capabilities, especially in the data and analytic area that
just enhance all parts of our operations, whether it's the credit underwriting, the marketing targeting,
personalization, collections, et cetera. And so they have given the return profile. Part of it is just bandwidth and
talent, I would say, are more gating factors, but we're really excited about the benefits.
And then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side, it'll vary. Competitive activity has a bit of
an impact on that, but we will just look at on the new account side, what we're seeing across different channels
and carefully, at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Given your commentary on expenses and your plan to invest selectively there on the marketing side, can you
perhaps maybe help us think about the efficiency trend longer term. I know you came in around 38.7% in terms of
the ratio this quarter. Did you think about what is a reasonable long-term expectation, as we look out? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Happy to cover that. So as we went through the pandemic, we really scrutinized the expense base, and
there's been a long history of expense discipline in this company. And through the pandemic, we found certain
opportunities. So, as we think about the balance this year, next year and going forward, we're going to continue to
focus on controlling corporate costs so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers. And we've done
that and we're going to continue to do that.
As we think about the efficiency ratio, we'll come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year, I
think assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans. And going forward, I would
expect somewhere in the upper 30s would be a reasonable spot. That will indicate that we're driving efficiencies
and still investing into business.

Roger and John, there's a lot of debate taking place around what's going to happen with rates, whether we get
more steepening at the long end and when we'll get lift-off at the short end. Is Discover's ability to get to a mid-
20% ROTCE at all impacted, and what happens with rates? Maybe another way to ask it is, can you talk about
your confidence level and being able to get to a, say, mid-25% type ROTCE, even if reserve remains in place?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different
things are happening in the economy. So, you would expect inflation to be increasing, a very, very low level of
unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre-
pandemic levels on a sustained basis. And so you have to believe that a lot of different things are going to happen
and that the Fed also will take some actions to control inflation.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Now, we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on
a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low
and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. Beyond that, it gets different, it is more
difficult to call.
In terms of total return levels, it'll depend on a number of factors, rate is just one of those; credit, obviously, would
be an important item. But certainly, longer term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our
shareholders, consistent with what we've done historically, and our hope is when we come back to that 10.5%
target that that'll further enhance overall returns.

Bill Carcache Q

Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, can you discuss the opportunity in the student lending space, among customers
who may not have been thinking about refinancing their student debt to lower rate when their loans went
forbearance? But as well as start to exit forbearance, is there going to be an opportunity for you guys to see an
acceleration there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we don't really participate in the student loan refi market. The pricing doesn't really meet our return
hurdles. To the extent there is more activity, it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans, but we
feel really good about where we're positioned. And I think last year was very challenging as a lot of kids either
deferred for a year, or had reduced expenses, because they didn't have meals or housing, et cetera. So again, we
feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Couple of questions. One, you were talking earlier about widening standards, in particular, in card. And I just
wanted to get a sense as to what you're expecting that will drive, is that both an increase in accounts as well as
higher lines extended to your existing accounts? And then could you give us some color on how you expect to pull
in the new clients, given the fact that the consumer is in a fantastic spot? Are you pulling from other folks, or do
you feel like this is generating new demand from maybe a younger cohort that's not been borrowing yet? Some
color on that could be helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also
encompasses sort of our line increase in other criteria on the portfolio side as well.
In terms of what we expect, I would say, in all times we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. But we
do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students. Our Secured card is performing well in the
marketplace, but then also the traditional prime revolver segment that Discover's always targeted. It's a very
competitive business. It always has been. So it's about differentiation. And there a superior customer experience,
a great rewards program focus on value, those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and
booking new accounts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
It's interesting, because your value prop, very clear, especially versus other card lenders with no fee, et cetera.
How do you think you're positioned against the fintechs who also have a light or low or no fee proposition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So there aren't that many of the fintechs that are active yet in the card space. By and large, they do loans of
different types. And so we've yet to see a significant, I would say, fintech player in the card space and most of our
competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And if I could squeeze one in for John. You mentioned in answer to the prior question or two ago around
the total expense outlook that you're thinking about for the full year 2021. And I think you mentioned that you're
expecting 2021 to come in similar to the end of 2020. And then from there, as we look to 2022 and beyond,
migrate back towards like the high-30s. Could you just give us some color as to the end of 2020 expense ratio
that you're thinking about, because there's a couple different ways that you could slice it based on one-timers. Is
that a run rate that's north of 40% on the efficiency side, maybe you can help us understand your sizing there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we used a GAAP basis on that. And so, the one-timers that were included in underlying number that
actually we didn't publish, but we called out the underlying numbers. It was about $200 million. So the operating
efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth, payment rate and new account

generation, which, as Roger said, and I'll echo the comment, we're very positive about how we're positioned to
drive growth in this – especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit.
So, what you can expect here, and I'm trying to try to provide as much detail as I can is that outside of the
marketing investments we talked about, some select investments in data and analytics, we're looking to keep all
other costs flat. And we're going to manage that envelope, as we see opportunities, but we'll be able to use that
as a jumping-off point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in 2022 and beyond.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Just hoping you could give us some color on where we should expect the reserve ratio to migrate to. Is it
appropriate to think about it going back to kind of the CECL day-one level, and if so, at what pace could we get
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thank you. So, we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels this quarter. Honestly, the credit
outlook and our models indicated that there was a range of different outcomes we could have made on that. And
what we tried to do was take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense, given the level of absolute uncertainty
in the economy. As we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the
macros, how the portfolio is performing, and what we do in terms of account growth, loan balance.
But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the day one CECL rate as a
decent proxy. And subject to how the portfolio is performing, it could migrate up or down from there. What we did
last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly dynamic and changing macro
environment, and we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. So the portfolio performs. Over time, we could get
back to that CECL day one and perhaps a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. Now, timing, I'm not
going to be specific at.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Roger, as we went through the pandemic, obviously, there's more e-commerce spend. And is
there anything that you've learned in terms of like how you would position the company differently? It seems like
big tech and technology are continuing to gain more touch points with customers. Is there anything strategically
that you want to lean into or you've learned?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great question. I think it really accelerated a lot of trends that were existing prior to pandemic, right. So,
consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online, but that's moved even quicker. Their
customer interactions were moving more towards digital. That accelerated even further. So I think that it has
recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality.
Certainly, there were some specific things around the tap-and-go cards, a lot of small dollar transactions migrating
from cash to debit that benefited our PULSE volumes. But I would say, in general, not so much new trends but
three, four or five-year accelerations of trends that were already there, and that we had been positioning the
company to take advantage of.

Donald Fandetti Q

Got it. And on the potential investments or partnerships, would those be accretive or could they potentially be
more technology investments?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Where we traditionally made them on the payment side is with partners. They either add capabilities or to cement
a relationship that will drive volume over our network. On the technology side, we found plenty of great
partners/vendors out there that you don't need – people don't need money in the current environment, and so
that's why we've tended not to do investments in pure technology companies that aren't payments related.

As you look forward to loan growth, how much opportunity is there to category-specific rebound that's more [ph] in
depth to (44:36) borrow, like travel, for example?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Great question. I think that will be constructive. Some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn
though had a pretty good revolve rate. So you think about home improvement, that was really doing well. So, a lot
of it, I think, will be in the restaurant and travel segment, but I wouldn't necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve
rate, just given again some of the categories that were strong in the downturn.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Just really quickly, I wanted to ask about competitive
intensity. First, are you seeing any impact on cost of acquisition as customers have come back? I know that has
trended very well last year and that's an area you will be making investments in.
And then maybe I'll just ask my – the related question I had on that. Last year, Discover's no annual fee, no
cashback card was just really well suited for the backdrop. As we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more
relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact on your usage? Any early indicators from consumers who had

maybe moved your card to top of wallet last year and what you're seeing? So just I guess competitive intensity,
more broadly. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We are not seeing an impact. And we think the lesson learned in the
pandemic of the utility of cash rewards, hopefully, will last. And we feel very good about even the newer
redemption offers we've added. So the ability to redeem at point of sale, at PayPal, with Amazon, we just
announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. So, no real
change to that.
In terms of competitive intensity, we talked about, I would say, just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last
year as there was a significant pullback. I think we're now moving towards more normalized levels of competition.
And my guess is we'll see that increase. But our job is to grow the business in face of competition that's there.
And so, while I missed the CPAs from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing
even in a more intense environment.

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
First question, Roger, you addressed some of this. With respect to loan growth, maybe you talked about it being a
mix of line utilization, new customers. I'm wondering is there one bigger contribution to that relative to the others?
And what's the cadence, is this more of a second half factor or is this going to be balanced over the course of the
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, on the cadence, I do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year. They weren't
overly large Q1, but again with the wider credit box, we'll get more leverage for the marketing spend, so we would
expect a ramp, but we'll look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit.
In terms of the impact of the credit changes, it's probably more heavily weighted towards the new account side
versus portfolio, but we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I'd just say, John, I guess, more of a kind of constant question is, we're a year into CECL now and, obviously, it's
had a pretty big impact in how things have turned out from a GAAP perspective. How do you stack the major
decision-making factors with respect to your ALL now? Is it the Moody's model? Is that unemployment? Is it just
your internal opinion of your performance trends? How have things changed with respect to the way you look at
that ALL level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Good question. So certainly, evolving. So we use Moody's and also two other providers. So the broad
macros are very important. The portfolio performance itself is also, obviously, a key input. And we have a team of
technical modelers that run various scenarios, regression sort of scenarios to help make a determination on what
overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input, because there's probably 12, 12 to 15 different variables
that go into that model that help do the projection.
And then the other piece is, your loan balance, right. And what you have on the balance sheet as of the
measurement date in order to set reserve. So I would say, all of those factors are important. And then finally, one
other one is recovery rate, which actually also does go into the model.
So four important factors, and we've taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately
stated, and we're on the conservative end of the judgment calls.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. [indiscernible] (00:50:53) travel and restaurants and retail seem to

John T. Greene A

Yeah. Yeah. We have actually incredibly the sales performance, the first three weeks of April versus 2019,
overall, we're up about 17%. And it's three weeks into the month, so things can change. And then versus last year
was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic, we're up 68% on sales. So, really strong there and then the
mix between revolvers and transactors, obviously, transactors are up higher than revolvers, but revolvers are up
almost near double-digits versus prior year. So all good.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been already asked and answered, but maybe if you could
just follow up on two quick points. One is the payment rate stubborn – stubbornly high payment rates and how
that will likely decline. I mean, is there – I guess maybe the question is, how much of that is a function of the
actual stimulus dollars versus some of the ongoing impacts that you highlighted, whether it's enhanced
unemployment benefits or student loan interest forbearance in terms of thinking about the pace of that decline?
And then just very quickly, you talked about the CECL day one, just conceptually, do you think that the life of loan
has a higher or lower likelihood on January 1, 2022 of a near-term recession you did on January 1, 2020?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So I'll cover the first part, and I'll let John forecast recessions. In terms of the elevated payment rate, it is a mixed,
but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support. And so, we do expect it to come down over the
course of the year, but remain elevated compared to historic levels, and this is because households have a lot of
savings withdrawn and there are just a lot of other forms of support. So it's not – it is a headwind against loan
growth. It's really being driven by external factors. So I would say, we're not overly alarmed about it. And again,
we would expect it to start drifting downward, as we get further past the really extraordinary levels of government
stimulus. And I'll pass it to John for questions on reserves.

Great. So, yeah, I think what you're getting at is what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year
forecasting out the 2022. So, today, obviously, there's no perfect answer or perfect insight. I will say this, the pent-
up demand for consumers, I believe, is fairly pronounced and will continue to drive spending activity through this
year and well into next year. So that to me indicates that the macros should be positive through 2022; beyond
2022, it's really difficult to call at this point.

Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the investments that you're making on data,
analytics and driving account growth? And also, is there any way to quantify how much incremental spend you're
putting into that and returns that are being generated from that, whether it's additional growth or other trends that
we can identify to quantify the growth or the investment returns that you're getting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great. So I'll hit the second part of that question first. So, in terms of returns, we have a rigorous process
where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash on cash returns. And in
terms of ROEs or return thresholds, I won't be specific, but very, very strong double-digits [ph] on those,
(00:56:17) in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital.
In terms of what we're investing in data, analytics on – specifically on looking at attrition from the portfolio, we feel
like there's an opportunity to reduce attrition level through some early identification of customers who may not be
maximizing the usage of the card. We have data analytics projects going on in collections. I mentioned in our
prepared remarks in fraud and fraud analytics. So, there's – frankly, there's almost insatiable demand for these
sorts of programs, and what we are – we're being very, very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize
the highest returning ones in the current year.

Dominick Gabriele Q

Okay. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the expenses, and sorry I don't
mean to beat the dead horse here. If you look at the GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, they
were almost about $1.3 billion. Are we expecting a quarter that could be that high or just because there was – it
seemed to be a little – I got a little confused on one of the comments there. So is that reasonable to think that one
of the quarters could be near that $1.3 billion level?

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So I'm certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly. I will tell you this from an expense standpoint.
The marketing expense for the balance of the year, we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope
we talked about earlier. The quarter-over-quarter comparisons are, frankly, relatively challenging, given what
happened in 2020 in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially was going out of
the – out the door on an expense item. So I would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly breakouts,
I'll leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense. We hear and we're looking at that 2021 and 2022 and
don't specifically try to manage to any particularly – particular quarter – quarterly number.

Makes sense. And then, I guess, if you kind of look at what happened this quarter with the kind of benefits that
you guys have with having not only a lending business, but one that also gains interchange, that really helped
offset some of the slowdown in loans. I guess, do you expect that we could see that Discover's proprietary
network being much higher as far as a growth base is going forward year-over-year versus your loan growth in
2021? Do you expect that divergence to be there for, at least, a few quarters? Thanks so much, guys. Really
appreciate it.

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our third-party payments areas. If you
include the debit side, PULSE is growing very strongly, and so that's helpful. But we also believe that having a
proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our
banking business. So again, total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners, and we are a little
skewed towards debit for the third-parties, but we're going to work for a continued robust volume growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks so much.
