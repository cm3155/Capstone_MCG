Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Well, thank you, Paul, and good afternoon. I'm Andy Harmening and I'm joined once again by our Chief Financial
Officer, Derek Meyer, and our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern. I'd like to start off by sharing some highlights from
the quarter. And then from there, Derek will provide a few updates on our margin, income statement and capital
trends, and Paul will provide an update on credit.
Midway through 2024, we have remained squarely focused on supporting our markets while continuing to execute
on our plans, to grow our customer base, deepen our relationship and enhance our profitability.
In the context of the broader US economy, we remain pleased with the stability and resilience of our upper
Midwest footprint. Several states, including Wisconsin and Minnesota, remain below 3% unemployment. Our
prime/super prime consumer base has largely taken inflation in stride, and our commercial clients have remained
upbeat while navigating a challenging rate environment.
With these trends as a backdrop, our credit performance remained solid here in the second quarter.
Delinquencies, criticized loans and net charge-offs all decreased versus the prior quarter. And we've steadily
added to our provision over the past several quarters. To-date, we have yet to see any meaningful negative
trends that are concerning with regards to specific asset classes or geographies.
This stability is a reflection of our home markets, but it's also a reflection of our disciplined, proactive approach
we've taken as a company. We've anchored ourselves in familiar Midwest markets, and we've developed a
diversified CRE portfolio with limited exposure to [ph] downtown (00:03:21) office properties and other key
pressure points. And while we're pleased with the results we've seen to date, our experienced team remains
vigilant, methodical in reviewing our portfolios on a continual basis to ensure we're staying ahead of any issues
that may emerge down the road.
Thanks to our strong credit foundation, we've stayed on offense, steadily executing on our strategic plan. This
pattern of execution was established shortly after I joined when we launched Phase 1 of our plan back in
September of 2021. Over three years, we've built a foundation for growth. We've enhanced our lending
capabilities through the addition of new loan verticals and expansion of our commercial team.
We've strengthened our ability to attract, deepen and retain customer relationships through product, service and
marketing enhancements. And we've invested significantly into digital to better compete in an evolving financial
services landscape. The tailwinds of Phase 1 enhancements continue to benefit our company in exciting ways.
We're seeing meaningful improvement in our customer satisfaction scores where after being named number one
in Retail Customer Satisfaction by J.D. Power in April, we're now seeing the highest Net Promoter Scores we've
seen as a company since we started tracking internally in 2017.
Customers today are more likely to recommend Associated Bank to friends and family than they have been in
years. We've seen household growth where after several year period of negative trends, we've seen a net positive
growth in consumer checking households in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. In fact, net households grew at a faster
rate in the second quarter than they have in any other quarter in over a decade. And we're not just opening more
accounts. They are higher quality accounts as well.
Year-to-date, we've seen a 26% increase in deposit balances per new checking customer as compared to last
year, 2023. And while these trends are fun to talk about, they are also foundational for revenue growth, and our
ability to transform our profitability profile over time, and they give us confidence that we're on the right path.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Phase 2 of our plan is designed to build on this momentum by accelerating our organic growth strategy and
midway through the year, we remain on track. Since April, we've made several additional key leadership hires,
further expanded our promising mass affluent program, and launched new marketing tactics.
Just this week, we launched another upgrade of our digital platform with a new credit monitoring tool, enabling
digital customers to easily track their credit score and safeguard their financial future. As I mentioned back in
April, we expect our Phase 2 initiatives to have an increasing impact as we get to the back half of 2024 and into
2025.
Looking forward, the progress we've made to-date against our strategic plan is foundational for our company.
We've combined legacy strengths in credit and expense management with initiatives that help us grow and
deepen our customer base, enhance profitability and accrete capital.
While the macroeconomic path is somewhat uncertain in the near term, we feel well-positioned to work through
that uncertainty and to accelerate with a growing economy, thanks to tailwinds from initiatives already completed
and incremental momentum from Phase 2. Simply put, we remain on track towards creating a stronger return
profile for Associated Bank and our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to walk through some financial highlights from the second quarter beginning on slide 2. On a
GAAP basis, our earnings per share came in at $0.74 for the quarter. This figure includes a one-time $33 million
tax benefit resulting from a strategic reallocation of our investment portfolio. Excluding this one-time impact, our
adjusted EPS was $0.52 or flat versus Q1. This figure demonstrates the underlying ability of our earning profile in
what has continued to be a challenging operating environment for banks.
During the quarter, we continued to remix the asset side of the balance sheet, with average loan growth of $211
million. Once again, this growth was led by commercial and our prime/super prime auto book. But the pace of
loan growth slowed in several categories due to payoffs and slightly lower loan demand in an elevated rate
environment. Average core customer deposits decreased by less than 1% in what is typically a slower growth â€“
deposit growth quarter for the bank. This broad trend was largely in line with our expectations, and we remain
confident in our ability to grow our core customer deposits in the back half of the year.
Shifting to the income statement, asset yields and a shift in our funding mix together drove a $1 million decrease
in net interest income. Non-interest income trends have remained stable overall, with continued momentum from
our wealth business leading the way on fee-based revenue.
On the expense front, we continue to invest in our initiatives, but discipline remains a foundational focus for our
company. Total interest expense came in at $196 million for the quarter, and we will continue to diligently manage
our expense level as we execute against our growth strategy throughout the year.
Shifting to capital. The stability of our core profitability, combined with the one-time tax benefit recognized during
the quarter, added meaningfully to our accretion of our capital ratios. Here in Q2, our CET1 finished at 9.68% or
25 basis point increase relative to Q1.
And finally, our conservative approach to credit continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy. Here in Q2, asset
quality remained solid with delinquencies, criticized loans and net charge-offs, all down compared to prior quarter.
We remain committed to staying ahead of the curve by taking a disciplined, consistent approach to loan risk
ratings, so we can better understand credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography. As always, we
will continue to monitor asset quality closely.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
On slide 3, we provided a walk forward of our GAAP and adjusted EPS to more clearly display the impact of the
$33 million tax benefit we incurred during the second quarter. As mentioned, this one-time item was a result of a
strategic reallocation of our investment securities portfolio. This represented a $0.22 impact to our EPS for the
quarter. Adjusting for this one-time item, EPS of $0.52 was flat compared to the first quarter.
Moving to slide 4, I'd like to provide a little bit more color on where we are with our strategic plan and how we're
setting up to create a stronger Associated. Since announcing Phase 1 of the plan back in 2021, we've added
several new loan verticals, grown our commercial RM base, upgraded our product set, invested in digital
transformation, and amplified our brand presence throughout the footprint. These investments have generated
several tailwinds that are foundational for our company. We diversified our asset base by adding nearly $800
million in asset-based lending and equipment finance verticals, and $2.5 billion in prime/super prime auto loans.
We've expanded our commercial RM base 29% since 2021. We've added over $1 billion in net new mass affluent
deposits since launching the program in December of 2022. We've seen meaningful improvements in customer
satisfaction scores where after being named number one in Retail Banking Customer Satisfaction by J.D. Power
in April, we are now seeing a four-and-a-half year high in our digital satisfaction scores and the highest Net
Promoter Scores we've seen since started tracking this metric in 2017.
And finally, we are now growing primary checking households at Associated, reversing a steady trend of net
decreases over the past decade. After posting net growth across the board in consumer, business and wealth
households in Q1, we posted the highest consumer checking household growth we've seen in over a decade in
Q2. We're also seeing higher quality accounts being opened, with the deposit balances per new household up
26% versus 2023. We continue to believe that customer growth and higher quality accounts will deliver enhanced
financial tailwinds over time.
Shifting to slide 5. Phase 2 of our plan leverages foundational tailwinds up from Phase 1 and an infusion of
proven leaders in key areas across the bank to accelerate momentum as a company. We continue to expand and
deepen our talent base.
Over the past two years, we've added a number of executives and key leaders across the bank who are uniquely
positioned to support and amplify our growth strategy. That's particularly true on the commercial side, where most
recently we added [ph] Mike Levins (00:12:06) to our commercial team in Minnesota.
Mike joined us in May after 20 years with Wells Fargo, where he most recently served as the division portfolio
executive for six states, including Minnesota and Wisconsin. Whether at the executive level or on the front line,
having the right people in the right places is essential to the success of our strategic plan.
With that in mind, we're also progressing on our plan to hire 26 additional commercial RMs, which represents an
incremental 28% increase versus September of 2023. While the recent hires we've made to-date are already
making a valuable contribution in the short time with Associated, we're confident that their impact will grow over
time.
As we continue to add talent to our team, we've also made steady quarterly progress with our product, marketing
and digital initiatives in Phase 2. After launching a new social media campaign in Q1 to amplify our brand and
highlight our products and services, we expanded that campaign through a partnership with multiple social media
influencers in Q2, including local Wisconsin-based Charlie Berens. We've also continued to expand our mass
affluent program, providing training for bankers across our footprint.

Associated Banc-Corp

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Since launching Phase 2 in November, we've trained an additional 28 bankers to manage mass affluent
relationships, and we now have a total of 58 bankers who are specially trained to handle these unique
relationships, helping to grow this promising segment for the bank.
And just this week, we introduced a new credit monitor tool for our digital customers. Taken together with the
enhancements we've already made, actions like these are expected to bolster our efforts to attract new customers
and deepen existing relationships.
While we remain encouraged by the ongoing momentum we've seen from Phase 2, we expect our Phase 2
initiatives to have a more meaningful impact on our financial results, as we get to the back half of 2024 and into
2025. This gives us confidence that we're on the right track with our strategic plan. And as such, we continue to
expect cumulative incremental commercial loan growth of $750 million and cumulative incremental deposit
balances of $2.5 billion and an annual household growth rate of 3% by the year end 2025.
On slide 6, this is just a reminder that we are in the process of remixing our balance sheet to drive higher returns
through multiple different efforts.
I'll quickly transition to slide 7. I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the second quarter, beginning
with loans on slide 7. On a quarterly basis, loans grew by $211 million during the second quarter, led once again
by our C&I and auto portfolios. We've continued to emphasize these two areas as a way to help remix our
balance sheet over time and decrease our reliance on low yielding, low relationship asset classes, and to
enhance our return profile while still maintaining solid credit standards.
With that said, we did see the rate of growth slow in the second quarter, particularly in auto book, where we saw
softer demand across our dealer network in Q2. We were also impacted by elevated payoffs in our CRE portfolio
and saw average CRE loans decrease by $140 million during the quarter. Across our broader portfolio, we
continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles and
diversification to deliver improved returns. While we continue to expect tailwinds from our initiatives in the back
half of the year, we now expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our range of 4% to 6% due to market
conditions and previously mentioned increase in CRE payoffs.
Moving to slide 8. We mentioned back in April that our Q1 deposit trends were somewhat inflated by seasonality
and as we expected, those balances normalized in Q2. While the second quarter's typically a slower seasonal
growth quarter for Associated Bank anyway, we also saw an unusually large swing in our point-to-point balance
flows relative to the first quarter. This period end decrease was largely a timing issue, driven by disbursement of
seasonal balances that were expected to flow out before the end of Q1, but didn't flow out until early Q2. This
timing issue was a key driver in the period end flows in both total deposits and DDA. Nonetheless, the broader
trend over the first half of the year has largely remained in line with what we've communicated previously. We
expected balances to bottom in Q2 and then grow modestly the rest of the year. That continues to be our
expectation. On a quarterly average basis, which allows for a more normalized view of these flows, core customer
deposits decreased by less than 1%.
Slide 9, we include a broader three-quarter view of our quarterly average deposit trends more clearly show the
stability we've seen in the first half of the year. Despite the lumpy point-to-point balances between Q1 and Q2,
quarterly average core customer deposits were essentially flat from Q4 of 2023 to Q2 of 2024; in fact, they were
slightly up. As discussed earlier, we continue to feel very well-positioned for core customer growth in the coming
quarters due to expected tailwinds from promising, leading indicators such as customer household growth and

satisfaction metrics. These leading indicators are foundational changes for our company that will enable us to
sustainably grow our customer base over time.
While we remain confident in our ability to deliver core customer deposit growth over the back half of 2024, the
market for deposits has remained competitive in this higher for longer environment. Due to current market
conditions, we now expect core customer deposits to finish 2024 at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range given
previously.
So, with that, I'll pass it on to Derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends. Derek?

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. I'll start on slide 10 with some color on our asset, and liability and yield trends. While the target Fed
funds rate has remained stable since July of last year, we've continued to see asset yields inch higher in most
major loan categories, including C&I, auto and mortgage here in Q2.
We also saw our investment yields increase 14 basis points during the quarter as we continue to benefit from the
securities repositioning we completed last year. With that said, our overall Q2 earning asset yield was also
negatively impacted by 2 basis points relative to Q1 due to a lower level of non-accrual interest rate recoveries,
particularly within CRE and C&I loans. Taken together with the core growth in our loan and securities yields
mentioned previously, our earning asset yields increased by 1 basis points and landed at 565% during the second
quarter.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, we continue to see lingering funding cost pressures due primarily to
elevated wholesale funding costs. We've actually seen both our cost of total interest-bearing deposits and cost of
total deposits, decrease slightly in Q2. These trends were more than offset by the addition of higher cost
wholesale funding during the quarter. All in, our cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 5 basis points to
3.6% for the quarter.
On slide 11, the trends I just described netted out to 4 basis point decrease in our quarterly net interest margin,
with 2 basis points impact coming from the quarterly swing in recoveries on the asset yield side and the other 2
basis points attributed to higher funding costs. Despite this pressure on NIM, our net interest income has
remained stable. The $257 million we posted in Q2 was down just $1 million from Q1 and it was higher than our
NII in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit
betas and fed action, we expect sequential growth in our net interest income over the remainder of the year and
NIM expansion by year end.
With that said, given market conditions, we now expect to drive net interest income growth of between 1% and
3% in 2024. This guidance assumes two 25 basis point Fed cuts by year end, beginning in September.
Shifting to slide 12, we've continued to manage our securities book within our 18% to 20% target range. With the
benefit of higher rates, combined with the securities repositioning we completed last year, the average yield on
our securities book has now risen by 64 basis points from the same period a year ago. On a dollar basis, both our
cash and investment securities positions increased slightly versus Q1, but as a percent of total assets, these
positions held firm at 21% in Q2. Over the remainder of 2024, we will continue to target investments to total
assets of between 18% and 20%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
On slide 13, we highlight our non-interest income trends throughout the second quarter. Our non-interest income
came in at $65 million for the quarter, which was up slightly compared to Q1 and down slightly from the same
period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income was up $3 million or 2% compared to 2023.
During the second quarter, our results were highlighted by growth in wealth management fees, card-based fees
and BOLI income. This was partially offset by a $4 million decrease in net investment securities gains, with the
decrease driven by the $4 million gain on sale of Visa B shares we booked back in Q1. As a reminder, we have
no Visa B shares remaining as of March 31st. We continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our non-interest
income in the challenging environment, and we now full year 2024 non-interest income to finish plus or minus 1%
as compared to our 2023 adjusted base of $264 million.
Moving to slide 14, we've continued to manage our expense base diligently despite ongoing investments to
support our growth initiatives. This discipline remains a foundational focus across the company. Our second
quarter expenses of $196 million were down $2 million from the prior quarter. But embedded in our Q2 number
was a $2 million adjustment of the FDIC special assessment expense booked in Q1 following an updated
estimate received from the FDIC here in Q2.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio increased from the multi-quarter low we now posted in Q1, but our non-interest
expense to average assets ratio continued to decrease in the second quarter, landing at 1.92%. This metric
underscores our ability to keep expenses in check while continuing to invest in our organic growth strategy. We
continue to expect total non-interest expense growth of between 2% and 3% in 2024 off of our adjusted 2023
base of $783 million. These figures exclude the FDIC special assessment impacts in Q4, Q1 and Q2.
Shifting to slide 15, our stable core profitability trends, combined with the one-time tax benefit booked during the
quarter, drove meaningful capital accretion across the board in Q2. We saw a 10 basis point net increase in our
TCE ratio during the quarter, finishing at 7.18%. This net increase was driven by improved profitability, partially
offset by asset growth in the denominator.
After falling to 9.39% as a result of our balance sheet repositioning in Q4, our CET1 rebounded to 9.43% in Q1
and finished Q2 at 9.68%, the highest CET1 ratio we've posted in two years. Both our TCE and CET1 remain well
within our 2024 target ranges as of Q2. Given current market conditions, we continue to expect TCE to remain in
the range of 6.75% to 7.75% in 2024. We also expect CET1 to remain in a range of 9% to 10% over the same
timeframe.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern to provide an update on credit quality.

Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start our credit portion with our allowance update on slide 16. We've utilized the Moody's
[ph] May (00:24:15) 2024 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline
forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline
forecast contains no additional rate hikes, slower, but positive GDP growth rate, a cooling labor market and
continued deceleration of inflation.
Our ACLL increased by another $2 million in Q2 to finish the quarter at $390 million, with increases in CRE
Construction and other consumer categories partially offset by decreases in commercial and business lending,
CRE Investor and resi mortgage. Our allowance continues to be driven primarily by loan growth in select areas
such as auto, nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our Midwest
8


Associated Banc-Corp

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
footprint. As such, our reserve-to-loan ratio landed at 1.32% here in Q2, up 1 basis point versus Q1 and up 6
basis points compared to the same period a year ago.
Moving to slide 17, we've continued to see solid performance in our core credit quality trends, with credit metric
changes reflective of the continued theme of normalization within the portfolio. At the top of the pipeline, total
bank-wide delinquencies have decreased for the second consecutive quarter. With $37 million in total
delinquencies in Q2, this figure represents a $14 million improvement from the prior quarter and a $4 million
improvement from the same period a year ago.
Delinquencies often serve as an early warning sign of stress in the portfolio, so we've been pleased to see the
improvement in these numbers, despite a challenging macro environment in 2024.
Further down the line, total criticized and classified loan trends also improved slightly for the third consecutive
quarter. While we did see an uptick in the substandard accruing bucket, this is more than offset by decreases in
our special mention and non-accrual segments. We remain encouraged with the stability of total criticized assets
and the decrease in those credits showing early stress.
Within the non-accrual bucket specifically, we continue to see puts and takes consistent with our normal course of
business in Q2. We did see an uptick in non-accruals within CRE, which is largely driven by a CRE office credit.
However, early indication is, we are leading to a path towards favorable resolution with this credit in Q3. Outside
of that one particular credit, total non-accruals would have decreased even further for the quarter, which we see
as another sign of overall credit stability.
Finally, we booked $21 million in net charge-offs during the quarter and $23 million in provision, both of which
represented a $1 million decrease from Q1. The overall net charge-off rate still remains within 2024 expectations.
Taken together, our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that we've seen to-date is a handful of credits
migrating to our rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future
quarters. Overall, outside of these specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity
we've seen across the bank.
As we've done over the past couple of years, our ongoing quarterly portfolio deep dive and risk rating analysis
remain a focus and a key tool to stay ahead of credit concerns, given the uncertain macro outlook noted earlier.
As we look to the back half of 2024, we remain diligent and monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to
ensure current underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures and labor costs, to name just a few economic
concerns. In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the
portfolio, including our ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. Going forward, we expect [ph] any
(00:28:14) provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes
and other indications of credit quality.
Finally, we've provided a refresh of key CRE metrics on slide 18. As a reminder, our conservative approach to
credit has been optimized over the course of the past several years, as we've built a diverse portfolio of high-
quality commercial loans across our portfolios with a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolios. While
CRE continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry, we feel well-positioned given the conservative
approach we've applied across the bank. In building our CRE portfolio, we've focused on partnering with well-
known developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable Midwest markets. Two-thirds of our CRE portfolio
[ph] is currently in (00:29:03) Midwest, with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties. We do not have
any exposure to the rent-controlled New York City real estate market.

Office loans now represent just 3.4% of our total loans as a bank. Within that portfolio, we are weighted towards
Class-A properties in non-urban environments. We continue to take a proactive approach to CRE office credits,
with the majority of those maturing for the remainder of 2024 already having strategies in place, whether that be
refinance, sale or qualifying for exchange at prevailing underwriting standards. While we feel well-positioned given
our business model approach in the markets we operate in, we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios
closely.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. I'll wrap this up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 19. First, our
strategy emphasizes quality relationship focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on low yielding, non-
relationship balances and enhances our profitability profile. While we continue to expect tailwinds from our
initiatives in the back half of the year, we now expect total loan growth to land at the lower end of our original
range of 4% to 6% due to current market conditions and previous previously mentioned increase in CRE payoffs.
On the other side of the balance sheet, we've been pleased with the momentum we've seen from leading
indicators such as household growth, quality of accounts and customer satisfaction scores, which are
foundational for growing your customer base and delivering quality deposit growth. We're also encouraged by our
ongoing cadence of product, service and marketing enhancements expected to help build on that, and we expect
that to help build on our momentum in the coming quarters. Due to current market conditions, we now expect core
customer deposit growth to finish 2024 at the lower end of our 3% to 5% range that was given previously.
On the income statement, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and
rate environment. Our latest forecast assumes two Fed rate cuts beginning in September. And taking these
factors into account, we now expect net interest income growth of between 1% and 3% in 2024.
We continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our non-interest income in a [ph] challenged (00:31:28)
environment. And as such, we've updated our full year 2024 growth guide to plus or minus 1%.
And finally, our disciplined approach to expense remain foundational for the company. And with this in mind, we
continue to expect non-interest expense growth of 2% to 3% in 2024, after excluding the impact of FDIC special
assessment expenses in Q4, Q1 and Q2.
So, with that, let's open it up for questions.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you. Appreciate it. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe first â€“ yes, maybe first, just to start on the net interest
income guidance. Just back of the envelope, as I look at what you guys have done in the first half and the
guidance for the full year, it looks like there's some solid NIM expansion that I would assume or bake in the back
half the year guidance. Am I thinking about that right? I think I heard you say the NIM expansion you're expecting
by the end of the year. Not sure if we should think about that as kind of stable in the third quarter and then more
meaningful in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can help me just in terms of how I'm thinking about the dynamics for
the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. So, this is Andy, I'll start this off and then turn it over to Derek. I'd say what I'd emphasize is, we expect
deposit growth and we expect loan growth in both the third and the fourth quarter. So, with that, we're expecting a
steady expansion of our NIM throughout the second half of the year. And so, maybe Derek put a finer point on
that.

Yes. I think you've got it right. The NII, we expect to sequentially increase both third and fourth quarter and margin
expansion in both quarters, handful of basis points each one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. Great. Thanks for that help. And then maybe looking at the expense guidance, seems like â€“ well, I
guess, just first, a clarification, the adjustment, related to the FDIC assessment in the second quarter, was that a
negative adjustment? So the operating number was higher than the reported number or I just want to make sure I
have that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
That's correct, it was $2 million unwind, [ph] but (00:34:28) debit accrual based on receiving the actual bill from
the FDIC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. That makes more sense [ph] with the guide then (00:34:37). It still implies a little bit of a pickup, I
guess, in expenses in the back half from what you guys have done in the front half, is that â€“ should we think about
that being kind of personnel driven with the hirings that you guys have been making?

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Derek, maybe if we could walk through the idea of
margin expansion in the back half, maybe just a little more color on what you expect the puts and takes to be that
would allow for a few basis points of expansion in each of the next couple of quarters. I guess, the background is
â€“ the context is where you're starting at a little bit of a lower base, and I thought the real juice for the margin would
have been the sort of the lingering benefits of the securities portfolio restructuring. So I guess base question is,
what is it that allows the margin to expand from here? Is it Fed rate cuts or is it just sort of richer balance sheet
mix with the net-net of loan growth, as well as core deposit growth? How do those dynamics all play out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes, it's more mix driven. Although we run this obviously with the rate cuts each time, that matters less and less.
Now, we have two rate cuts assumed, one in September, one in November, but more of it is continued trickling up
of the investment portfolio, the auto book, both of those happen â€“ and a little bit of the resi. Both of those happen
regardless of a lot of movement from the Fed. And then as we expect to see these RMs bring in C&I growth at
rates that you saw sort of at the end of Phase 1, those â€“ that should help us replace some of this lower yield in
resi as it rolls off. Then on the â€“ and then you have two levers, but clearly, the mix on the deposit piece, as we
expect deposit growth, you expect the mix on the wholesale piece to drop. But then if you also look at the quarter-
over-quarter change and our interest-bearing deposits, we already sort of telegraphed those costs coming down a
little bit and we expect with a rate cut that that'll allow us from a customer perception standpoint, to be a little bit
more efficient on that front also.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Thank you for that. And then Andy or Derek, just on the lower loan growth expectation, I guess I'm
hoping you could unpack a little more, just sort of as you weigh, how much of this is lower demand versus how
much is sort of profitability within the existing growth aspirations? And then the company specific nuance that
you've always had is the new hires. I imagine they're producing as hoped, but would just love to hear your color
on sort of the umbrella of all three of those things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. So, this is Andy. I'll take that one. First thing I'd say it is â€“ it's the lower end of the range. So, we're staying
within the range that we forecasted or gave guidance on at the beginning of the year. Then there are a few puts
and takes within that. We've been proactively managing our CRE book and we've had some payoffs and we're
fine with that. So that takes it down a little bit. It puts us in a pretty good position credit wise. We've seen the auto
industry, the application volume has slowed a little bit in that part of what we do. But the market has some
influence on that. However, we see our pipelines are up. And so, Derek and I were just discussing this last week,
we compare Phase 2 of our plan with Phase 1. And so, if you look at that, we're adding about 26 RMs in Phase 2,
we added roughly 20 RMs in Phase 1. We are seeing very similar impact in the first six months of that.
Remember, it's the first six months of that. So, by the time you hire them, they take an application, you don't start
closing anything or booking anything till third and fourth quarter. And so, we see a very similar result in that period
of time. Derek, I don't know if you can show â€“ highlight kind of where we were in Phase 1 and what we grew to, so
just to give an idea [ph] and (00:39:35) the timing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. Yes. So we â€“ I think right before I started, Andy was here and then in September, our third quarter of 2021,
we rolled out Phase 1. And so, I looked at the June â€“ before that June 30th and our C&I loans were about $9.2
billion, that's $11.1 billion now. And really, you grew about a $1 billion that first year, really the back half of the first
year and then another $1 billion the following year. And we're sort of seeing the same thing, where you maintain
the portfolio you have and then as the new hires come in, the pipeline builds slowly. And then we're all eager to
see the pull-through on that and expect the same thing to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And so, Scott, if you wanted the short version versus the Reader's Digest, we're still within the forecast. We're
slightly low end of that just because auto is a little bit shorter and then CRE is a little bit down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hello.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. I'm just wondering, of the 28 planned hire or 26 planned hires, how much of that hiring has already taken
place?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. That's a great question. We are at 10 hires net, so net meaning if somebody leaves, we actually have to
replace that too. And so, we're at 10 hires of 26 hires and I expect that we'll be at 100%, my estimation target is
by the end of the first quarter of 2025, we'll be at all 26 hires.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess just maybe going back to the growth expectations for both loans and deposits in the back
end of the year, I mean, both of them imply kind of a meaningful ramp. I guess, on the loan side, and I get, RMs
coming in, bringing over their books of business, environment does seem soft, like is the expectation that CRE
paydowns slow, that auto demand intensifies? I guess, what's giving you confidence that that loan growth is going
to materialize in a more meaningful capacity in 2Q seeing as the landscape is still a little bit soft here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. We have the benefit of seeing our pipelines. And so, we're able to track kind of where they were this time
last year. We can do it by same quarter prior year and those pipelines are up. And typically when you see
pipelines grow, the loan production and loan balances follow on that. We also think that we've had â€“ we've
monitored pretty closely what we've seen in the CRE paydowns and we expect that that net number for CRE
won't be quite as negative in the second half as the first half. So, when we look across the board, the loan growth
doesn't have to be heroic. It just has to be a little bit better than it was in the first half. And frankly, those 10 people
that we have hired, we'll really start to get benefit from them in the second half of the year. So, there's additional
dollars there.
On the deposit side of it, the balance sheet, we can look at annual trends and we see the back half trend for the
company for the last two years. We have significantly improved our capabilities on the consumer side and we've
added RMs on the commercial side. And frankly, our wealth business is doing quite well on deposit acquisition.
So, both sides of the balance sheet, we feel that we'll be able to fund pretty equally, fund our loan growth in the
second half what we're looking at on the loan number and then funding it on the deposit side.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, I guess, just a corollary, a corollary on the deposit side, what's the implication for non-interest
bearing demand? How is that progressing? [ph] Is that pace of pressure line item, maybe abating (00:44:02) a
little bit? And then, just wondering if the loan growth is somewhat dependent on the deposit growth manifesting or
if that deposit growth doesn't manifest, would you continue funding that loan growth with wholesale funding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So a couple of things, I think we've talked about the last two quarters, the non-interest bearing deposits bottoming
about [ph] five-eight (00:44:28), $5.8 billion. I think it bottomed about $5.7 billion. We still have the same view and
bottoms-up forecast telling us that it's going to grow a few hundred million between now and the end of the year.
So, I think that is largely intact. One of the things â€“ and so, we have contemplated your other question, we did in
the fourth quarter, about loan growth and deposit growth. Our loan growth right now is not and strategies is not
dependent on deposit growth, but we feel confident in both of them.
We grew deposits quite a bit the second half of last year and outperformed our expectations the first quarter of
this year and a little bit of the second quarter is rebounding from that. So, we have confidence in the tactics, but
also we don't necessarily want to put the brakes on our go-to-market strategy with the commercial relationship
managers who are tasked with getting both. And what I mean by that is, when we repositioned our securities and
sold or the resi real estate and improved our profitability, but it also freed up capacity and funding, so that if loan
opportunities get ahead of the pace of deposit growth, we have flexibility there as long as it's profitable, because
the set-up for this is driving growth and profitability and that gives us the flexibility to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll tag on to that. We have to think of what our funding sources and the downside scenario of not hitting your
deposit numbers are. But make sure you understand that a majority of our growth on the deposit side, we expect
to come from consumer. We have executed on every consumer strategy that we had in the plan. Every time we've
launched a new piece of it, we've seen an improvement in retention. We've seen an improvement in customer
satisfaction, which typically leads to people staying. So, remember that growth is dependent on people staying
and adding to it.
The second part of that is you can start to see what your tactics are and seeing the households accelerate, which
we have each of the last three months, including in this month. When that starts to accelerate, they bring quality
deposits and we measure what the quality of those customers are. So, between the decreased runoff, the
improvement from even year-end [ph] in (00:46:52) customer satisfaction leading to decreased runoff and then
acquiring new customers that are starting, that are higher quality than the year before, while we do have a
contingency to fund and have loan growth regardless of deposit growth, that combined with what we've seen in
the trend the last two years, gives us the confidence that we'll be able to fund the loan growth vis-Ã -vis our deposit
growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And if I can just sneak one more question in just for the remainder kind of planned hiring, I'm just
wondering how much of that from an expense standpoint is going to be able to be mitigated with maybe further
enhancements, reductions on other expenses. You guys have done a really nice job kind of keeping the line on
15


Associated Banc-Corp

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
expenses over the last four quarters while adding new people. Is there still capabilities to maybe offset some of
the hiring spend or should we see a greater pull-through from these expected hires into the expense base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, you're making my job easier right now, because I assume our leadership team is listening and we go into
every single year saying where do we cut to invest. Those conversations have started already trying to get out in
front of that. And so, we expect we'll find areas that we can decrease expenses to invest in, where the world's
moving. Part of where the world's moving for us is to be local and add to the commercial RMs, although adding 16
people won't make or break our budget all by itself. So that is our approach to business. Of course, everyone's
battled expense growth and inflation and what that means, but that conversation has happened as recently as this
morning and meetings that I've had, as recently as yesterday with our entire FP&A team and we have meetings
already scheduled with our executive leadership team to have the same conversation. So, it is the way that we do
business. Yes. And we expect to manage our expenses in 2025 in a very similar type of fashion.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe could you start and talk about the $81 million of office CRE
loans that matured in the first half of the year in terms of updated appraisals and, if those loans remain on the
balance sheet today? And I asked the question because I think you've got another [ph] $230-million-ish (00:49:34)
set to mature in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. I would say, in terms of the first half of the year, it was definitely a mix of some we kept, if they met
underwriting criteria. We've had others that paid off via sale or refinance. So, it's probably a fairly even mix
amongst the three. And that's kind of how we would look at the rest of the year as well. Anything that stays on the
books that we're looking to renew really [ph] we've got a â€“ we're looking to reset to (00:50:08) updated
underwriting standards, et cetera and work with clients on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, page 6, a complete sense, improving the returns involves decreasing
wholesale funding sources. And I've had a couple of investors reach out to me over the last hour, and just to cite
the increase in the FHLB borrowings, which kind of goes against that slide. So, looking beyond the next couple of
16


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
quarters, where do you â€“ where would you like to see wholesale funding [ph] if (00:50:36) FHLB advances be as
a percentage of your balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. So, we include in our â€“ for the purposes of managing the firm in our definition of wholesale funding, we also
include brokered CDs. So, we generally try and keep that under 15% or below those three buckets combined.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Terry, I'd just tack on to that by saying, that's why I've emphasized that we're funding the balance sheet with
deposit growth in the second half. But to me, looking at the second quarter versus first â€“ looking at the first and
second quarter [ph] in (00:51:18) combinations is important because we're able to take steps on wholesale
funding in the first quarter when we [ph] had (00:51:23) deposits longer than we expected. So that kind of went up
and came down. Our absolute intent is to have budgets and expectations where we are growing our deposits at
the same rate as our loans. And so that's what I was trying to highlight and the expectation in the second half. If
you just simply look at that one quarter, it doesn't tell the story. That's the other reason that we tried to show from
the fourth quarter average to the second quarter average, it's pretty much flat. It's a good question. Thank you.

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes, it has. I mean, it would be a difficult story to tell if we hadn't seen that already in June heading into July as
well. And frankly, it's followed the trend and the forecast that we've had internally. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Any thoughts on what could push you to the higher end of the net interest income range? Is it as simple as
loan growth or is it something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes, it's loan growth. I think, if we saw fewer payoffs than we currently have rolled up in our forecast on CRE and
we saw the pipeline mature as the pull-through come in quicker than what we have currently got penciled in,
those would both drive it. You've seen the pipeline grow as a result of adding all these people that Andy was
talking about. But at the same time, we saw pull-through as deals booked slowed down a little, largely because of
higher rates. So that could easily reverse itself. The economy itself is strong. So we don't see that, the softening.
In terms of demand driven by GDP growth, we don't see that as a as a factor that's slowing anything down in our
markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, it's possible that lower rates could be a catalyst for some loan growth. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
It's possible or it could be the â€“ both lower rates or slower payoffs than what we've got planned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one, Andy, you cited a little softer demand in the auto dealer network. Any idea on the cause
of that? Is that just a blip or persistent? What do you think?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. No, I think the captives have tried to kind of enhance the sales of auto. And so, they have some offers out
there that are pretty â€“ that have been fairly aggressive. We absolutely won't get out of the prime/super prime
business. So, we're not going to flex on that. We like it as business for us, and it's one that actually helps [ph] the
gap (00:54:45) the attrition that we plan for on the residential real estate. So, we won't â€“ we don't need to reach
there. And the average FICO â€“ Pat, what was the average FICO in June, [ph] deals we are going to â€“ pushing like
785 or 790 (00:54:55)
