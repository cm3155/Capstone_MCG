Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President, and CEO.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer.
FNB reported first quarter net income available to common stockholders of $144.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted
common share. On an operating basis, EPS grew 54% over the first quarter of 2022. Operating pre-provision net
revenues increased 68% from the year ago quarter as we managed positive operating leverage of 21%.
The overall success of FNB's financial performance was due to the consistent execution of our previously stated
strategic initiatives. For example, we set out to diversify income and rely on various sources to maintain
performance. This quarter, FNB reported record wealth management revenue of $18 million on a linked-quarter
basis, contributing to our stable non-interesting income.
We also strive to be our customers' primary operating bank. And through our deep customer relationships and
granular deposit base, we were able to maintain stable average deposit balances. Our philosophy of maintaining
consistent and prudent underwriting standard regardless of the macroeconomic environment contributed to FNB
growing average loan 3.6% linked-quarter without compromising on asset quality. The first quarter also had
positive momentum on several key performance metrics, including return on tangible common equity of 20%,
return on average assets of 1.4%, and a tangible common equity ratio of 7.5%, one of the highest levels in
company history.
We are pleased with this quarter's results and believe it validates the aforementioned execution of our strategy,
especially our conservative and diligent balance sheet management with ample capital liquidity to withstand the
adversity in the industry and a more challenging economic environment.
The recent bank failures, however idiosyncratic in nature, have placed a spotlight on the importance of liquidity in
maintaining a diversified and granular deposit base, conservative and prudent balance sheet management, solid
capital level, and sound risk management policies and governance. These practices have always been integral to
FNB's long-term strategy and are ingrained in our enterprise risk management program, which includes regular
liquidity, stress test analysis, capital stress testing, CECL reserve model analysis, and diligent, proactive credit
modeling.
As I previously mentioned on multiple calls, we foster close relationships with our customers and remain focused
on being their primary operating bank. In addition to prioritizing high touch service, we have made strategic
investments in our digital technology, treasury management platform, and payment solution capabilities, which
enables our customer primacy. The first quarter deposit levels through the industry disruption are a testament to
the success of our focus on growing client relationships, with deposits ending the quarter at $34.2 billion, a slight
decline of 1.7% from the prior quarter, outperforming the H.8 deposit data for small and large banks.
Between March 8, when the industry volatility began in quarter-end, our deposit balances were essentially flat,
declining 0.7%, primarily due to seasonal outflows with normal wholesale and retail customer activity. Another
strength is the diversity of our deposit base throughout the different customer segments, with consumer account
balances comprising the largest segment of total deposits at 41%. The consumer segment is comprised of
approximately 1 million accounts, with the median consumer deposit balance at quarter-end around $5,000.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Additionally, since March 8, we experienced a net increase in the number of accounts across all customer
segments, positioning FNB as a benefactor as deposit inflows are restored to normal levels and customers
diversify funds between banks.
Because of the granularity in our deposit base, FNB ended the quarter with approximately 76% of deposits either
insured by the FDIC or collateralized, which exceeds the peer median for the 50 banks in the KRX bank index at
year end. If necessary, we also have available liquidity to fund up to 170% of our uninsured and non-collateralized
deposit balances as of March 31, placing FNB in a very strong liquidity position.
FNB's investment portfolio philosophy is also conservative by nature with respect to duration and risk. We
managed to an average duration of between three to five years and have historically maintained a fairly even split
between available for sale and held to maturity.
At the onset of the current banking industry disruption, FNB management activated our contingency funding
plans. Our team's response was swift and working diligently over the weekend to ensure that our board of
directors will [indiscernible] (00:07:31), employees were reassured of our stability and customer-facing personnel
began proactive client outreach [ph] with talking (00:07:40) points regarding the strength of our balance sheet,
including FNB's capital liquidity position on a relative and outright basis. In addition, we bolstered our liquidity
position by increasing cash on the balance sheet by nearly $1 billion.
Through the financial crisis, pandemic, and now the banking industry disruption, FNB has earned our customers'
trust and we promise to uphold that trust as we have positioned the company to outperform the industry in a wide
array of potential economic and industry scenarios. Credit continues to remain as one of our strengths. I'm very
pleased to once again report a solid credit position with low delinquency at 60 basis [ph] points (00:08:25).
I will now turn the call over to Gary to give more details on our asset quality and our consistent management of
credit risk. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter with our credit portfolio well positioned and
our asset quality metrics remaining near historically low levels. Our performance for the period reflects total
delinquency that ended the quarter at 60 basis points, NPLs and OREO at 38 basis points, and net charge offs at
18 basis points. Criticized loans were up moderately at 19 basis points quarter-over-quarter, although down 55
basis points year-over-year and still at historically low levels. I will cover these GAAP asset quality highlights for
the quarter in more detail, followed by some insight into our credit strategy we used to manage the loan portfolio
throughout economic cycles.
Let's now walk through our credit results. Total delinquency declined 11 basis points in the quarter, maintaining
the historically low delinquency levels seen in previous quarters. NPLs and OREO were down 1 basis point,
compared to the prior quarter, with 55% of our NPLs in a contractually current payment status. Net charge-offs for
the quarter totaled $13.2 million, or 18 basis points on an annualized basis, with 11 basis points reflecting the use
of previously established specific reserves.
Total provision expense for the quarter stood at $14.9 million, providing for loan growth and charge-offs that did
not have a previously established specific reserve. CECL-related model builds were moderate at approximately
$4 million. Our ending funded reserve increased $1.7 million in the quarter and stands at $403 million or a solid

1.32% of loans, reflecting our strong position relative to our peers. When including acquired unamortized loan
discounts, our reserve stands at 1.49% and our NPL coverage position remains strong at 356%.
We remain steadfast in our approach to consistent underwriting and managing credit risk to maintain a balanced,
well-positioned portfolio throughout economic cycles. We proactively review and stress test portfolios on an
ongoing basis, including in the current quarter where we performed an in-depth review of commercial real estate
loans maturing in 2023 and 2024. We were pleased with the outcome of that exercise and did not have any risk
rating changes, which was not unexpected as we maintain a diversified commercial real estate portfolio backed
by strong sponsors and low LTVs.
Regarding the office portfolio, delinquency remains very low at 27 basis points, and criticized loans are below
10%. Our top 25 office exposures averaged $28 million, and 43% of the loans are less than $5 million. We have
and will continue to aggressively manage this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis as part of the in-depth reviews we
regularly perform.
In closing, we had a successful quarter marked by the strength and favorable positioning of our credit portfolio as
we continue to generate diversified loan growth in attractive markets. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends
in the individual markets in our footprint and we'll continue to manage risk proactively and aggressively as part of
our core credit philosophy, which has served us well in softer economic times.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on the first quarter's financial results, provide some
color on our balance sheet management activities during the banking disruption in March, and offer guidance
updates for the remainder of 2023. First quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled $144.5
million, or $0.40 per share, with record revenue contributions, seasonally higher expenses, and continued solid
asset quality performance.
Total earning assets reached an all-time high, ending the quarter at $39.3 billion, with the $352 million quarterly
increase driven by loans and leases growing $418 million, or 5.6% annualized. Commercial loans increased $222
million, or 4.7% annualized, driven by the continued success of our strategy to grow high-quality loans across our
diverse geographic footprint. While commercial production was slightly lighter than the fourth quarter, reflecting
normal seasonality, attrition approved and loan pipeline increased sequentially after the robust loan production
last quarter.
Consumer loans increased $196 million linked-quarter, or 7.3% annualized, as growth in residential mortgages of
$292 million was partially offset by decreases in average direct home equity installment loan balances, consumer
lines of credit and indirect auto loans.
Given the high rate environment, organic growth in residential mortgage reflects customers' continued preference
for adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as the continued success of our Physicians First mortgage program, both
of which we currently keep in portfolio. Investment portfolio remains stable at $7.3 billion, with 46% classified as
available for sale. When including the fair value [ph] marks (00:15:04) in our AFS and ATM portfolios, our CET1
ratio is above the peer median calculated on the same basis and we remain well-capitalized.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Duration of our securities portfolio at March 31st is 4.5 years, and inclusive of our cash position is 3.9 years. Total
deposits ended the quarter at $34.2 billion, a decrease of $580 million linked-quarter, or 1.7%, largely due to
normal first quarter seasonality. In fact, since March 8, deposits were relatively flat, with a slight 0.7% decline due
to normal outflows from wholesale and retail customer activity. Vince mentioned earlier, our median consumer
deposit balance was $5,000 at the end of March.
When looking at the total deposit portfolio, our average account balance is approximately $30,000, which is well
below Silicon Valley Bank's average of $1.1 million and Signature Bank's $508,000. We are also lower than our
peer median as of year-end.
The deposit mix did shift this quarter, with time deposits increasing $1.1 billion, as customers moved funds out of
money market accounts to take advantage of higher CD rates. As of March 31st, our mix of non-interest-bearing
deposits remained strong at 33% of total deposits, down slightly from 34% at year-end, our loan-to-deposit ratio
remained at a comfortable level, ending the quarter below 90%.
In light of the banking industry disruption, we decided to bolster our on-balance sheet liquidity position by
increasing short- and long-term borrowings by about $1 billion in the aggregate, bringing our excess cash position
to $1.3 billion at quarter end.
Looking at the income statement, record quarterly revenue of $416 million was driven by net interest income
totaling $337 million, a linked-quarter increase of $1.8 million, or 0.5%. The net interest margin expanded 3 basis
points as the earning asset yield increased 39 basis points, with loan yields up 42 basis points, while the cost of
funds increased 38 basis points.
Prudently managing deposit costs in this rate environment continues to be a significant focus. Spot interest-
bearing deposit cost ended the quarter at [ph] $171 million (00:17:41), with the quarterly average coming in at [ph]
$150 million (00:17:45), reflecting the ongoing diligent work by our team. Total cumulative deposit betas ended
the quarter with 21.8%, within our prior guidance of 22%.
Turning to non-interest income and expense, non-interest income totaled $79.4 million, a slight decrease of 1.5%
in the fourth quarter of last year. Wealth management reached a record $18 million, with a quarterly increase of
$2.4 million, mostly split between securities, commissions and fees, driven by strong annuity revenue and [audio
gap] (00:18:22) services, primarily from strong organic growth seasonality.
Higher production and contingent revenues led to a $3.3 million, or 73% linked-quarter, increase in insurance
commissions and fees, while mortgage banking operations income increased $2.1 million linked-quarter,
reflecting a 5% increase in sold mortgage volume and improved gain on sale margins. Capital markets income
decreased $3.2 million due to reduced syndications and swap fees from very strong levels in the fourth quarter of
2022.
Service charges in the quarter decreased $2.9 million, largely reflecting the expected decline in overdraft and
non-sufficient fund charges due to our previously announced [ph] fee (00:19:11) program changes given the
current competitive environment. Operating non-interest expense totaled $218 million, an 11% increase from the
fourth quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality combined with the addition of the Union expense base for a
full quarter and the impact of the previously announced increase in the FDIC insurance assessment rate.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $17 million, of which approximately $12 million was related to normal
seasonal compensation activity, including $6.7 million of long-term compensation and seasonally higher

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
employer-paid payroll taxes. The remaining $5 million increase primarily from reduced salary deferral, given lower
loan origination volumes, and the addition of the acquired Union expense base. Even with these expense items,
the efficiency ratio remains at a favorable level of 50.6%.
Our capital ratios ended the quarter at levels that are expected to be at or above peer median. Tangible book
value per common share was $8.66 at March 31st, an increase of $0.39 per share, or 4.7%, in December 31,
largely from the higher level of earnings and the decreased impact of AOCI, which reduced the current quarter
end tangible book value by $0.87 per share, compared to $0.99 at year end. As Vince mentioned, our TCE ratio is
one of the highest in company history at 7.5%. To demonstrate the strength of this level amidst the industry
disruption, TCE adjusted for our HTM unrealized losses equals 6.9%, which is 50 basis points higher than our
peer median using recorded year-end levels.
Let's now look at 2023 financial objectives, starting with the balance sheet. On a full year spot basis, we
maintained our previous guide for loans to increase mid-single digits year-over-year. Total deposits projected to
end 2023 at a similar level as of December 31, 2022 spot balances, although we do expect a continued shift in
the deposit mix given the current rate environment. Full year net interest income is expected to be between
$1.315 billion and $1.365 billion, with the second quarter between $325 million to $335 million.
Our guidance currently assumes a 25 basis point rate hike in May and then flat for the remainder of the year. The
modest decrease in guidance from last quarter is largely related to our expectation for higher deposit betas given
the current banking industry environment. If rates were to come down this year, as the forward curve currently is
projecting, that could lead to modest upside to our NII forecast.
Full year non-interest income is expected to be between $305 million and $320 million, with a slight upward
revision reflecting our first quarter [ph] beat (00:22:25) relative to our previous guidance. Second quarter is
expected to be in the mid-$70 million range, with continued benefits from the diversified revenue strategy. Full
year guidance for non-interest expense on an operating basis is $835 million to $855 million. Adjustment has to
account for the higher first quarter expense levels, but the remaining nine months are expected to be consistent
with our prior guidance.
Second quarter non-interest expense is expected to be between $205 million to $210 million. Full year provision
guidance remains $65 million to $85 million and is dependent on net loan growth, potential CECL model related
builds from a softer macroeconomic environment. Lastly, the effective tax rate should be between 20% and 21%
for the full year, which does not include any investment tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from Frank Schiraldi of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Vince, you mentioned the negative carry or you mentioned the additional liquidity on the balance
sheet. Just wondering what the negative carry is on that. And is that a primary driver of the lower NII guide or is it
more of the mix shift? I guess you now have accelerating a bit into time it seems.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The negative carry, Frank, is really like maybe 10, 15 basis points. It's not that significant. As you know,
we're earning – our excess cash position was still at $1.3 billion where we earned $490 million on that. I think the
[ph] borrowings now (00:26:47) were around $40 million or so. It's not a big negative carry. It's just the mix shift
and stuff continuing to roll given current deposit rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just kind of curious, I don't know if you have this granularity there in front of you. But as you think
about the mix shift that's baked into your guide, what does that sort of assume in terms of noninterest-bearing
levels as a percentage of total deposits by the end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It comes down slightly between now and the end of the year. As you know, that's a big focus in the company. Our
account acquisition strategy and lending strategy has always revolved around bringing in the operating accounts
and those continued efforts continue to bring in new accounts. And during this disrupting period, we actually net
out of accounts. But as a...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I'd say we've talked about customer primacy. What we mean by that is we're the principal operating bank or
we're the disbursement bank for consumers and businesses. And if you look at the granularity in the consumer
book that we mentioned on the call, in the prepared comments, there's – that's pretty sticky. There's not a lot of

places to go to, to earn more on $5,000. I don't know that it is impactful enough for people to move their money
around. And we tend to be – that tends to be their principal operating account for us. So, they're going to keep
cash to cover items that are presented for payment and it's where direct deposit is credited into.
And then on the business side, as we've said historically, if you look at the concentration of 17% of the deposits
that we have in the commercial segment, a good bit of that is tied directly to services. So, compensating balances
where we gain an earnings credit that sits in a non-interest-bearing bucket and, again, tends to be sticky because
customers prefer using balances to pay for services versus paying cash [ph] fee (00:28:54).
So, that's all embedded into that non-interest DDA category. So, we feel pretty good about having a good solid
base, and at a minimum, we feel we'll outperform others who may be relying on more transient balances. I think it
shows basically. If you look back historically, you can see it in our performance relative to other banks in the
category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right.

Hope that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I appreciate that. Yeah. And then just lastly, as a follow-up, just a question for Gary on the – on credit. In the slide
deck, you talked about the average LTVs. I think it's in the office book specifically in the low-60s. I'm guessing, I
assume that's largely value at origination of these loans. And I'm just wondering, as you've gone through this in-
depth portfolio review, what that sort of tell you – if you can share what that's telling you about where value has
moved in some of your markets in terms of the underlying property in sort of percentage terms. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We've updated various appraisals, Frank, on properties in that space. We've seen reductions, generally
speaking, in the 15% to high-teen range, into the 20s. We did have one that had some leasing issues that got into
the 30s. But so far, at this point, that's the range that we have been experiencing and that's pretty much been
across the board with the ones that we've had to update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. I appreciate that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then, Frank, just to clarify on the negative carry question. I forgot, we had some portion of what we took down
with [ph] two-year (00:30:55) money, like $440 million kind of all in the additional liquidity, which really had no
negative carry, kind of all in on a flat basis.

Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first on the operating expense guidance. If you could just give me an
idea of what drove the overall outlook higher given – I guess, my overarching thought that with the outlook down
that that should drive a decline in incentive compensation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I can comment on that, Danny. Expenses for the quarter on an operating basis came in at $218 million. Our
range from January was $210 million to $215 million. So, $3 million above the high end of that range. Half of that
variance was just lower deferrals on loan origination costs and lower consumer volumes – consumer loan
volumes than what we had planned. So, that was kind of half of that $3 million difference. And then the rest of it
was really a handful of kind of one-time items.
If you look at our guidance for the second quarter, $205 million to $210 million, that compares to $218 million
figure. That's consistent with our original guidance that we gave in January. In fact, the nine months, as I
mentioned in my prepared remarks, is unchanged from what we had said before. So, it's really just a combination
of lower [ph] FAS 91 (00:32:30) deferrals, half of it, and then some one-time items.
So, as we move forward, depending on how the year plays out, there is commission, incentive comps and
variable. Depending on how much revenue we create, that'll be up or down. So, that is a swing item or a variable
expense that will vary depending on [indiscernible] (00:32:49) ultimately. But it's really just – it was $3 million
above the high end of the range. So, it's not that significant and the guidance forward, we'll manage expenses
diligently as we always have.

I appreciate that. Sorry, I missed the – your comment in the prepared remarks on the stable from prior guidance
for the rest of the year, but thanks for that. And then maybe a couple for Gary here on credit. First, the office
portfolio. Appreciate all the incremental detail there. Just wondering if you had a breakdown of – I know you
mentioned it's spread across the footprint, but what properties are in what cities, or urban versus suburban? Any
way that we could get more detail into kind of the type of city that those offices are in?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Well, I mean, the majority of the larger office facilities are in the metro cities, Daniel. As mentioned in the remarks,
I mean, 43%, almost half of that book, is under $5 million. So they're kind of scattered in suburban markets for the
most part. But in terms of those appraisals, we had one with leasing issues in Pittsburgh that came down. We had
one in the Carolinas that came down. So, it's pretty much across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Gary, Just to clarify, like you said, the majority, vast majority of our CRE exposure is suburban in nature. I know
you said metro markets, but we cannot finance on a long-term basis large office facilities other than our own. But I
mean, we don't – we're not in that business, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. With the average being $28 million, I mean, that kind of speaks to the top 25, the $28 million speaks to the
type of properties and locations. We have very little urban, big city center type of office properties. Very little.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And our LTVs are very conservative. I think a portion of the portfolio that's in construction fund up basically,
typically secured by leases. So, we don't do a lot of spec or hardly any. So, that's backed up by leases. And the
LTVs are going to be a little higher on the construction pieces of the portfolio versus what we have in our book,
because we tend not to keep large exposures. We underwrite them to permanent take-out. So I just want to make
sure everybody understands that the make-up of the numbers on the slide that we presented are for non-owner
occupied CRE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Daniel Tamayo Q

And lastly, just a follow-up there on – not on office, but in, I guess, the macro outlook overall. The reserves came
down in the quarter, which was a little bit surprising. But just curious on your thoughts on the driver there of
reserves down and then your thoughts on the overall macro outlook, I guess, relative to last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Actually, dollar reserves were not down and the reserve was down from 1.33% to 1.32%, so it was down 1
basis point, still at $403 million. And we use some specific reserves that I mentioned in the prepared remarks in
terms of that 1 basis point. So, we look at it as flattish and when you include the unamortized loan discounts at
$149 million, I mean, our reserve position compared to peers is very strong.

Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe just continuing the last line of questioning on
the allowance ratio. I mean, to your point, it is quite elevated compared to peers. I guess how much of a pending
recession reserve is already embedded in your numbers? And I guess if we do end up in a more punitive macro
environment, does that 25 basis point buffer kind of hold true as the rest of the group catches up or some of that
already embedded in your more cautious starting point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Timur, we've taken a cautious position ever since we got into – six months into COVID. We felt very
strongly that it was going to be an issue for quite some time. We did not release reserves as other institutions did
during that timeframe in large sums. And we looked at it from a standpoint that we wanted to maintain those
reserves based on what we saw coming down the road. And then we get into what appears to be naturally a
softer economic timeframe.
So, we've been able to maintain those reserves. They're well within our ranges of being quantitative versus
qualitative. And it's an analysis that we go through each and every month. Actually, we re-run the reserve every
week based on the changes in the portfolio week-to-week. So, when you look at that position, we feel good about
where we are and we're going to continue to manage it accordingly.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, Gary, one more for you, just following up on the line of questioning regarding the office
book. I guess for the – you laid out 13% maturity in 2023, 11% in 2024. I guess for those loans that are coming up
for kind of maturity or refi cycle, what's the new rate that they would be rolling into? And I guess what's the
confidence on kind of the underlying occupancy and underlying trends that there is the ability to absorb the higher
interest rate that they'd be rolling into?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We just did a deep dive on every single one of those larger credits during the quarter and we had no
downgrades, as I mentioned in the remarks, around those credits. We manage them on a regular basis on a loan-
by-loan basis. And so, that most recent review, which reflected no downgrades, took into consideration those
maturity walls and the ability to reset generally in the 7% range.
So, we've got that built into those particular situations. I'll also mention that LTVs generally in the 60s, naturally
some of that's going to take a hit when you have some leases roll out. But the sponsorship is extremely strong
across that book. And we feel that it's very manageable based on the most recent review, which reflected no
downgrades, as I mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Gary. Gary, the question that came up about our reserves relative to peers. I think it's helpful to mention that
our criticizing classified loan ratios are typically higher than the other banks because of our aggressive gradation.
It doesn't necessarily translate into net charge-offs. So, if you look at over a long period of time, FNB versus the
peers, we tend to run higher but then have lower charge-offs throughout the cycle. That's a function of our credit
people being very aggressive and proactive in downgrading credit, which results in a higher reserve position.
So, the gradation really matters within the portfolio. Other institutions could delay or have delays in their
assessment of risk, and they won't see the same level of reserves until the very tail end of a crisis. So, it should
be viewed as a positive, not a negative. I just want to make sure everybody understands that.
[indiscernible] (00:42:48), Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I would agree with everything you said there, Vince. I mean, we're very aggressive around the management
of risk ratings, As you mentioned, and this portfolio is front and center for certain, and it has been for quite some
time.

Scott Free A
Executive Vice President & Treasurer, F.N.B. Corporation
Sure. This is Scott Free, the Treasurer. The inverted yield curve has kind of created a unique circumstance where
with the deposit rates finally moving up, the down scenario now will start to get [indiscernible] (00:43:47) moving
those balance a little faster than [indiscernible] (00:43:50).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just last for me, any thoughts around the buyback? The banks are kind of all over the place
in terms of continuing it, pausing it. You guys are active in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can give any
color as to what was repurchased kind of subsequent to March 8 and then what the outlook is for the buyback
going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I'd like to start out by saying if you look at our capital position relative to others, we stand out because of the
limited AOCI impairment and conservative management of our investment portfolio [indiscernible] (00:44:30)
who's sitting there with us. So, I think that puts us in a different position. We're already CET1. We're already –
we're bargaining, so we expect capital appreciation to continue to advance those capital ratios. That gives us a
little bit more flexibility than others.
Having said that, we're still very cautious because of the environment that we're in. I'm not quite sure how things
play out throughout the rest of the year. I'm a little bit cautious because I feel that we are headed into a
recessionary period and we're seeing some slowing down in the economy in various sectors. So, we're getting
mixed signals. But because of that, we're going to proceed very cautiously. But we do have the capacity to do it if
we desire to do so and if it's beneficial to the shareholders.
So, Vince, I don't know if you want to add any color to that, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, I would just say, I mean, the 10% target that we've talked about we still think is very appropriate given
the risk profile of the balance sheet. So, as we move forward with do, as Vince said, expect that to kind of
gradually build from here. We have capacity. I mean, we'll be thoughtful about repurchasing. We purchased in the
[ph] 13th (00:45:48). If we get comfortable with the environment, we'd like to be repurchasing in the [ph] 11th
(00:45:53), obviously. So, I think there's definitely interest in having some of that deployed as we go through the
year. It's just going to be kind of a matter of when.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And just to confirm, none of the fourth quarter repurchase activity happened when the market disruption started,
well before that, right? But I will say, again, we're in a different position than others, fortunately. So, we have
options and we'll be very careful about how we execute those options. But we do have the capacity to do it, others
do not. That's why you're getting mixed responses.

The only other thing I would add, Timur, too, is on the asset sensitivity, just to add to what Scott was saying. If you
look at the numbers, it's very close to neutral. The numbers, plus or minus, are not significant like they may have
been 9 or 12 months ago. So, you get that slight benefit, whether it's a plus or minus, but you're kind of starting to
triangulate around kind of neutral position there.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
You guys have hit most of it. I guess just one kind of bigger picture question around loan growth here. I guess,
what – you guys have talked a lot about the credit side, but I guess what about in terms of the funding side? I
mean, is there scenario that that could impact your appetite for incremental loan growth here?
I mean, obviously, I think in response to recent events, the CD growth kind of across the industry has surged. I
would imagine that will continue to a certain extent, maybe not quite as severely as it did over the last 30 days of
the quarter. But is there a scenario where the funding, if it sustains at kind of like the current beta increase and
higher cost [ph] CDDs (00:47:57) where that could impact your appetite to book new loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think our guidance is pretty conservative for us, given the markets that we're in. And if you look at our
deposit base and our liquidity position, the mix of our deposits, we have a lot of avenues to drive liquidity. That still
creates a scenario where it's accretive to book loans. So, I don't think we're going to be impacted like others might
be. I'm not suggesting. I think you're spot on across the industry, but that's what differentiates us again. Our
conservative nature, the fact that the company's been positioned with the deposit base that it has and our
conservative credit underwriting standards gives us the ability to continue to lend through the cycle very
selectively.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
So, while demand may fall off, there'll be fewer players out there looking to originate. I think the last cycle we went
through, we saw it. So, we may have an opportunity to increase share in the markets that we've expanded into
relative to a number of competitors. I don't see us in a position where we have to pull back. And I've told our
employees that they should be very happy that they work here, particularly if you're in the lending business.
So, while it's difficult during good times, because we tend to be a little more conservative, our ability to sustain our
lending activity through the cycle is real, and Gary's philosophy about credit is real. So, we stay within a narrow
band and we don't try to outgrow ourselves during frothy times and take on undue risk. And during times like this,
we're in the market supporting our clients and growing share. I think that's utopia for commercial banker. I
wouldn't say that's the case for everyone. As you look across the broad spectrum of banks, everyone's in a
different position. But FNB is in a very sound position relative to achieving our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's helpful, Vince. Thanks. And then not to put the cart in front of the horse here, but just as you guys think
about that relative strength and we get through these next couple of quarters and maybe hopefully finally get a
better idea of whether we're going into a recession or maybe things stabilize, what have you, I mean, how does
that translate to – I mean, I think one of the reasons that you guys are in this position is just because of the
diversity of the franchise line of business. You've got geography. M&A obviously historically has been a big part of
achieving that diversity and then there's dislocation. You guys are kind of strongly positioned here. I mean, what
type of opportunities longer term do you think could stem from – for FNB from all this dislocation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I certainly think the industry is going to change. I think the landscape is going to change because of what's
gone on. There will be pressure on others. As we move through this cycle, we're going to stay very focused on
managing risk, making sure we have ample liquidity, pricing our funding appropriately, not worrying too much
about growth, worrying more about margin as we move through this portion of this economic cycle. But I do think
that there will be opportunities on the other end of it. I don't know what they are. I will tell you, though, that we've
also done a terrific job, our team done a great job of building businesses from the ground up.
So if you look at our non-interest income, which performed pretty well this year and reflecting on the prepared
comments, Vince mentioned the wealth management business, we've had good success in insurance, we have a
very granular, diversified group of businesses that generate the income from the company, and that's largely been
grown organic. So, we'll continue to focus on building out our capabilities within those groups to derive fee
income, which is an annuity benefit to the earnings.
And then, we're going to stay focused on our digital strategy. I think the award that we received for the eStore was
fairly substantial where large, large – the largest banks in the world applied to be recognized and we were
selected. So, our strategy is different. We are very focused on continuing to add features to that and continuing to
penetrate the customer base that we have and the prospects that we have in the seven states that we operate in,
which are pretty good states to be in. So I think that's the focus as we move forward.
And I've already gone over our M&A strategy. We've talked about it before. But I think for now, we're just pausing
and we're going to wait to see what shakes out. I think we will come through this in a position of strength. So we'll
have plenty of opportunities [indiscernible] (00:52:59).

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So I mean, we've been managing that cash position fluidly over the last 1.5 year or so. I would say that we took
down quite [audio gap] (00:53:49) billion dollars or so of liquidity when we brought in liquidity, just given the
uncertainty in the environment and just given our conservative nature.
So, that was $1 billion we wouldn't have otherwise taken. So we thought that was the smart thing to do and
conservative thing to do in this environment. And when we look at what we put on, so our total wholesale funding
today, about $3 billion, about a third of it is two years, a third is one year and the other third is inside of six

months. So kind of put a ladder together and we use that kind of over time to kind of fund what we [indiscernible]

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
That's helpful, Vince. Thank you. And then just a follow-up to the NII guide. You mentioned the slight step-down
due to higher deposit beta assumptions. Have you guys quantified what you think the deposit beta through the
cycle will be? Has that increased? Can you put a target on the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, we have our quarterly target in the slides. I would say that so far, just to remind everybody, as we have
on the slide, our cumulative beta for total deposits was 21.8% at the end of the quarter. We had guided to 22%,
so pretty close to that, and it was, remember, 16.3% at the end of the year. So, as we look ahead, we're
projecting kind of mid-20s total deposit betas at the end of the second quarter. And while the end of the year feels
very far away, I mean, our current thoughts, and I'll call them thoughts for year one, would be kind of low-30s for
total deposits as far as the cumulative beta through the end of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
That's great. Okay, Vince, I appreciate that. Last one for me. Gary, you guys have been conservative and
derisked the portfolio in a couple of ways over the past two to three years. Do you see any opportunity or appetite
for further derisking as you look out into the environment ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
As we look at the portfolio today, Russell, naturally, there are softer economic times ahead. We're not looking at
any significant derisking at all at the moment because we're pleased with the position of the portfolio. But
naturally, we're extremely cautious on the office sector, as we have been for quite some time now. And we
continue to review that book on a loan by loan basis. So, we'll, in the normal course of business potentially move
an asset or two or small segment of them. But we have nothing teed up at this point.

with the steps you talked about a little bit about liquidity, just kind of what's the starting point, if you will, for next
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The March margin, Brian, was $349 million kind of our entry point into the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And just kind of the puts and takes from here, I guess, as you look into 2Q, kind of what the guide
you've given?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I guess, one thing, too, to point out that's important is with the excess cash that we have, the additional liquidity
that we grabbed, the $1 billion, that obviously affects that ratio, right? So, the net interest income comes down a
little bit. The ratio gets affected by that kind of excess liquidity position of what was there. I'm sorry, say, what was
your second question again, Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. No, I was just saying just to kind of think about that margin, the stepping point into the next quarter. $349
million is kind of the starting point. Just is it tied to the guidance? Is your expectation that that margin percentage
is relatively flat from here or just – I know you talked about with rates being down, you could see a little bit of a
benefit, but just near-term in the next quarter or two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think [indiscernible] (00:58:18) net interest income, I mean, it comes down a little bit from here and then
we build into the third and fourth quarter kind of given our earning asset growth as we move into the third and
fourth quarter. I mean, the margins fluctuates a lot and with the noise in the balance sheet, it's just harder to talk
to the margin piece, Brian, but the net interest income...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yes.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Okay. And as far as just that excess liquidity, Vince, I mean, what's the plan? I guess, how long do you plan – I
guess, do you just plan to keep that for a bit while some of it exit or just how are you thinking about that, Vince?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, that's what I was saying, a third of it is kind of six months or less, and then a third is one year, a third is two
years. So we just let that – we're not going to prepay it. Just let that naturally kind of get absorbed as it meets with
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. I missed that part. So, all right. And then just the pipelines – the loan pipelines in the quarter, I
missed what you guys said there on the commercial side. Maybe it was Vince as far as where they're at or just
kind of how they're trending here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think the pipelines are a little softer than they've been historically at the same time. I don't think that we're
out as aggressively knocking on doors and I think that the demand has fallen off a little bit kind of unilaterally kind
of across the board. I will tell you that the short-term pipelines look pretty decent. Our 90 days – we measure at
90 days and then beyond that. Beyond 90 days looks a little softer. The 90-day pipeline looks a little more solid.
There's a higher percentage of funding coming through in that pipeline, which means there's less junk ending up
and people are a little more focused.
So, it's a mixed bag as I've looked across all of the markets. Some of the markets in Carolina are down. Some
have better pipelines. South Carolina looks pretty good. Charlotte looks good short term and is probably building
their long-term pipeline. Cleveland and Pittsburgh are doing okay. So, it's kind of all over the board, which tells me
there's a lot of caution out there in the customer base. So, it's not us. It's not due to a lack of effort on the calling
side. I think it's more about what the client is doing and there's less demand from our existing customers for
CapEx spend at this stage in the cycle, which is probably a good thing, right? So, a little more caution in the
portfolio.
What we're also seeing is utilization rates are flat. No one asked that questions [ph] or offer them (01:00:58). I
think, basically, as we look at the C&I book, and, Gary, you can chime in if you like to, but I think a lot of our
customers have not been building inventories. They've actually been leaving inventory and moving their short-
term assets to cash as we move into a slower economic period. So, we're starting to see reductions in loan
balances. And I think after the disruption that occurred in the banking industry, a number of companies, it gave
them a heightened awareness about where they are and they took cash and basically paid down revolver debt
because they're paying a much higher interest rate than they're receiving. So, a lot of that's going on over the last
few months, and it's a little hard to forecast out through the end of the year, but I would expect us to be more in
line with our guide. But it's going to be a fight to get there, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would...

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would agree with the customer's position on managing inventory downward. We're pretty much seeing that
across the board. Naturally, they built up some inventory during the supply chain issues. They've moved through
some of that and with caution ahead from an economic standpoint and then potentially slowed down there. They
are very focused on their inventory positions. And I would expect that to continue to move down as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Perfect. Thank you for all the color. And just on the new origination yields, just I don't know if Gary or whomever,
but just kind of where are those at today on the loan front?
[indiscernible] (01:02:54)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sorry, Gary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead, Vince. You got the specific numbers. I mean, I have generalities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I can make a high level comment, Gary, and then any color you want to add. The new balance made during the
first quarter came on at $631 million. But for comparison, that was $570 million in the fourth quarter and that's
total, total new loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Perfect. And maybe, Gary, just you mentioned earlier on the call just the criticized level, did you
say that that was up modestly in the quarter? I think you said down year-over-year or do I have that wrong as far
as what's criticized assets did?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It was up 19 basis points, quarter-over-quarter, Brian, down 55 basis points on a year-over-year basis with a $5
billion larger balance sheet. So, they're at near low record levels from a criticized standpoint still today.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Okay. And just the increase, was there anything specific that kind of drove the increase or is it just a lot of things
in there? Just anything you would point to given all the things you've – all the disclosures you've added on credit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, not really. It was it was kind of just general.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Nothing specific.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And just the last one for me was on the capital markets revenue. I think you talked about
syndications being a little bit lower. Just any thoughts on just how that – I guess, the expectation would be that
you see a little bit of volatility in that, but it should trend higher as you go throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think if you look at how we performed this quarter, it's pretty consistent with a less robust – it's kind of
more baseline performance, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, I think that will all depends on how everything shakes out as we move forward. I mean, obviously, on the
structural side of syndications, if we're [ph] leading and less leading (01:05:01), it's going to depend on CapEx
need, M&A activity. There's a bunch of factors that go into driving fee income in that category. I would expect
some things to come up over the next few quarters that will benefit that area because we do have a fairly
significant calling effort [audio gap] (01:05:21) syndication side.
And then I would also expect derivatives, as we move through the cycle and you see a number of companies
burned through their own fixed rate program, I would expect to see them re-upping, particularly with the inversion
in the yield curve. So, I mean, there's hope that we can sustain or grow those numbers. I think that's reflected in
our guide. So, I actually thought they did pretty well in the first quarter, which is typically seasonally lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[indiscernible] (01:05:56) I think we're good. From a wealth perspective, we're doing extraordinarily well,
producing net asset values and growing net asset values, supplying the Southeast, in particular in intermittent
lending. So, I would expect that to continue because we [ph] beat up (01:06:16) staffing down there over the last
few years and have better penetration. So, I'm expecting that to do a little better than previous years in terms of
organic growth that should help us in the long run.
And then mortgage, there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're headed from a gain on sale perspective
because of where rates are, but, again, we were new to many of the markets. We have great people, great
originators, and we're spread across a pretty vast geography with diversification, with lower relative share in many
markets. So, we should be able to sustain that. So, we feel pretty good about our guide in that [indiscernible]
(01:07:04).
