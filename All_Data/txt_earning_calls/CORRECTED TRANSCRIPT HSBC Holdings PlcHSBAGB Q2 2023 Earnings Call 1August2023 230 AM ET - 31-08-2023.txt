Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon to everyone in the room here in Hong Kong. Thank you for joining us,
and great to see you again. And good morning to everyone watching from London and elsewhere. Before George
takes you through the second quarter numbers, I'll start with a summary of the first half performance and
progress. First, I show this slide every quarter. It's critical in that it summarizes our strategy and our strategy
remains unchanged. It is summarized by the four pillars at the bottom of the slide. Let me take you through the
latest outcomes of that strategy. We had a good first six months. I'm pleased with the broad-based profit and
revenue generated by our global businesses and geographies. I'm also pleased with our strong capital generation
and returns. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4%, including the two material notable
items reported in the first quarter, or 18.5%, if you exclude those notable items. And we've announced a second
interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a second share buyback of up to $2 billion.
Today, we're also upgrading our guidance. Now, we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity in the mid-teens
for 2023 and 2024. Prior to 2023, we were very focused on transforming the business. Now, while still continuing
to improve operational efficiency, we are very focused on driving growth, diversifying revenue and creating
incremental value. We have a plan built around six areas. I will take you through some of these over the next few
slides. Starting with our international connectivity. We grew wholesale cross-border client business in the first half
by around 50%, with growth across all regions driven by higher rates. Our international proposition in Wealth and
Personal Banking continues to gain traction. We now have 6.3 million international WPB customers, and that is up
500,000 or 8% over the last 12 months. That's significant because these international customers generate around
2.5 times the average customer revenue.
Finally, we drove strong revenue growth in transaction banking which was up 63%. There were good
performances in Foreign Exchange and in Global Payments Solutions. Trade was slightly down year-on-year, in
line with global trade volumes. But trade balances stabilized in the second quarter, particularly in Asia. And HSBC
was named Best Bank for Trade Finance by Euromoney for the second year in a row as well as Best Bank in
Asia. The next slide sets out our latest progress on another area of focus, the redeployment of capital from less
strategic or low-connectivity businesses into higher-growth international opportunities. I'm pleased that we agreed
new terms for the sale of our French retail banking operations in the quarter. The deal is subject to regulatory

approval and we now have a lot of work to do to complete migration in early 2024. The sale of our banking
operations in Canada remains on track to complete in early 2024, with a special dividend of $0.21 per share
planned thereafter.
We completed the disposal of our Greek business last weekend and we've announced the disposal of our
Russian operations. We are changing the nature of our business in Oman and we will wind down our WPB
operations in New Zealand. Crucially, this is allowing us to target growth opportunities, some of which are set out
on the right-hand side. The first is the continued development of our wealth business across the whole of Asia.
Our digitally-enabled wealth and insurance business in Mainland China now has 1,400 wealth planners and is
driving good new business growth. We launched Global Private Banking in India last month. In June, we launched
HSBC Innovation Banking, a strengthened, globally-connected proposition on the back of our purchase of SVB
UK. We will nurture the specialism that we acquired, back it with HSBC's balance sheet strength and global
network, and build further Innovation Banking businesses in the US, here in Hong Kong, and Israel. The process
is already well underway and will enable us to support our clients in the technology and life sciences sectors to
achieve their global ambitions.
Finally, we've announced today that we are also increasing our shareholding in Tradeshift and have agreed to
launch a jointly-owned business in early 2024 to provide embedded financing solutions within their trade
ecosystem. We believe this will help us to grow our client base in Commercial Banking, giving us a new avenue
for growth outside of traditional relationship banking. The next slide looks at how we are diversifying revenue by
growing fee income and collaboration. As I've said, our wealth strategy continues to gather momentum, especially
in Asia. Net-new invested assets were down in the rest of the world due to lower third-party asset management
liquidity products, mainly in the US, but they were up in Asia by 21% to $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, we
took in a total of $75 billion of net-new invested assets and grew our invested assets by 8% globally. This all
underlines the growth potential of our wealth business. Fee income in Commercial Banking was up 6% in the first
half and collaboration revenues between our global businesses were up 5%. Collaboration revenue is particularly
important in a relatively low-growth economic environment because we can drive growth from within the
organization.
The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline we've maintained and how it enables us to invest in the bank of
the future. We remain committed to disciplined cost management and have continued to use cost savings to
increase investment in digitization. We increased spending on technology by 12.8% in the first half, and this
spending now accounts for 23% of our target base operating expenses. This investment has translated into faster
services, reduced friction, and more competitive products, all of which will improve the customer experience and
our operational efficiency. We've made good progress increasing digital penetration amongst personal and
business customers while increasing our product release frequency. Investing in technology is also enhancing our
capabilities. We now have a range of test-and-learn use cases for generative AI across HSBC and are in the
process of scaling up a small number of those. Last month, we became the first bank to join BT and Toshiba's
quantum-secured metro network.
This uses quantum technology for secure transmission of data which should mitigate the risk of future cyber
threats. And we are pleased to be working with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on two pilots to test the e-HKD
in a new payments ecosystem and to trial tokenized deposits. My last slide shows how we've continued to build
on our position as an enabler of the net zero transition. In the first half, we provided and facilitated $45 billion of
sustainable finance and investments as we continue to work closely with our clients on their transition plans. This
consisted of capital markets financing and on-balance sheet lending to clients, and included a number of key
deals in Asia and the Middle East. We were recently named Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia by
Euromoney for the sixth consecutive year.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
I'll now hand over to George to take you through the Q2 numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to everyone in the room with us today. It is great to be back here in Hong
Kong to deliver our interim results. And for those of you watching today from London and across the globe, a very
good morning and thank you for joining us. We've announced a good set of second quarter results. Reported
profits before tax were at $8.8 billion, up 89% on last year's second quarter. Revenue was up 38% at $16.7 billion.
This was driven by first, NII of $9.3 billion, which was up $2.5 billion or 38% year-on-year, and second, non-NII of
$7.4 billion, which was up $2.1 billion or 39% year-on-year. We booked expected credit losses of $0.9 billion in
the quarter. Despite the inflationary environment, cost growth in the quarter was restricted to 1% compared to last
year's second quarter, including $0.2 billion of severance costs. These severance costs were expected and we
are on track to meet our 2023 cost target to limit cost growth to around 3% on our target cost basis. Compared to
the first quarter, lending and deposits were both down 1% due to subdued loan demand, deposit outflows in
Global Banking and Markets in Europe, and the reclassification of our portfolio in Oman to held-for-sale.
Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 14.7%. As Noel said, we announced a second interim dividend of $0.10 per
share and a second share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete in around three months. TNAV
per share was down $0.24 due primarily to the final interim dividend for 2022 and the first interim dividend for
2023. The next slide shows another strong quarterly revenue performance with overall growth of 38% compared
to the second quarter of 2022. Three further points on this. As Noel mentioned, revenue was up in all three global
businesses. Wealth was up 19% due to higher rates and the strong insurance performing – performance mainly
here in Hong Kong and three across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, Global Payment
Services (sic) [Global Payments Solutions] (00:13:44) reported revenues of around $4.2 billion, an increase of
115% on the second quarter of 2022. On the next slide, reported net interest income was $9.3 billion, up $0.3
billion or 4% on the first quarter. We have introduced Banking NII as a new disclosure this quarter.
It is derived by adjusting Reported NII for the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities and the NII
generated by the Insurance business. At $11.6 billion, Banking NII was up $1.3 billion on the first quarter and up
$4.5 billion on last year's second quarter. The $2.4 billion centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities
within Global Banking and Markets in the second quarter included a $0.4-billion year-to-date impact of
methodology changes. As a reminder, the related income associated with these funding costs is reported with
non-NII. The net interest margin was 172 basis points, up 3 basis points from the first quarter of 2023 and up 43
basis points on the second quarter of 2022. We continue our structural hedging activity. Our NII sensitivity is $2.6
billion for a 100-basis point drop in rate against a previous year-end sensitivity of $4 billion. At this point, we are
adjusting our NII guidance. We now expect NII of at least $35 billion in 2023.
Within this, we expect the centrally allocated cost to funding trading activities within Global Banking and Markets
to be in excess of $7 billion, with associated income reported in non-NII. We continue to reiterate that we expect
to see higher pass-through rates and continued migration to turn – to time deposits and we remain cautious on
loan growth over the next 6 to 12 months, but we do expect it to start picking up sometime in 2024. I know that
many of you will have questions about Banking NII, in particular, which I'll be very happy to address as we move
into Q&A later on. Moving on, non-NII of $7.4 billion was down on the first quarter, which benefited from $3.7
billion of notable items and FX translation. However, it was up $2.1 billion or 39% on the second quarter of 2022.
A couple of things to mention here. One, there was a strong Wealth performance, up $0.3 billion or 19% on the
second quarter of last year, $0.2 billion of which came from increased life insurance income primarily in Hong

Kong; and two, Markets and Securities Services was down due to lower client activity and the methodology
change that I just mentioned earlier.
Fees were up $0.1 billion on the second quarter of 2022 due to higher Personal Banking and Commercial
Banking fees. Turning now to credit. Our second quarter ECL charge was $0.9 billion, which was $0.5 billion up
on the second quarter last year. It includes $0.3 billion for our Mainland China commercial real estate exposure
booked in Hong Kong, and the $0.3-billion charge for the UK. To remind you, this is a more normalized level of
charge that we expect for this year and is a sign that our main credit indicators are holding up. On the basis of
what we have seen so far in 2023 and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to expect a 2023 ECL
charge of around 40 basis points of average gross customer lending, including held for sale balances. The next
slide is our six-monthly update on our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. As before, our principal
area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. At the full year, our exposure was $9.4 billion. It now
stands at $8.1 billion due primarily to repayments.
The proportion of substandard and credit impaired exposures is around 65% of the portfolio, marginally up from
the full year. Of these $5.2 billion of exposures that we rate as substandard or credit impaired, $1.1 billion is
secured with minimal ECL due to the [ph] securities head (00:19:07). Against the remaining $4.1 billion, we have
increased our provisions from $1.7 billion at the full year to $1.9 billion today. Within this, our coverage ratio
against the unsecured credit impaired exposures has increased from around 55% to nearly 70%. At the end of
2022, we calculated a plausible downside scenario of $1 billion on this portfolio. As you can see, we have now
crystalized some of that downside into the P&L. We remain comfortable with our coverage level. On slide 17,
despite the inflationary environment, cost growth was restricted to 1% on a constant currency basis versus the
second quarter last year. As you can see, a large share of this growth was technology related.
There was also a higher performance-related pay accrual and the expected severance costs, which were part
offset by a write-back of software and lease impairments. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to around
3% in 2023 on our cost target basis. On this target basis, second quarter costs were up 6% year-on-year, of
which, around half was the $0.2 billion of expected severance costs. As a reminder, our cost target basis exclude
notable items from constant currency operating expenses. It also excludes the impact of retranslating
hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. And finally, it excludes the acquired cost base and additional
investments in HSBC Innovation Banking, which are expected to result in incremental growth of around 1%,
above our targeted basis. The full cost target basis reconciliation will be on slide 26 of this deck. Our CET1 ratio
was 14.7%, which was stable on the previous quarter. Profit generation was offset by the dividend accrual of $6.9
billion during the first half and the share buyback of $2 billion that is now completed.
So, in summary, this was another good quarter. There were good profit and net interest income performances.
Credit remains resilient. We are on track to limit cost growth in 2023 to 3% on our cost target basis. We now
expect NII of at least $35 billion in 2023. And as Noel said, we now expect a mid-teens return on tangible equity in
2023 and in 2024, excluding the sale – the upcoming sale of Canada. Finally, we are returning capital to
shareholders by way of increased dividends and share buybacks.
And with that, I'll ask Richard, if he can open it up for questions. Richard, please. Thank you.

With that, operator, can we take our first question from Manus Costello please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. O'Connor. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from today is from Manus Costello
from Autonomous. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I needed to ask about NII, please, a couple of questions. Firstly, I
noted that when NIM was flat in Asia in H1 quarter-on-quarter, could you give us a bit more color around
[indiscernible] (00:23:50) what you would expect into Q3. I appreciate the change in the cost [indiscernible]
(00:23:55) were allocated there, but I would still [indiscernible] (00:23:57) were actually some benefits from prior
[indiscernible] (00:24:01) a little bit more. And then secondly, you've also talked about increasing hedging and the
structural hedge in order to reduce your downside risk on NII. Can you give us a bit more detail on what you've
done and how to think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into 2024 and beyond? Thank you
very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Manus. George, do you want to pick up both of those points, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thanks, Noel. Thank you, Manus. So, on NIM/NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates
has translated into an uplift in the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in in that
space. We've introduced Banking NII, in due course, we will enhance our disclosure in the space to introduce
Banking NII sensitivity and banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an – such an uplift. The – with regards to
your second question, Manus, the hedging activity. So, if you look at our NII sensitivity downwards, 100 basis
point have reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About one-third of that reduction is due to our hedging structure
and hedging activity, and another one-third of that reduction would be the effect of the change of the composition
of our balance sheet. And then the last one-third is numerous other factors, including modelling enhancements.
If you now look at our structural hedging activity which we've conducted over the last 12 months, the overall
impact on the reduction of Banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Georges. Georges, you just want to explain why there's been more of a move into the sort of the non-
NII trading book?

Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.

Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
What the route – the underlying cause of that is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. So, what – due to the somewhat subdued loan growth in Asia, we have – the management of Asia has
taken the decision to allocate more funding towards supporting some of the trading activities. So, the overall
funding of our trading books globally, which heavily used also in Asia, moved from about $108 billion, or circa 6%
of our deposit base, to around $130 billion or about 9% – 8%, 9% of our deposit base. That additional lending, or
that additional transition from funds have moved NII into non-NII income. It is still rate-sensitive and it does benefit
from improved level of rates, you know, particularly in dollars where it's coming from.

Richard O'Connor A

Thank you. Next question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Aman Rakkar from Barclays. Your line is open.

Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, Noel...

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
...good morning, George. Good morning, Richard. I – morning. I have two questions, please. So, again, on net
interest income. At face value, your greater than $35 billion NII guide does imply step-ups in the run rate with net
interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you'd point us to the greater than $35 billion suggesting that there's some
conservatism baked in there. But can you talk to what the pressures are, or [indiscernible] (00:27:46) actually
even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end? Will – I think one
thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this
year. So, anything you can give us there? I guess relatedly, I note that the UK has been very strong as well, so
any kind of color you can give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the UK
would be great.
Second question was around distributions, specifically around your dividend. You're reiterating your 50% payout
ratio guidance this year and potentially next year. It does look like it's going to be quite strong earnings. I guess, if
I take consensus looking for an underlying EPS of around $1.20, which implies an ordinary dividend of $0.60, I
mean, that number feels big, big versus $0.51 you used to speak versus what you did last year. And I guess the
question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now which might then become quite
difficult to sustain in the future if rates come off and earnings kind of taper? Are you bothered that you do $0.60
this year and you do some number that's lower than that next year or thereafter? Thank you very much.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
George, you want to certainly take the NII one first and just clarification on that and then we'll come to
distributions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thank you, Armando (sic) [Aman] (00:29:32). So, kind of in turn, addressing your points, first, as you did
say, we're emphasizing that this is a floor. We're emphasizing this is a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We're
revising this floor because we gained more comfort halfway into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want
to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious, given the difficulty to forecast some of the
challenges I'll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking
to change the consensus for H2 NII. We're comfortable where H2 NII consensus stands at this stage. Now, in
terms of the pressure and the support we're seeing, well, we're seeing certainly tailwinds that we've seen already
in Q2. One, in terms of additional rate hikes to be expected very much in the major currencies such as dollar,
pounds, and euro.
We've seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalization; we've seen about 1% quarter-on-quarter normalization of
HIBOR. And if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalization. HIBOR is now around 5%, so probably
at the end of July will have fully normalized and those will provide us certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2.
This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we've been calling out from the year-end, and they will
continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth.
Certainly, subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated we may see some resumption in 2024, but
for this half – for the next half year would probably remain as a headwind. And naturally, the other headwind that
is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs behavior, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the
impact of lagged migration to time deposits. In Hong Kong, we're still assuming a 1% migration per month; and
whether this manifests as it is, it is very difficult to forecast hence our cautiousness.
Now, if I look forward, look, we're not guiding for NII in 2024, but there are a few things I can just give you to kind
of bake in your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France upon completion of these –
France retail, upon completion of these transactions which now we expect for Canada in Q1 2024; and then
France, as we initially ambitioned, we're aiming 1st of January 2024. The second one, you have to expect that
balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in 2024 and that will give us support for NII. The third one is
obviously the structural hedging which I mentioned a bit earlier and the impact they will have on more stabilization
of outlook for NII. And obviously, the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you're going to use and what
pass-through rates you're going to use. And then last but not the least, we are investing a lot in our non-NII or fee
income-earning businesses and do expect fee income-earning businesses to continue driving some of that
growth.
That's it for the NII component. Noel, I can talk to distribution...

So, dividend. So what we shared is that we're going to pay a 50% dividend payout ratio excluding notable items. I
think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I'm not going to comment on the size
of the dividend, but what I'm going to say is in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we're
working on, and you can as well do the math, Armando (sic) [Aman] (00:33:33). The first one is share buybacks.
As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count. And to the extent, we ambition to continue on the
journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital-generative, which is what we forecast. You have to adjust
your denominator by the share count. The second thing is the NII stabilization actions we're taking which should
give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle. And the third and fourth – third one is obviously our cost
discipline will be maintained. Even though we haven't yet or we're not ready to share numbers, we will maintain
the discipline.
And lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we're putting in fee-generating areas such
as investment in wealth are also initiatives to support/mitigate turn in our earnings and therefore return and
possible dividends beyond 2024.

Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Hi, everyone. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Maybe can I have two, please? The first one just on
distribution, perhaps. [ph] going by (00:35:02) Georges' thoughts on potential for buybacks in the second half of
the year, looking at your capital ratio, obviously you probably have to make a couple of adjustments [indiscernible]
(00:35:14) that 25 basis points. And then we've got the buyback that you've announced today, that's 50 basis
points off the headline level. Just thinking about your RoTE guidance does imply [indiscernible] (00:35:28) second
half. So, just wondering if you can scope for us, Georges, what the buyback might be from here. And then the
second one, just the lull on Wealth Management revenue growth. If I look at the Wealth Management revenue this
quarter, roughly $3 billion, just sort of stable from Q1. I'm wondering if that understates some of the momentum
that you are building within the business. So, if you could just help us understand how you expect the Wealth
Management revenues to go from there, that would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, happy to do that. I'll let George take the buyback question first.

Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, in terms of the buyback, obviously, the fact that today we announced a $2 billion buyback will today have an
impact on our Q3 CET1 ratio of 25 basis points. But you do expect us to continue generating profitability which
will build capital, 50% of which will be provisioned for dividend, as in dividend based on the 50% dividend payout
ratio anticipation. And therefore, that buyback will take into the additional capital generation. So, I wouldn't look at
Q3 25 basis points due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge. This is – obviously, this is just
upfronting, if you want, the profit generation that we will be doing in the quarter. Beyond that, again, at this stage,
what I can say is, we believe we remain capital-generative for the foreseeable future and as long as we are
capital-generative, we remain – we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks. But, obviously, we will
review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio.
And just want to also highlight and probably answering your question, Rauf (sic) [Raul] (00:37:29), and
complementing the question of Armando (sic) [Aman] (00:37:31) earlier that the Canada sale expected in Q1
2024 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a $0.21 dividend, which will, you
know, we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 2024, and then, the residual part of it, we will utilize to
supplement or complement or top-up any capital buyback we are planning to do.

Thank you. I think it's a fair comment. On your second question, what we're talking about here is very much
growth in lead indicators. You know, the $27 billion of net new invested assets here in Asia in the first half, up
21%. Globally, net new invested assets growth of $75 billion over the past 12 months. A growth in our aggregate
invested assets of 7% globally. You know, they're strong lead indicators, an additional 0.5 million international
customers in the past 12 months. For me, they're the lead indicators. I think you're absolutely right. There'll be a
lag effect as you turn that customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue, but that's why we're talking
about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward, and
give us some cushion, an offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post 2023 and post 2024. So, we
think it's the right thing to do. And you're right, the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria
that we're sharing with you.
If you remember growth in our Wealth business in Mainland China, you know, we started with zero wealth
managers just over two years ago. We've now got 1,400. Our ambition is to get to 3,000 over the – the relatively
near term over the next couple of – couple of years or so. Again, that will be revenue generative as an offset,
because most of that is fee based, as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates. So, I think
your second comment is a fair comment, but I'd turn that into the positive rather than the negative.

build revenue from a pretty low base up rapidly.

We'll take one more from the lines of Andrew Coombs and then we'll turn to the live audience in Hong Kong,
please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. Just firstly on Chinese commercial real estate. [indiscernible]
(00:40:23) absent of charges in Q1 and more additional charges in Q2. They – what triggered those additional
charges and then when you talk about the downside scenario on slide 16, I think previously, [indiscernible]
(00:40:40) marketing lower, should we just take off $0.3 billion to $0.7 billion, or can you provide the framework
around what you think the downside scenario now is? And then my second question, perhaps I could just invite
you to make some comments on the [indiscernible] (00:40:57) 14-point plan on cash savings that was released
yesterday and any implications you think that might have for your UK business. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I'll take the second. But, George, you want to take the first?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Andrew. So, we have put in more charges in Q2. The total charges was $0.3 billion or the sum of Q1
and Q2, Q1 being very benign, is $0.3 billion. Most of these charges are on Stage 3s. These are more technical
adjustments over names that have defaulted. So, where we stand now in terms of charges is, we are comfortable
with the charges we have against this portfolio on China CRE. Now, with regards to the plausible downside
scenario, we indicated $1 billion at the year-end as a plausible downside. We have indeed crystallized $0.3 billion
of it. So without being precise on the math here, it is indeed a residual circa $0.7 billion that remains a plausible
downside which may or may not materialize over the coming few quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. And with regard to the FCA and the work they're doing on savings accounts, I think, was your second
question, listen, we believe in both the mortgage book and the savings – the deposit book, we've tried to make
sure that we are offering a good range of products to our clients whereby they have choices. So, on savings,
we've got a good competitive range of fixed rate deposit accounts in the market. We also believe we've got good
pricing in place for more instant access-type savings accounts or deposit accounts. We will participate with the
FCA and – on any review they do. We believe, if you take our two-year fixed rate savings account in the UK
based on the yield curve in the UK, we're offering savers the opportunity to get 5.1% on that two fixed term – two-
year fixed term savings account. If you compare that to our two-year fixed mortgage products that we are offering
12


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
to our customers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, we're in the market at around about 5.53%. And for new-to-bank
customers, we'd be in the market of about 6.1%.
So, we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level
and as ever, there is a price difference between term product and instant access products because of their
maturity and the liquidity risk. So, we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately. We are very
cognizant of the pressures that UK customers face at this point in time. We certainly try to remain competitive and
to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so, with high interest rates in the yield curve and
higher rates of inflation. But we will fully participate with any review that the FCA take. We're also trying to
encourage, through marketing prompts, customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and
they meet their circumstances. Now, we can't – can't and should not force them into term savings, but we need to
make sure they are aware of our term savings products should they want to take advantage of it. So, hopefully
that answers your question.
Can we take the next question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A

Questions from the floor in Hong Kong. We'll take two. Catherine and then Nick and then then I'll come back to
you Sam a bit later.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine (Jingjun) Li Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Hi. My name is Catherine Li from JPMorgan and I have two questions. One is in a more long term and one is
more near term. For the long-term questions, I will ask management if you have – if you can give us any color on
potential impact of Basel III reform. Because I think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and
shareholder return, right. And then I think the impact on capital because of this potential regulatory changes will
have an impact on how we model in a future capital return. But this is more in long term, I understand that. I just
want to get some color, any color, particularly after the US regulator release that Basel III end game, like how
would that change our present forecast on that? So, this is for the long-term question. And then, on the near-term,
just now, I think management gave us a number, potential additional ECL charges on China's CRE is, $0.7 billion.
And then, I also noticed that for our guidance for full year, credit cost is 40 basis points.
But if I look at the first half, it's a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualized basis, right? So, that additional
upside on credit costs, like have we included that $0.7 billion or that $0.7 billion is outside of the 40 basis points
guidance? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think I'll take the second one first, and then, ask George to cover the more technical, difficult Basel III question.
So, on the ECL, we decided to maintain guidance of 40 basis points on ECL because there's still a lot of
economic uncertainty out there. There's economic uncertainty around China current real estate. There's economic
uncertainty generally in the world. We've had a good first-half performance on ECL, and as you say, you know,
$1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points. So, we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of
that risk that's inherent in the commercial real estate book in China. But, I think I'd be misleading you if everything
was so scientifically proven, because you've got to – it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world. So,
13


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
yeah, I could easily say, yes, we've got capacity to absorb that, but it depends what happens elsewhere in the
world.
So – but we do believe we have – it's right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECLs of 40
basis points. And we have capacity in the second half relative to the first half performance to absorb some
additional shocks, should they come through from near-term economic issues. George, do you want to handle
Basel III?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, just – maybe just finishing on the ECL point. I would caution you not to annualize H1. If you look at
Q2 at $0.9 billion as a more normalized level, so that is more a level that you can look at, whereas Q1 was an
unusually quite close. So, this is why H1 will look low to your taste. So, on Basel III. Look, so the first thing to
share about Basel III is we need to know the final rules. At this stage, most of these rules are still in draft form and
they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule. The second thing I will share is that, based on the
current draft rules in – as per our PRA standards for the group holdings, there will be a minor improvement initially
in our RWAs. But as the output floor starts kicking in 5 years into the journey, so from 25 plus 5 years, there is a
likelihood that the output floor will catch us and net-net the impact may be in a material up or down, but in material
up as we look at it this way.
This being said, just want to caution one thing. The US obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out
more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our US operations. It remains a marginal
impact. We're likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that. But those rules
will impact our local reporting for our US entity. We'll not change the way we report at the group level. So, we will
need to navigate both if you want, in parallel.

Nick Lord Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore) Pte.
Thank you. Yeah, it's Nick Lord from Morgan Stanley. Again, a couple of questions, if I may, please. I think
George has given a very thorough description of how you might sustain earnings sort of post-returning rates. But,
obviously, a lot of that fee generation is going to come at a cost. So, I just wondered if I could invite you to talk
about how you think of balancing that fee generation with costs over the next sort of two to three years. And then
secondly, a little bit more specific, but you're now sort of three or four months into having bought SVB. You spoke
a little bit about it here. I just wonder if you could give us a little bit more detail on how your plans have evolved for
that business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Nick. And by cost, I'm assuming you mean investment cost to get to it?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
Nick Lord Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore) Pte.
Investment costs against operating costs, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, that's fair. Listen, you're absolutely right. We're keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank. But
what we're doing is we're reallocating cost from two. And what we were typically reallocating is from what I call
bad cost, costs that are associated with low returning portfolios, low returning business activities in certain
markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitized. So, if you look at our cost
performance, I think we increased our investment in IT cost by 12% so far this year first half to first half. We
increased some of our investment cost in our global businesses, and we reduced costs elsewhere. And that's
what's getting us back to the 3%. So, we're investing and saving at the same time. And that is a phenomenon that
probably historically HSBC is not being greater. It's typically been cost management or cost investment, and it's
been a cycle. You manage costs tight and then you invest. We're definitely trying to do both at the same time.
And there's a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base. And that's how we're building
out the 1,400 people in mainland China. Because we're saving costs through other country exits or the market
exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centers, that's
allowing that investment to take place and that's been the journey for the past three years. On the SVB, the
integration is going well. The business we've had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was
profitable, the day we bought it, it is still profitable. We're going through systems migration at the moment. One
statistic, which is probably an important guide for the future. In the three months post acquisition, we took in new
to bank customers at a higher rate than the three months prior to acquisition. So, in the transition of ownership
from the previous owners to us, we've seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in
that first three months period.
That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections, and frankly, the positive brand
and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the US, we recruited a team here in Hong
Kong, and we recruited a team in Israel. So, my view that there is strong growth prospects in that business not
just for the next two or three years, I'm doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the 5
to 10 to 15-year timeframe. This is an important sector of the economy and we're willing to invest in it, so I'm very
pleased with how it's going. We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on how material,
what are the numbers, and I think we'll come back to you at the end of the year with if you add this all together,
the investment and the current [indiscernible] (00:53:40) business, what could that potentially look like going
forward and how material is that. But that is something, if it's okay, we'll give you more towards the end of this
year with the full-year results.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Guy, hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Yes, hi there. Thanks for taking questions. Good morning or good afternoon. I have one back on cost and then
one on specifically in the UK. So, I mean, on costs, in the context of a very strong top line and then upgrade to the
RoTE guidance this year and next, interested in how you're thinking about investment spend in that context of [ph]
hopefully (00:54:41) a better revenue backdrop than you previously anticipated. Your guidance is very clear for
this year [indiscernible] (00:54:48), but next year and beyond also some mindful consensus of fairly modest
growth next year from where you're guiding the market, adjusting for things like Canada. So just how
[indiscernible] (00:54:59) appropriate you think that is in the context of what is an aggressive top line and given
[ph] all the (00:55:03) opportunities available to you? And the second question is on NIM in the UK. You saw very
strong growth in the second quarter in [indiscernible] (00:55:10) banking in stark contrast to some UK peers.
If you could talk about some of the dynamics, how you're seeing deposit beta and mix evolving. I appreciate it's
very difficult to be too specific, but any sort of perspective there. And whether ultimately, NIM in [ph] UK retail
banking (00:55:26) would likely to peak now at this good level. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks. Well, certainly on cost, it's a very simple answer. We're not giving any guidance at this stage on 2024.
We will give an update on 2024 guidance at the end of the year. But on 2023, we've given, I think, a strong
commitment on cost discipline. I also will maintain strong cost discipline in 2024, but I'm not going to quantify what
that means in terms of percentage growth at this stage. On the UK, George, it would be good if you could just
share some of the information that we've got on the UK, particularly the progress we're still making in the UK
mortgage market despite the pressures in the UK mortgage market. It would be good to put some color on that,
please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, Guy, maybe I'll start by talking the dynamic and I'll delve into NIM specifically. But first, in terms of
pass-through rates on the deposits, for the last 50 basis points of rate hikes from the Bank of England, we've
passed through to our savings rate, retail saving rate around 70%. So, we believe from a consumer point of view,
we are competitive having pass-through, and obviously this is a higher than 50% pass-through. The overall
booked pass-through within the around 40% – between 40% and 50%. But clearly, the marginal pass-throughs
are higher at these high level of rates. Equally, on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share, so we've
grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8%. And our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so
16


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now, if I go specifically on the NIM, look, without talking to our
peers' NIM, some parameters that you can use when you're doing your assessment and your analysis.
The first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-
deposit ratio. The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance, so that
component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that
our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e., we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to
be at higher levels. So, we have little "baggage" from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e., when rates were
very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards. And we're not bugged by, if you want, low
interest-earning assets from older structural hedges. And in terms of expectations, I think it's fair to expect that the
increase we've seen in Q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year.

Tom, hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Thanks very much. Good morning. Just on your revised RoTE guidance for 2023 and 2024 [indiscernible]
(00:58:54) excluding the material notable items. Understand when I look at your company's consensus, you have
got material notable items in there. I think, for instance, the sale of Canada is boosting [indiscernible] (00:59:09)
consensus return. So, my point – I guess, my question is I think that that potentially obscures the size of the sort
of underlying upgrade that your guidance is sort of return on tangible equity [indiscernible] (00:59:25) 2024. My
concern is whether the way you [indiscernible] (00:59:29) because the notables now are part of your numbers
and, therefore, I think it makes sense that consensus looks at it that way. Just wondering whether this
presentation is making it maybe more difficult for investors to understand the underlying drivers of the business
and whether that may be the effect of your rating at some level. I wonder if you could comment on that thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
George, you want to pick that up, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure, Tom. So, look, our RoTE guidance of mid-teens initially has been excluding notable items. So, for this year
– well, for this year, obviously, we had two notable items in Q1; the provisional gain of SVB, $1.5 billion; but also
the reversal of the impairment of the French retail business, $2.1 billion. As we look to year-end, we do anticipate
that we will reinstate this impairment some time in H2 for a possible, obviously, closure of the transaction on the
1st of January. So, that notable item, if you want, washes itself out from our full year expectations. As regards
2024, I think the Canada impact is a couple percentage points on our RoTE, so whether you stretch the mid-teens
17


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
a little bit on either side and you may still be right. But we would like to take it out because obviously, it remains –
while we're very confident in the resolution, it remains an element that is subject to additional – to continued
regulatory approvals. So, you can do your math with or without.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, I suppose the way we're looking at mid-teens as – if you look at the first half, we printed a headline rate of
22.4% RoTE. If you take out the two notable items, you get to an 18.5% RoTE. We guide in mid-teens to be
equivalent you could say with the 2018 number, not the 2022 number. And if you think about 2024, there'll be a
profit on the sale of Canada, assuming that transaction completes. There'll be a capital policy around that in the
form of dividend and in the form of buybacks. But we're not including that profit on sale within our guide and we're
not including that in our definition of mid-teens. That's sort of over and above because – so, what we're trying to
say is we're giving you a mid-teens RoTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity
achieving it. That's the way I'd look at it. So, we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we
mean by mid-teens, and it doesn't include the big one-offs, either the one-off positive or the one-off negatives.
We're looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Just quickly come back on that because I think that the real question – thank you. Thank you. I guess my real
question is this mid-teens, I mean, is this now what you view as more of a through-the-cycle type of level of
profitability for you guys? If you look at consensus 2025 at the moment, you have that dropping away again
18


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
because, I guess, people – the one-offs have dropped out. But, I mean, it sounds to me that you think now maybe
interest rates have normalized to a level where that's probably more realistic [indiscernible] (01:03:07) the last
decade or so, and maybe your profitability in mid-teens is now what you're comfortable with, is that what you're
saying on a more of a through the cycle sort of basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think you've overread it. Because what we've said is the guidance is for 2023 and 2024. We're not giving you
guidance for 2025 and beyond. We will do that at some stage. So, I wouldn't overread that. But clearly in 2025
and beyond, you've got interest rates that will start to come off. But I'm also talking about building alternative
revenue streams, building balance sheet growth, because as interest rates come off, economic recovery improves
and the balance sheet will start to grow again. So, our job as a management team and our philosophy is, we want
to try and make sure we can mitigate some of that downside risk, either through hedging or alternative growth
strategies to stabilize the RoTE over time. But for the avoidance of doubt, we are not guiding at the moment on
2025 RoTE. We're only guiding on 2023 and 2024. And we'll have to see how the economy – the economics of
the world develop. And I think George should probably reiterate what he said at the end of that, because the line
went a bit hazy. George, on consensus...

Hello. I just got two questions. The first one is [indiscernible] (01:04:53) non-interest income and especially in
Wealth in Asia. So, if I look at your Asian entity recruiting, it looks like revenues [indiscernible] (01:05:03) quarter-
on-quarter, but NII gone up a little bit. So, that suggests to me that [indiscernible] (01:05:09) down the middle.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
Just wondering what you're seeing in front line, especially with regards to Wealth. And obviously, Hong Kong
GDP print yesterday was quite a bit weaker than expected, so just what you're seeing in context and
[indiscernible] (01:05:25) expectation about China business, to what extent do you think that that might help you,
and so that's my first question. And then the second question is on deposit migration in Hong Kong because I just
noticed in slide 41, it looks a lot like the Hang Seng which is obviously traditionally very strong retail trading
franchise. It looks like deposit migration [indiscernible] is turning (01:05:49) the other way, so does that suggest
that the migration is [ph] maybe dead (01:05:52) in Hong Kong [ph] and maybe conking (01:05:54) out?

[indiscernible] (01:05:58). So, on the non-NII Wealth in Asia, you will observe actually the biggest pickup is in
insurance, sorry. First, taking the impact of funding, the trading book which is showing under non-NII and this
material is $1.2 billion. If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong
Kong. It does appear under non-NII but not fee income. That growth is kind of a reflection of the growth we've
seen in Q1. It's in the 40% to 50% growth year-on-year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China
and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of mainland Chinese policy, new policies. Non-Hong Kong business
about 30% of new policies are from mainland Chinese. As you would expect, insurance is a core component of
our Wealth, in particular here in Hong Kong, and that's a main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in
Wealth with regards equities trading and that's more reflective of the equity markets in general.
And I want to say the – while the Hong Kong GDP is a main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our
balance sheet, Wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviors, and it
is linked to sentiment in the market. With regard to your second question on migration. So, in HSBC, we continue
to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April. But that kind of continued at a
trend that we have been forecasting. Whereas in Hang Seng where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s
percent, our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate
sensitive deposits and allowed them, if you want, to accept some attrition against these highly rate sensitive, or
rate chasing deposits. And this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix. They're
benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise and they do not need necessarily
highly rate sensitive deposits at that margin.

Sam Wong Q
Analyst, Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd.
Thank you. Congrats on the strong results. Sam Wong from Jefferies. Just a very quick question on Hong Kong
mortgage. Mortgage rate in Hong Kong right now is well below HIBOR. Many smaller banks are actually backing
off from the mortgage market. So, do you see mortgage pricing in Hong Kong going up? And what would be the
NIM implications for that? So, that's the first question. The second question is on China. There are a lot of macro
concerns going on right now. So, how would you navigate through the macro uncertainties as a bank? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Thanks, Sam. Do you want to handle the mortgage?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 01-Aug-2023
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll take the first part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, Sam, the – first, our mortgage, we continue printing mortgages. Yes, indeed, the rates are quite attractive for
borrowers. And we increased our mortgage book, not a smaller – not a very large amount, but we increased our
mortgage book. So, we continue – and this is despite a subdued property sales in Hong Kong. We continue
increasing our book. The pricing, as you know, the mortgages are kept and the pricing is highly correlated to the
savings rate. So for instance, last week, we increased the saving rate by about 12.5 basis points on Hong Kong
dollar and automatically increases the cap and therefore the mortgage pricing today by 12.5 basis points. But I
see this as a natural evolution with rates, not a specific pricing for the mortgages or specific dynamic for the
mortgage pricing, if you want.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And in terms of China macro. So, we had a brief conversation before. It's – if you take all of the international
banks share of the Corporate debt market in mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share.
So, actually growing your Corporate Banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is
connecting mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions, GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the
sense of what you can do because you're still relatively niche in the market and what is a huge market. So, you
can get growth despite the fact that GDP, and by the way, GDP is still 5% plus. So, it's not bad, but you can still
get growth. Similarly in our Wealth business that we're pursuing in mainland China, we're pursuing an area which
is around about helping internationally orientated personal customers and particularly the domestic customers in
the Greater Bay Area get access to Wealth products, insurance products to help them with their protection needs
and their savings needs. And that is primarily targeted at the affluent or the emerging affluent sector rather than
particularly at the high net worth or ultra-high net worth.
Now, that is the core business we have here in Hong Kong. The way I look at it is that our proposition here in
Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong while we see that
same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area. And the engagement in between Greater Bay Area or the Guangdong
Province and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us. And what we're trying to do,
which is different to three, four years ago, we're targeting international Wealth and insurance as our primary
proposition as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong
Province. So, I think we see opportunity for growth. Yes, you can't ignore the macro environment, but we do see
conditions for good growth for our business in mainland China.
All right. Next question, our last.

Operator: Thank you. We will take a last question from the phone from Joseph Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. It's a double header from Jefferies on Q&A. Just a quick question. Most have been asked and answered. Just
on the dividend question that Tom Rayner asked. The answer was slightly long winded. If I interpret what you're
saying, it sounds like you would like the dividend, the ordinary, to be progressive. And then, secondly, can you
just discuss in the Hong Kong business of [indiscernible] (01:13:14) business, the NIM trend that was flat quarter-
on-quarter. How much was the US dollar denominated business in play there? Because if I look at your rate
sensitivity disclosures, the USD bucket is now – looks liability sensitive as opposed to asset sensitive. So, what –
how much of the NIM movement there, let's say, in an adverse sense was attributed to the US dollar business or
was it something else? Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Let me deal with the dividend one first. The guidance we've given is for 2023 and 2024 will have a 50%
payout ratio. In addition, we've guided to the first use of proceeds of Canada's sale proceeds will be a $0.21
special dividend. So, we're not giving any guidance on whether the dividends is progressive or not progressive.
We're only giving the guidance that we've just said, which is 50% of profits. Clearly, as a management team, our
ambition is to make our profits progressive. So. that's – but we're not guiding on dividend as a progressive
dividend policy. Our policy is 50% payout ratio. And that will be a function of earnings. And George, do you want
to cover Hong Kong NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, on the Hong Kong NIM, so the first – the NII increased by $0.1 billion, but the banking NIM increased by $0.4
billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now, the way the NIM –
the bank – sorry – the way the statutory NIM is computed is only looking at the NII component and therefore it's
showing flat. But as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards
to banking NIM, and that will give you more visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding
of the trading book. Now, in terms of sensitivity to the USD, you're actually also driving towards the same kind of
dynamic in the funding with the trading book. So, dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our
activities with. So, when you look at the NII sensitivity, dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies because
that's a funding currency, but essentially, dollars is funding our – funding of the trading book. And therefore, when
you look at the funding book sensitivity, we've put in a few kind of – few explanations on the slides where we
estimated this to be to the tune of $1.3 billion.
It is fair to assume most of it is dollars, and therefore reverses it and kind of re-normalizes our dollar sensitivity
overall on the balance sheet to be that of kind of negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points.

Well, I just want to say thank you very much for all of your questions and your time today. Really appreciate you
spending some time with us. Just to close with a couple of comments. We've had a good first six months. I'm
pleased with how the business is performing. We delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 22.4% or
18.5% excluding those notable items. And we've increased dividends and buybacks. I'm also confident about the
future. We still have opportunities to drive growth and to diversify revenue while retaining tight cost control. And
we have upgraded our returns guidance for 2023 and 2024. Richard and the team are available to you if you have
