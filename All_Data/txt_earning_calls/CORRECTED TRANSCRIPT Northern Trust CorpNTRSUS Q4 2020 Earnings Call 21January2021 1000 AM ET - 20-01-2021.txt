Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Our asset management business has seen considerable market share gains during 2020 within our liquidity
products. Our Northern Institutional Government Select Fund was named the Top Performing Government
Institutional Fund of 2020. Beyond our liquidity funds our quant active equity mutual funds and factor-based ETFs
performed well relative to their peers. We also continue to see growth in ESG mandates with assets under
management of over $125 billion at year end, up 30% from the prior year. Our asset servicing business which did
see a deferral in implementation activity earlier in the year finished 2020 with strong growth.
Recent notable public wins highlight our success globally and across products, and include Pershing Square
Capital Management, Emerald Technology Ventures, Sands Capital Management, Strategic Global Advisors,
First Sentier Investors and Westwood Holdings Group. We continue to invest and expand our asset servicing
solutions in areas such as our front office solutions, as well as outsourced trading and foreign exchange
execution. As we move forward in the current and persistent low interest rate environment, we've accelerated our
focus on driving greater efficiencies as well as continuing to grow organically in a scalable and profitable manner.
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our staff whose commitment, expertise and professionalism
throughout these extraordinary times has been exceptional.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter.

Jason J. Tyler
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Let's dive
into the financial statements of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net
income of $240.9 million. Earnings per share were $1.12 and our return on average common equity was 8.8%.
The quarter's results included the following three items; first, a $55 million severance charge in connection with
the reduction in force. This charge relates actions we're taking to eliminate approximately 500 positions globally,
representing about 2.5% of our staff. This is in line with our ongoing efforts around productivity and efficiency and
expected to result in annual run rate savings of approximately $50 million on a net basis.
Second, we recognized an $11.9 million occupancy-related expense relating to an early lease exit arising from
our workplace real estate strategy. And lastly, we recognized $26.8 million in tax expense related to the reversal
of tax benefits previously recognized through earnings. You can see on the bottom of page 2, equity markets
performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on a quarter lag or a
month lag asset levels and both the S&P 500 and EAFE Local had strong sequential performance based on those
calculations. It's worth noting that on a year-over-year basis the EAFE Local index remains negative, which
creates an unfavorable impact to our global fees compared to the prior year. As shown on this page, average
one-month and three-month LIBOR rates stabilized during the quarter with only modest decline.
Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was down
2%, with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income down 20%. Expenses increased 7%. The provision
for credit losses reflected a release of $2.5 million in the quarter compared to a release of $1 million in the prior
year. Net income was down 35%. In a sequential comparison, revenue grew 3% with non-interest income and net
interest income both up 3%. Expenses increased 5% and net income declined 18%. Return on average common
equity was 8.8% for the quarter down from 14.8% a year ago, and 10.5% in the prior quarter. Assets under
custody and administration of $14.5 trillion grew 21% from a year ago and increased 11% on a sequential basis.
Assets under custody of $11.3 trillion grew 22% from the year ago and increased 11% on a sequential basis.
Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, up 14% from a year ago and up 7% on a sequential basis.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, down 2% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and
other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1 billion and were up 3% from
last year and 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $69 million for the quarter, up 6% year-over-
year and up 11% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was driven by higher volumes and higher
volatility, while the sequential growth was primarily driven by higher volumes. The remaining components of
noninterest income totaled $93 million in the quarter, up 32% compared to one year ago and up 2% sequentially.
Within that, securities commissions and trading income increased 16% compared to a year ago and up 24%
sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were primarily driven by strong performance within
our core brokerage business. Other operating income increased 52% compared to the prior year and was down
7% sequentially. The increase compared to last year was primarily driven by a $20.8 million charge in the prior
year related to a decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio, partially offset by higher expense relating to
Visa swap agreements. The sequential decline was primarily associated with lower income in the supplemental
compensation plans, which also resulted in a related decrease within other operating expense.
Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $345 million in the fourth quarter, down 20% from
one year ago and up 3% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional
Services business, fees totaled $596 million in the fourth quarter and were up 5% year-over-year and up 2%
sequentially.
Custody and fund administration fees were $420 million and up 6% year-over-year and up 6% on a sequential
basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable currency translation,
partially offset by unfavorable non-US markets. The sequential increase was primarily driven by new business,
higher transaction volumes, favorable currency translation, as well as favorable markets.
Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $13.7 trillion at quarter-end, up 21% year year-
over-year and up 11% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were attributable to new
business, favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $125
million in the fourth quarter were up 8% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year growth
was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by money market fee waivers. The
sequential decline was primarily driven by higher money market fee waivers.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Growth
from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The
sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation, partially offset by net outflows.
Securities lending fees were $18 million in the quarter, down 22% year-over-year and down 11% sequentially.
Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower spreads. Average collateral levels were up
6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially.
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $430 million in the
fourth quarter and were up 1% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and
sequential performance were primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by money market fund fee
waivers.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $348 billion at quarter-end, up 11% year-
over-year and up 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by favorable
markets and net flows.
Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $345 million in the fourth quarter and was down 20% from the prior
year. Earning assets averaged $131 billion in the quarter, up 22% versus the prior year. Average deposits were
$115 billion and were up 29% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.05% in the quarter and was
down 54 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily to lower interest rates as well
as mix shift within the balance sheet.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 3%. Average earning assets increased 1% on a
sequential basis while average deposits were up 2%. The net interest margin increased 2 basis points
sequentially primarily due to balance sheet mix and lower costs, partially offset by lower asset yield. Net interest
income also benefited in the quarter from approximately $5 million in nonrecurring benefits relating to the FTE
adjustment and interest recovery on nonaccrual loans.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and were 7% higher than the prior year and
5% higher sequentially. The current quarter included a $55 million severance charge related to a reduction in
force and an $11.9 million increase associated with an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate
strategy. Expense during the prior quarter included a $43.4 million charge related to a corporate action processing
error. Excluding these items in each period, expenses were up 1% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.
Compensation expense totaled $525 million in the quarter and included $52.5 million in severance-related
charges. Excluding the charge, compensation was up 2% from both a year ago and sequentially. The year-over-
year growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, base pay adjustments, and
unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower incentives. The sequential growth was driven by salaries
and higher incentives.
Employee benefits expense of $102 million was up 10% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. The year-
over-year increase was primarily related to higher pension expense. The sequential increase was driven primarily
by higher medical costs.
Outside services expense was $208 million in the quarter and included $2.5 million related to severance charges.
Excluding the charge, outside services expense was flat compared to the prior year and up 11% sequentially. The
sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services, legal and consulting services, and third-party
advisory fees.
Equipment and software expense of $176 million was up 7% from one year ago and up 3% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization as well as higher software support costs,
partially offset by lower software disposition costs. The sequential increase was driven by increases in software
disposition, software support and amortization costs.
Occupancy expense of $67 million for the quarter included the previously mentioned $11.9 million occupancy
charge. Excluding this item, the category was down 4% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. The
year-over-year decline was driven by lower rent, as well as lower building depreciation and real estate taxes. The
sequential increase was primarily driven by higher building operation costs and real estate taxes.

Other operating expense of $72 million was down 18% from one year ago and down 43% sequentially. Excluding
the prior quarter's $43.4 million charge, costs were down 14% sequentially. The year-over-year comparison was
primarily driven by lower expense related to business promotional activities. The sequential comparison was
impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust-sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter and
lower costs associated with supplemental compensation plans.
Turning to the full-year, our results in 2020 are summarized on page 8. Net income was $1.2 billion, down 19%
compared to 2019; and earnings per share were $5.46, down 18% from the prior year. On the right margin of this
page, we outlined the nonrecurring impacts that we called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for
the year of 11.2% compared to 14.9% in 2019.
Full-year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 4%
in 2020. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset
by the impact of money market fee waivers. Foreign exchange trading income grew 16%, driven by increases in
market volatility and higher client volumes. Net interest income declined 14%. Average earning assets during the
period increased by 16%, while the net interest margin declined 41 basis points due to lower interest rates.
The net result was flat overall revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. On a reported basis, expenses were up 5%
from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense items noted in both year, expenses were up 3% from 2019.
Turning to page 10, our capital ratios remained strong, with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.8% under the
standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.6% under both
the standardized and advanced approaches. During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per
share, totaling $147 million to common stockholders.
Now, looking back at 2020 showed the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our
clients' needs. And we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've
come to expect. As we begin the new year, our competitive position in wealth management, asset management
and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Mark, Mike,
Lauren, and I would be happy to answer any of your questions. Madison, please open the line.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Glenn
Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Glenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hello, there. So, I appreciate you noted the 4% trust fee growth in 2020, some of that's market, some of that's
new business. And in the press release, you referred to the growth agenda. I wonder if we could just revisit what
reasonable expectations and reasonable markets, whatever that means, could be for trust fee growth over the
coming years, and where your investments are made under this – are being made under this growth agenda. I
appreciate that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Glenn. So, let me start on the growth side and separate the business into the two reported segments, and
maybe touch on asset management as well. In C&IS, the quarter, and frankly, the year reflected good growth.
And you see 6% sequential growth from a trust fee perspective in C&IS. 1 point of that 6% comes from more
macro factors between currency markets, but 5 points of that 6% come from good growth in the business. And
that said, I'd provide a little caution there by splitting that 5% in half and saying about 2.5% coming from what you
would think of as very traditional trust fee growth that's more ongoing in nature and then about 2.5% coming from
items that are more one-time in nature.
And so, that could be true-ups on pricing and transaction-related volumes that we wouldn't necessarily consider
predictive of what's going forward. But certainly, we view the fourth quarter for C&IS as onboarding significant
new business. There were a couple of very significant pieces of new business onboarded there and the pipeline in
the short run still feels good.
When you shift to Wealth Management and think about the growth there, the business did just an outstanding job,
I think, of engaging with clients over the course of the year, the growth there, and this is fine. This is the nature of
that financial model. It came more from growth in equity markets over the course of the year. It was a very odd
year for onboarding new clients in Wealth, and so we'll see what that looks like going forward. But couldn't feel
stronger about how the group did from client interaction over the course of the year.
And then, a difficult one to predict is asset management. We obviously had extraordinary growth into the money
market mutual funds. And it's anybody's guess how long that stays on and whether or not we see a shift back to
more risk on transactions or not and what the growth looks like there. But I also have to say that business is
working on other elements as well to try and bring organic growth into the business.
You asked about where we're investing as well and there are several areas. Each of the businesses has their own
view of where they're investing, and you see some of those coming to fruition in different areas. But one constant

theme across the company is digital. And you'll see in every aspect of the business how we're trying to ensure
we're connecting better with clients in our digital engagement. And you see that show up in the income statement
in a couple of different line items in outside services, and equipment and software, for example.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
I appreciate all of that. My one tiny follow-up is, if you could just give a little more color on, the wealth
management fees only up 1%. I know we have some lag pricing coming and the fourth quarter was up huge. But
just curious what might be holding back on the fees, even without adding new accounts, markets are good. Just
curious to have a little more color. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, you hit on a key item which is, there's a lag that takes place there. And then, secondly, I think it's a
little harder for you to see, but we did have positive flows in the fourth quarter in the Wealth business, which was
good. And I do think even if you'd said we were going to go through this environment of not being able to be in
front of clients a lot and it's just – it's very, very difficult to test the growth in the Wealth business based on what
we went through this year in terms of how we're interacting with clients.
I would say that the overall trends of clients using us for deposits and also the flows we saw particularly in fourth
quarter, I think it's everyone got more attuned with doing normal business more electronically and more virtually is
a relatively positive sign.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Jason. Good morning. So, maybe building on Glenn's question also a little bit. In the past, you guys have
talked about fee growth kind of aligning with expense growth. You've announced a couple of, obviously, expense-
cutting initiatives that should help 2021, maybe even trickle down into 2022. The market is obviously a big helper.
So, help us understand maybe how that relationship should progress through 2021, and maybe you can talk to
that both sort of including the tailwinds from markets and excluding that, meaning that if fees are up including the
benefit of the market, how much of that will naturally trickle down into higher expenses and are you still kind of

targeting organic expense growth to mimic organic fee growth excluding the market? So, a couple of things in
there, but I can clarify if it's not 100%, but maybe we can start there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No. I'm going to take the theme as operating leverage and organic growth, and you tell me if I hit on too little. So,
first of all, as I think back on the year and we've been talking about it internally, one of the things that jumps out is,
we did have a- it was a positive year in terms of fee operating leverage.
And if you look at the last few years, you go back to 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, we – it was relatively close to zero
which actually isn't bad, because over time we'll get market lift. But in 2017, we had adjusted operating – fee
operating leverage, it was positive at about 0.7. 2018 was plus 1.6. 2019 was negative 0.5. 2020 was actually
positive 1.6. And then, if you unwrap the quarters within 2020, third quarter plus 2 points and fourth quarter was
plus 4 points, which is one of the best quarters – maybe the best quarter we've had since we started tracking this
number this closely over the last five years or so. But I can appreciate that from your perspective people are
always trying to how do we match that to what we would expect on the income statement.
And so, let me just flip to the supplement, flip to the press release tables and go to the detail – the year-over-year
detail which is just page 1 of the supplement, and let's just – I think it might be helpful for people to circle a couple.
This is how I think about the quarter and the overall run rate in hindsight.
If you take trust fees of $1,026 million last year, take out – let's exclude sec lending, so take out $17.6 million,
take out waivers of $23.5 million, and we had market lift zero in C&IS, there's probably $10 million to $15 million in
Wealth. And so, you get to about a $1,020 million number. And then you compare that to 2019 and for the
quarter, take out sec lending again, and you get something like $970 million. And so, the growth was more like
$970 million to $1,020 million. That's 500 basis points of growth. And that gets more to how we look at it.
And then, you compare that to the expenses, do the same type of analysis and take the $1,151 million, take out
the $55 million in severance, we talked about take out the $12 million in real estate, and you get to $1,084 million.
And then compare that to the $1,072 million, it's more like 1 point. And so, those are the line items I think to look
at and to kind of do an analysis to at least, you're getting closer to how we think about it. And by the way, I didn't
even add in how we moved from the reported to the organic numbers on the expense side. There's things like
third-party advisory fees and other stuff which we take out. But that's how we track internally. Those are the first
numbers we're looking at. So, hopefully, that's helpful in getting at the spirit of what you're asking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. No. It definitely helps. I was thinking that maybe we can talk a little bit more kind of perspectively as you
think about 2021, and I know you guys are not in the business of giving explicit guidance, but obviously there are
some cost initiatives there at play. And I'm just kind of trying to think about, like, given normal market conditions,
given your sort of views on the pipeline and the organic growth into 2021, what is the outlook for expense growth,
maybe a little more explicitly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Alex, it's Mike. Why don't I jump in here as well, just to build on what Jason said? To your point, I – we do
look at that relationship between organic fee growth and then our expense growth. And when we see that the

environment is making it more challenging on the organic fee growth side, absolutely need to focus more on the
expense to make sure that we have that positive relationship. And then, Jason went through, we were able to
achieve that in 2020. Now, again, very unusual year, I would say on both sides of that relationship. But that's what
we're looking at going into the next year. Now, if we have the opportunity to grow faster organically and profitably,
then we'll look to do that. But not knowing that, we don't want to go in with higher expense expectations and then
have another year where it's very unpredictable as to your ability to onboard that new business. So, that
absolutely, the relationship holds and it's just in different environments you have to attack differently.

Hey, Brennan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to revisit the outlook on the fee waivers and
the NII. I know there's a great deal of uncertainty and it's all really subject to what's happening to rates particularly
on the short end. But I believe, Jason, you had updated the guide to the upper end of around 35%, I think the
range was 25% to 35%, and you said tacking to the upper end of that on the waivers front. And so, I just was
curious whether or not we should assume that that holds since you didn't update it. And then you also have in the
past said that – I think you had said that you expected NII to be generally stable from 4Q levels, of course,
depending on what happens with loan growth. So, is that still true and how are you thinking about loan growth
from here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, let me take those, I think, three questions. So, on waivers, the $35 million run rate is pretty good. And I think
from here, it's less about what we can see internally from repricing and it's more what you guys can see externally
from what's happened in the shorter end of the yield curve, so overnight repo and what does the shorter end of
the curve look like and AUM. And so, I think for the run rate on an annual basis right now is $140 million to – it's
$140 million to $150 million. And that we expect to hold in. The book is effectively 100%. It's 98%, 99%, 100%
repriced at this point.
And so, from here, it's those factors that I mentioned that – and I think the key is to be careful and ensure you
realize that disparity between C&IS and Wealth, and where the waivers are hitting because the Wealth waivers –
well, because the Wealth fee rates are tend to be higher, they got into waiver land first. But the AUM isn't as high.
And so, now that rates have come all the way down and the duration isn't protective anymore, the waivers are
actually going to be heavier in C&IS. And the relationship's not linear. It's their step functions in the middle
because you've got some very large funds that kick in at certain levels right around where we're investing right
now. But those are the key things I'd want you to keep in mind as you try and model out waivers.

On NII, I did mention there's probably $5 million of the $345 million that was more one-time in nature. And so,
from there, I think actually very similar theme to what I talked about on waivers. From this point forward, it's pretty
predictable the things that – we communicated things we can see which are that we're running off $1 billion to $2
billion a quarter at about 100-basis-point delta. And so, that gets you $3 million, $4 million, $5 million of drag,
about a 1.5 point maybe on a sequential basis. And that has been offset over the last couple quarters by deposit
levels hanging in higher than what we thought of – than what we thought and also loans hanging in higher than
we thought.
You'll also notice in this quarter there's a little bit of a shift from the money – from central bank deposits into the
securities portfolio. Nothing dramatic there, but that was also somewhat protective. And that'll stay going forward.
And so, from here, the key things are what do you think is going to happen with loan volumes, what do you think
is going to happen with deposits, and what do you think is going to – and then also, we're obviously losing two
days coming from fourth quarter to first, which is probably $3 million, $4 million a day.
And then, you asked about loan growth. And it's been a positive surprise that loans have held in there. It's
something we've talked about internally. We've been working on and making sure that we're talking to clients
about our appetite and what our hold levels and interest levels are. And again, clients tend to come to us for
liquidity. And there's some correlation between the deposits and the loans, for sure. And so, that's been a positive
that it's held in, and it's been one of the offsets to that continued drag of 1 point or so a quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. That's all helpful color. I appreciate that, Jason. So, when we think about organic growth, you walked
through – in response to an earlier question, you walked through some of the rates and some of the kind of the
profile has looked, which is helpful. Is the back half of the year more like what we should expect, kind of like a 2%
to 4% organic? Does that seem like something that you guys can hold in this weird environment that we all stock
are dealing with for a little longer, I guess. Is that the way we should think about it from here?
And just kind of as a tack-on for that, I think you guys had said there was a nonrecurring servicing fee in Wealth,
so if it's possible to quantify that, that'd be great, too. Thanks for my multipart questions here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, the nonrecurring servicing fee in Wealth, it was...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A

A couple million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

...a couple million dollars and just has to do with some – it's typical business for us. It's a estate settlement-type
work and other items. There's a couple real estate-related items. But I think a couple million dollars.
On organic growth, broadly, I think you can go back to separating it. C&IS, Pete Cherecwich would say the part of
what we experienced in fourth quarter, part of it was a catch-up of some of the new business we had that was in
the one-not-funded category. And so, certainly, shouldn't expect 6% sequential continued increases there.

But that said, the pipe – and we had said earlier in the year that we felt like the pipeline had been delayed but not
cut off. And so, this fourth quarter was not super surprising to us and that we were able to get onboarded a lot of
the new business that we – that had been delayed. And so, that's good.
The other piece of good news is the near-term pipeline. Their view is it still seems decent. And that said, the
longer-term pipeline, they're paranoid about. And so, that's just something to watch. On the Wealth side, it's more
of a continued story underneath the numbers that you see there. GFO continues to have to expect the business to
do pretty well. And the East region continues to do pretty well, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter but over longer
periods of time.
And then you see the other regions that are more mature not doing and not having the same migrational benefits
that the East region does. So that includes Florida and the development of Wealth on the East Coast not as
robust. And so, it will be interesting to see whether or not the experience we had in 2020 of not being able to be in
front of clients as much – how much impact that had in suppressing organic growth.

So, yeah, just wanted to dig in a little bit to some of the organic growth commentary particularly on the Wealth
outside. So you cited the positive growth trends in 4Q. But taking a step back, the organic growth in the Wealth
business was much more tepid since the start of COVID. And then, maybe it's a little bit tough to reconcile given
some of your wealth peers, but admittedly greater focus on less affluent cohorts are seeing some acceleration

over the past few months across both the wire house and independent channels. I know there are idiosyncratic
factors that drive some divergence in organic growth trends, but if you can give some insight in terms of what we
should be looking for as the economic recovery continues and this vaccine deployment, just to better anticipate
the timing of the organic growth getting back to a more normalized run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I think it's hard to predict. I think it'll – a lot of it will depend on how things open up again. And I think it's
also important to keep in mind – and I don't know specifically the peers you're talking about at all. We deal – we're
targeting a client base that's really at the upper end, and imagine unplugging the – getting the comfort level, the
confidence level to unplug potentially generations of connectivity with a family office from a custody perspective,
from an investment management perspective and putting that back in place again. And so, again, the business
had – is lower but positive flows for the quarter for the year. And so, we're all looking and monitoring and seeing
what it looks like, but not surprising that in this environment some of the organic growth maybe not look as strong
as what it has been historically.
Mike, I don't know, if you want to add any perspective from your end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Just, I think it's a fair and appropriate question, Steven. And when you think about fee growth for Wealth
Management, as you know, there's a number of drivers in that overall fee number. And so, if you break it down a
little bit, for us, there's an advisory component to it, and then there is the investment management fee component
to it as well. So, right there you can have different dynamics within that. So, Jason saying, we've been building the
business, but you could have – and that will drive the advisory fee. But on the investment product side, if you will,
where they're utilizing Northern Trust product and others, because we're open architecture, that will have a
dynamic as to what's happening to the overall Wealth Management fees. And, again, our approach with our
clients, as Jason has pointed out, is to give them a holistic approach to this in outcome. So I – through different
environments, that's going to have a different impact on what the outcomes is – outcomes are for that mix.
And then, beyond that, I would say that's just the fee component. Again, these are holistic relationships that
involve banking as well. And so, there's always going to be a shift there between what they put into funds versus
what may go on the balance sheet, situations where they're borrowing more, credit is a bigger component. And
those are important as well. We focus a lot on fees for the right reason. But overall, the relationships are much
broader, and we're looking to drive those fee lines or revenue lines as well.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for that color. And I just want to follow up, I wanted to ask on capital management. Now you have some of
your trust fund peers actually outlined some pretty exclusive capital targets either somewhere in the zone of a
10% to 11% to Tier 1 or 5.5% to 6% Tier 1 leverage target. I know you never want to deviate from the path
despite not being part of the [indiscernible] (00:44:46) cohort and we've seen how strong the capital ratios are, as
we think about the [ph] XVB (00:44:51) framework, potentially this payout restriction getting lifted hopefully in the
not too distant future, how you guys are thinking about the pace of buybacks and capital return when some of
those restrictions are ultimately lifted?

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Now, the – from a capital perspective, in aggregate, you're right, at 12.8% CET1 and at 7.6% on Tier 1 leverage,
we feel strong in terms of – and by any measure in terms of our capital levels. And we certainly, if you think about
our overall payout ratio for last year, it was – and particularly the last three quarters, lower than what we would
have anticipated. But coming into the year and having the ability to get back to stock repurchase, I'm a broken
record on this, but the framework of what are our conversations with the board.
Secondly, what do we think about on an absolute basis and how do we want to ensure we're competing
externally, not just being at strong capital levels, but how does that resonate with very large family office clients or
sovereign wealth funds that look very, very heavily at whether or not they're dealing with financial institutions that
are strong, what do the capital levels look like on a relative basis. So, we can say we're not just strong, but we're
strong relative to our peers.
And then lastly, regulators, very big influence in terms of what they're looking for. And so, that – those – all that is
a mosaic that plays in along with looking at what our return alternatives are as we think about investing in the
business. We talked about what we're doing in terms of digital. We've talked about what we're doing in terms of
building different, more technologically deep operating models for our C&IS business. We've done things within
the asset management business to ensure that we could have the product set and the technology to be a strong
provider of liquidity products that took investment two, three, four years ago.
And you couple all that with looking at what – how we think about the stock on a relative basis from a valuation
perspective. And so, it's not one where we say we're going to go down to 12% or we're going to go down to 7% in
Tier 1 leverage. It really truly is a conversation. We're looking at all of the factors I just mentioned and determining
what's best from a capital perspective.

Hi. Look, you need to spend money to make money. I get it. And your core fee growth is about 500 basis points
better than trust bank peers. But on the other hand, expenses were up across the board. And so, I guess, the first
question is, was there any extra one-time or elevated expenses in the fourth quarter as you onboarded additional

business? And specifically, the punch line, do you expect to have fee growth in 2021 faster than expense growth,
especially with like pricing on a lot of your products?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, on the expense side, there were some one-time items that – the severance charge, $55 million, occupancy,
but specifically related to the new business coming on, the timing of that matters. And clearly, as you bring on
very, very large clients, some of the clients, if it's just a custody mandate, that may not require us bringing on
additional people. If it's investment outsourcing – investment operations outsourcing, then that's going to take
people, and it'll take people upfront in advance so they can get onboarded and trained in advance of us bringing
the assets on and billing.
And so, that can certainly happen. That's the dynamic that – that's why we tend to not think about an absolute
expense growth level because we can have the foresight in looking at what the new business wins are and what
the expense needs are to handle that intra-year, unless it's coming at the very beginning or the very end of the
year. And so, as we look into 2020, and as Mike was hinting at earlier – into 2021 is what Mike was hinting at
earlier, we – our expense experience is going to be driven in very large part based on what we're onboarding, not
just the size of it but the nature of it. I think that's something that is very important for people externally to realize.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, I know you don't always answer this question, but for 2021, do you expect fee growth to be faster than
expense growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I mean that's always – that's the goal. That's in – and that's why we spent a lot of time even this morning talking
about that, that if we have – regardless of where fee growth is, that's how we're testing what the expense growth
is. Now, there are often items on the expense lines that are not related to what the – to bring on new business.
And so, last year, we had to – we brought on $30 million in additional pension expense. That has not – that has to
do with what's the expected return on assets, what's the discount rate. Those are not related. But we actually
highlighted those items last year. We talked about real estate commitments, we talked about pension, and we
talked about base pay adjustment that we'd committed to last year. And this year, as we come into this year,
we're – it's probably noteworthy that we're not saying any of those items. And pension is a million-dollar drag
year-over-year. And I think you can take the occupancy that we had in fourth quarter, strip out the $12 million, and
you get to a decent run rate.
And you should see between comp and ben, you should start to see the rep charges that we talked about start to
bed in to those two line items. And then, the other thing we should expect before we get to new business, the
equipment and software, that's been a faster growth item. And that's likely going to continue as we make sure
we're where we want to be from a digital perspective and outside services. And so, from there, Mike, it comes
down to – from those items, it really comes down to what new business comes onboard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I kind of have a follow-up question. And this is – relates to the question from a couple of questions ago. If
you think of the food chain, and you can correct this framework that I'm going to give you, but from the low end to
16

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
the high end, the low end would be – maybe it's Robinhood or some of these smaller fintechs with a small
amount, huge retail engagement, lots of revenues. Some reports say that New York Stock Exchange volume's
gone from 10% to 20% retail trading. And so that'll be the bottom there. And then you get online broker, you get
mass affluent, you get private banking and you get the family office.
And as you go from left to right, you go from more revenues today, more activity during the pandemic and more
erratic, more lumpy. And when we get to your business, it's a lot more stable, it's annuity-like, but maybe not as
elevated revenues as it is today. So, as you think about the advice business, is it moving more down-market and
do you need to move down-market with it, or you view some of the activity down-market over the past six or nine
months as kind of one-off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Actually, it's a conversation we have a lot internally. And Mike, why don't you...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So I'll start, Mike. First of all, I'd say, I would agree with your framework at a very high level as you think of
that kind of low to high and the characteristics as you move up that spectrum. And you're absolutely right. We are
focused on the upper end of that spectrum. And one point that it highlights is, I'll say, both the importance of
retention but also the benefits of retention. So, I'm not going to speak to turnover or what may happen on the
lower end because, again, that's not where our business is focused. But I can tell you on the higher end, you have
time periods like 2020 where that model of holistic advice and high level of service results in very high levels of
retention. So, excellent year in retention at that level.
But if you said was there a lot of trading activity with that, the answer is no. In fact, as you heard in some of my
opening comments there, that's exactly what we, I would say, counseled our clients against because we're goals-
driven. And so, instead of trading out and then trying to get back in, it resulted in our clients actually doing well
through that because they stuck to their goals-driven framework.
And then to your point of, well, then how do we think about the growth opportunity going forward, there's still a
significant opportunity for us to grow at the upper end of that. So, you put GFO at the top, as Jason pointed out,
that part of the business has been growing at a high rate for us. And again, we think we are differentiated at that
end. And then absolutely, I'll call it, below that with ultra-high net worth, likewise seeing very good growth,
continued growth there and still plenty of opportunities.
Because as much as just kind of leave that lower and decide for the time being, even in the environment that
we're in, there's a tremendous amount of wealth that's being created. That means that there are opportunities for
us, whether that's family businesses being sold or companies going public and the executives being in a position
of having wealth that needs to be managed in a way that we do it.
So, we still feel very good about that part. And it's not to say that we don't service clients that are below that ultra-
high net worth end of the market. And frankly, that's where a lot of the digitalization efforts that we have underway
in wealth will allow us to serve that part of the markets, but in a much more efficient way. And so that will enable
that growth in that part of the market to be more profitable, more scalable.

Hi, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. A bit of a follow-up there. In the past you've mentioned that you're open to acquisitions,
particularly in wealth and intermediary distribution. And I just wanted to understand what level of appetite at this
stage given some of the organic opportunities you have, and then maybe layering onto that capabilities when you
talk about wealth creation, and I'm kind of sitting here thinking about, well, crypto has got a lot of wealth creation
and maybe there's a sleeve there that you could add. So maybe just speak to that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll take that Betsy. It's Mike. So to your point, historically our acquisitions have focused on capabilities, and that's
been across the businesses. So asset management, wealth management and asset servicing, we've done a
number of capability type acquisitions which then we're able to leverage that capability in our business model and
grow, and there's a number of examples of that. For that type of acquisition, you're right. We continue to look at
areas where those types of additions will enable us to further grow with client bases, and importantly in segments
that are growing faster.
So I won't address any one of them in particular. But to your point, that can be a very small either acquisitions or
investments, for example in C&IS where we have a capability that's in an area that has innovative new
technology. And then I would say, more broadly than that as far as just appetite, absolutely, to the extent we find
something that fits strategically and is attractive financially, we're open and interested in doing that. We've done
more, as you know, over time, in C&IS, on the asset servicing side. And I would say, we'd be more interested or
likely to do it in asset management or wealth management.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And just on the crypto side, I mean, there's been some loose competitors adding crypto capabilities, you're talking
about potentially adding it back on your radar screen or to out there?

Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Definitely from a capability perspective, you've seen some of the things that we've announced in order to have the
capability to serve our clients. So to the extent that digital assets continue to grow, and in the sense of used by
not just, call it, personal or retail clients, but also moves more to institutional clients, those are institutions we need
to have the capabilities to serve them. And so yes, both, I would say, on our own, but more importantly partnering
with others to be able to meet those needs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And so does it take a regulatory requiring change at all to do that? I know that OCT recently approved stable
clients for banks, which maybe is a part of the announcement you need. But I'm just wondering, from a regulatory
perspective, is there anything you need from that end to execute on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I would just say, without getting into the specifics around digital assets and the regulatory framework on that,
but it is a component. And so from our perspective, there's a technical or technological aspect of it. There's a
service aspect of it, in another words, how does it fit with other things we're doing for those clients. And then to
your point, there's a regulatory aspect. And then I would also say, there's a financial aspect to it, so how can you
be compensated for the ability to provide, for example, custody for those types of assets.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Yes. Okay. Back to real world deposits, well, I shouldn't say real world, but the bread-and-butter here of
balance sheet. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about managing deposits? I mean, we've
always heard from some folks that bringing on whether it's operating or non-operating deposits and others have
been signaling that they really only want the operating deposits and will discourage non-operating. Can you tell us
what your strategy is there as we think about balance sheet and deposit growth over the next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, with – I'd come back to the capital levels and at 12.8% and maybe more importantly at 7.6% that we've got
room to bring on deposits, and we want our balance sheet to be there for clients. And so when we get – reach out
to clients saying we want to move, and sometimes it's very significant, sometimes it's not millions of dollars or
hundreds, sometimes it's billions of dollars, and for existing long-term clients we want to have capacity to help
them, and we have. In terms of how we deal with it, it's oftentimes they'll let us know that it's episodic. It's them
moving money. They might be liquidating position going somewhere else. And so there's no formula for – and so
we're not going to take two-year duration on reinvesting those deposits. And that said, there's a component where
we do know it's more stable.
And so if you look at the balance sheet, back to press release tables, it's actually – you can look at a handful of
the line items and see how of the deposits that have come in really roughly half has gone to central banks and
stayed short, and about half have gone and been reinvested more in the securities portfolio in one way or
another, not out – if it's an institutional deposit, and it seems from the nature of your question you understand the
different regulatory treatment of the deposits as they come in. And so we have to hold liquidity and capital for

Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, guys. Just a few cleanups here. I think the core tax rate in the quarter is a bit elevated. And you
guys mentioned in the release somewhere in the mix. But any change just how you're thinking about the outlook
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No. In general, we've been able to move some of the cash, if I understand your question, some of the cash down
into the securities portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, on the tax rate to 28% in the quarter versus 24%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thanks. Thank you. Yeah. So the tax rate that was printed was higher. Obviously, if you take that out, you get
back down to 28%. The difference being 28% to 24%, more episodic, it's not something that we think is longer
term. We think 24% is still the right number in the long run. Now, that said, I'll tell you, fourth quarter can be –
even within that 24%, fourth quarter can be a tick higher than the 24%. Usually, you'll have first quarter that's a
little bit lower. And then second, third, fourth quarters for different reasons a tick higher. But 24% over the course
of the year is still a good number in the long run.

Yeah, Mike. It's Mark. A couple of million was basically the number and it's for the types of services that might not
be a recurring thing, estate services, real estate services, that kind of thing. And those were a little bit more
elevated this quarter that helped some of the sequential growth.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, folks. Just maybe on the net interest revenue, just if you could comment the trend into 1Q
given we did see a big spike in deposits, I know that's typical of calendar year end, maybe just to talk about
deposit balances on an average basis, whether they're trending higher into 1Q. And then also on the loan
strategy, but first of all, have the loans fully repriced now given the resets provided there are some that are
lagged? And then just your desire to extend more loans and that trend into 1Q for net interest revenue impacting
to offset the day count and keep NII flat in 1Q versus 4Q.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
At the end as long as you're 85% repriced at this point. As I worked my way back up, and let me know if I miss
part of the question, but locking from fourth quarter to first quarter, the loan balances and deposit balances have
stayed elevated relative to where they were a year ago for sure. But I really want to caution people to look at
fourth quarter, at the fourth quarter end of period, it was a particularly large spike that we had at the end of fourth
quarter. And we did see that spike come down very quickly. And so what's a better predictor is looking at the
average from fourth quarter and the average from fourth quarter to the average so far coming into first quarter. It
seems the deposits are staying elevated at about that level. But just caution you from looking at how at that $171
billion balance sheeted at quarter end.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And given those trends, do you think you could keep NII flat in 1Q and offset the day count? I know there's about
$3 million per day headwind, $3 million to $4 million per day headwind on just the day count.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
That's right. I feel, we've probably given I think what we know at this point, and the drivers from what we just went
through are going to be more how do large families and how do large institutions handle liquidity and what
happens with rates. And I think you guys can monitor, guess at that pretty close to what we can. It's just hard for –
we wanted to be as transparent as possible on this. But there's just uncertainty that comes from what our clients
are doing with their liquidity, and it happens late in the quarter. And so at this point, I feel like the description of
how much of the securities portfolio is rolling off and what the impact of that is probably gives you a starting point
that we have from this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. And then just one on expenses. You talked a lot about it – thanks for all the detail on the plan
to continue to generate positive operating leverage. If I look at the expense trust fee ratio, bad debt and money
market fee waivers, it looks like 103%, which is an improvement from 106% to 107% last year. If you had to
guess, if you just took your normal, your sort of expected organic growth over the long term, and you'd say 8%
equity market returns on an annual basis, and given your expense management plans, on a calendar year basis,
what do you think you might be able to get to parity between expenses and trust fees under those scenarios?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Couple of things. One, it's not necessarily a specific goal to get to 100%. We want to get there, we want to get
going past it, and there's no magic between 101% versus 99%. Secondly, there are so many factors that go into
what you just said and what type of business is coming in from a trust fee perspective, how much it is driven by
markets, are we growing from investment operations outsourcing versus custody versus wealth. And so that's why
we've tried to give you a good launch point on expenses, and then give very firm dynamics of what the key drivers
are. But that's probably where we should leave what our predictions are over the course of the longer periods of
time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Jim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Hey, good morning. Hey. Okay. So maybe if you could just give us a sense of – we've talked, we all kind of know
what the downside risks are in NII, and I think if we just exclude the idea of the Fed raising rates maybe we could
just speak to what other drivers could be more positive, I guess, for NII going forward? Is it kind of a steepening in
the middle of the curve? Is it mortgage rates and the impact on premium NM or is it loan growth? Just trying to
think through how we should think about upside risks to NII over the next 12 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So you hit on – I think two of those three examples are the big ones. And if you get – right now, if you look
at the yield curve, it's interesting, there's not been any movement out for kind of overnight through two years. And
so it hasn't really helped us. But if you look out farther kind of 5% to 10%, that's where you've seen the lift. But
we're not buying a lot in between there in that space. And so if we have some of that steepness start to come not
even overnight, but if it starts to hit, two, three, four years, that starts to change things. And then secondly, loan
growth. You think about the difference we have in yield, in loans, versus even the securities portfolio, let alone
Central Bank deposits, really, really large. So those are really the two big items.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q

No, it makes sense. Very helpful. Thanks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. First question, on expenses. I guess, in the quarter, is there still any trailing impacts from COVID
that would have impacted the numbers this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It's slowed down a lot. We've had some items early, and by the way, it goes both ways. I mean, please remember
travel is – and I tried to highlight it in the opening comments by pausing more, but the business promotion
expenses being down, that's COVID-related, and that's material, and that'll start to revert hopefully as things open
back up again. And then there are also other savings, even cleaning millions of square feet of office space that
we've been able to save. And so with that said, the flipside to it is that we've continued to make investments on
the resiliency environment that Mike hinted to in his opening comments. And so that means getting fresh
equipment in the hands of existing partners. It means making sure that the technology package that new partners
have, it enables them to work on a work-from-home basis that's more consistent. And so that said, I don't think
those investments at this point – and those investments, those aren't tens of millions of dollars. The one area that
you might connect to this is that, we want to make sure that our technology because of being in a resiliency mode,

we're continuing this journey of ensuring we're doing a lot from a technology perspective. And we do link that
somewhat to being in this resiliency period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then a separate question on the loan growth. I mean, a lot of the peers were seeing down loans in the quarter
and just deleveraging in general. You're seeing your loans hold in. I guess what's the driver of the loan growth
there, and can you kind of expect loan growth to continue to improve as you look out to 2021? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, a couple things I mentioned earlier that we have been spending more – so it is deliberate in conversations
we're having with clients letting them know that our balance sheet is here for them. And part of it is the nature
likely of our clients starting to see that light at the end of the tunnel and starting to make more investments in
different ways. So it's hard to – it's very difficult to predict whether or not that increase is going to continue to
develop over time or accelerate. I would say, it hasn't declined. And even at the end of the – even coming after –
looking at where numbers were at year end to where they have been just in the first two or three weeks of the
year, I think the risk could decline. And it's hard to say this too confidently, but the risk of decline is low. We feel
better about it stabilizing and hoping that it continues to increase somewhat. But we've had very stable loans for a
long period of time, and it's hard to see an environment where it goes up by several billions of dollars. We're
talking about $1 billion or $2 billion has significant impact on our overall loan volumes.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Okay. Thanks, Mike, Jason and Mark. First one, just a little clarification on a couple of the items you
mentioned for the quarter. The fee waivers, Jason, you've said $35 million. You're almost re-priced at the
moment. But what was that in 4Q compared to the $35 million? Was that fully – was that $35 million number for
the fourth quarter also or is that currently and what was it for – what's that change? And another question that you
had on the items you mentioned, the true-ups, 2.5%, the growth from true-ups, that's about $10 million. Never
really seen $10 million positive, generally you all tend to have it on the negative side. What kind of true-up was
this that was positive? Was it a contract terminated early that you got paid by the client, or – can you give some
color on that?

Sure. Well, fee waivers in fourth quarter were $23.5 million. But Mark, maybe it's better for you to explain the true-
ups in C&IS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I think you're referring to the comment that Jason made about some of the nonrecurring type of organic
growth. So I wouldn't – not necessarily a true-up or an adjustment per se, but transaction volumes were higher
during the quarter. And then we also have certain types of services that we might be doing for clients that are
billed based on the periods that we're doing them at. So those are the kinds of, I would say, non-recurring fees
once they come online. There was also some true-ups that might happen from a quarter-to-quarter, but not – don't
want you to think that there was a one $10 million item like that. It was more of kind of an aggregation of the types
of fees that we see that might be a little more episodic than just the kind of recurring fees that we see each
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And Mike, I have a bigger picture question for you. The new business that you're seeing and Mike, just the $13.5
trillion that you have in your CIS, the strong growth you've seen there, what client types are you seeing? That
$13.5 trillion, how would you break that down, firstly, in terms of mutual funds versus pension versus insurance, et
cetera, and hedge funds obviously? And where have you seen more of that growth, the strong growth you've seen
recently?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So Vivek, it's Mike. So I'd start off by just answering your question. Yes, it is across all of those groups if you
broke down the $13 trillion. As far as growth, it's interesting because as you look across the globe, at least for us,
in 2020, we had stronger asset growth on the asset owner side in North America. And that just relates to having a
large business there in the US, also in Canada, and having nice growth during the year. But if you look at EMEA
and the APAC region, the growth was more from asset managers. So, for example, in APAC, specifically
Australia, strong growth with asset managers there, which, for us, is I would say a nice positive because that
business started off years ago primarily focused on asset owners with the strategy over time similar to what we've
done in other geographies to then build out the asset manager services. And so that's gone well. And as I
mentioned, in EMEA, the growth with asset managers primarily being driven in Luxembourg and Ireland where,
again, we've made investments to grow those businesses over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And what percentage of your assets on the trustee would you say of the $13.5 trillion was North America versus
EMEA versus APAC and any sort of -
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. This is Mark. So the geography breakdown, we'll have in our 10-K. I don't have that right in front of me. And
it's hard even looking at the assets just because of the assets aren't going to be necessarily equally driving the
fees. So a large custody mandate might have lower fees than a smaller fund mandate. So if we looked at the fees
themselves, you're looking at, across the regions, almost 40% to 45% EMEA, and similar in Americas and then
APAC growing quite a bit. And then when you look at asset owners versus asset managers, when you look at the
25

asset servicing fee, that too about 60%, 40% or so at this point, asset managers. So the assets though – it's not
always an easy comparison just looking at the assets because that doesn't necessarily translate through to the
P&L.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, everyone. Thank you. Mike, can you share with us or maybe Jason, obviously, this year has been – or this
past year has been unprecedented. We all know that. With the Federal Reserve taking in its balance sheet to just
about $7 trillion, and many of your private wealth and corporate customers building up their liquidity, which led to
that incredible deposit growth, you and your peers have seen this in this past year. Can you lay out a scenario
where the deposits start to come down? I knew they're not going to come down anyway. But if you look out over
the next two years, when will you start to see that change and maybe deposits start to run off the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So Gerard, to your point, difficult to predict something like that at a very high macro level. And Jason indicated
this earlier, where we do see the assets begin to move, and it would be true both on the balance sheet but also
within the funds, within the money market funds, is where our clients, which I think is a good proxy for a certain
part of the market, want to deploy those funds in other ways. And so to the extent – and I think you're already
seeing that in the increasing values in other markets, right. So equity obviously has done quite well. Well, that's
more buyers and sellers as they say, and some of that's coming from liquidity where they're earning anywhere
from zero to negative depending on the jurisdiction. And they're saying, well, I need to move into riskier assets.
And so that's gradually what's happening, absent what the Central Banks will do.
And so to your point, at this point, the Central Banks have kind of said, they're going to stay where they are for an
extended time period. So that would indicate you would expect these trends to continue. And then once they
begin to shift, similar to the rise in liquidity, you would expect to see a decrease in liquidity, and that would then
flow backwards, I'll call it, through the system.

Very good. And then second, there's been talk on your call today as well as some of your peers about all the
different types of wealth managers and asset managers in the system. Can you guys talk about pricing pressure?
Do you find that there's pricing pressure in different client categories, or no – you really don't see it because of the
product offerings that you've got as well as your reputation of being one of the high quality wealth managers in the
country?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So there is pricing or fee pressure across all of our businesses. And that has been consistent for some time
period. Now, does it ebb and flow at different time periods given other dynamics within one of our businesses, for
example, or even within one of the services? Yes, but if you just start with the concept of fee pressure is there,
and it's our expectation that that will continue. Now, on the other side of it, to your point what is our competitive
positioning, and we very much are focused on providing a differentiated service across each of our businesses.
And in doing so our intent is to be able to offset the market fee pressure. Now, whether you can offset all of it or
not, again, it depends on many factors. But we are looking to have a differentiated offering in the marketplace and
not be commoditized as much as possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And the fee pressure is built on the institutional business as well as the personal, or is it more on the customer
institution business as we go see?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's across the board. And again, depending on the service or the product you can have more or less. But I
would say it's across the board.

Hi there. Great. Thanks very much for the follow up. Just one last one on the balance sheet. On the lending
strategy, Jason, you mentioned the balance sheet is there for the clients. Is there a change in thinking on the
lending side, are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients in particular in terms of their desire to either
borrow more to fund projects or to benefit from the lower rates or other cash needs, and are you more willing in
the past to extend those loans? And then how do you think, in terms of the size of the balance sheet, how you're

thinking about share repurchase given that you are now allowed to buy back up quarterly average net income for
the first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
On the loan question, most importantly, there's not been a change in our risk appetite or risk strategy. I'd say, if
anything, it's just been a change in an intensification of our communications strategy with our clients about being
here for them, and then being willing to be supportive as they have liquidity needs. And the credit portfolio is held
in extremely well obviously. And then you look at charge-offs or de minimis over the course of 2020, and non-
performings crept up a tiny bit in fourth quarter, but still very, very low levels, less than 40 basis points, I think, in
the portfolio. And our watchlist actually declined for the period. So everything there looks good. It's been – but that
said, the bankers are intensifying their communication with clients about our lending capacity and willingness.
And so that's really the driver. And then as we think about the capacity of the balance sheet, the size of it,
certainly not something that we're actively looking to change in any way. We obviously take the fact that we now
have the ability to go back and do share repurchase seriously. It's something we've already started engaging with
our board on so that we can, at the appropriate time, be back in the market within the framework that I described
earlier. But it's not something where we'd say, we're trying to increase or decrease the size of the balance sheet
or the capital level. It's not going to be monumental change from – the fact that we were out of the market is not
going to drive monumental change in how we think about the capital levels.
