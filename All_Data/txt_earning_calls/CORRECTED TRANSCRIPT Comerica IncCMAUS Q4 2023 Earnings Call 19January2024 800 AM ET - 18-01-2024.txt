Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Although 2023 was challenging for
our industry, we felt it was a year of achievement. Following industry disruption, we protected relationships,
stabilized deposits, maintained strong credit quality, enhanced our capital, and took steps to position our business
for future success. In fact, we delivered record average loans and record net interest income.
Despite the marketplace instability, we advanced key strategic initiatives and received impressive recognition for
our results. Small business, to highlight, as we initiated a national expansion effort, delivered award-winning
products, and achieved our three-year lending goal ahead of schedule. Non-interest income remained a priority
as we launched targeted initiatives aimed at enhancing our products and increasing our mix of capital efficient
income.
Although the economic environment remains uncertain, we observed a cautiously more optimistic trend in
customer sentiment at year end as we believe many expect less rate pressure in 2024. We remain committed to
supporting our customers and feel we are positioned to grow alongside them as the economy strengthens.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Full year financial highlights are on slide 4. With 7% growth, we produced our highest level of average annual
loans despite the impact of deliberate optimization efforts in the second half of the year. Deposits remained a
targeted focus, and we were pleased to see stabilization following the industry events and ongoing quantitative
tightening. We delivered record net interest income aided by higher rates and loan balances. Credit quality
remained strong with net charge-offs well below historical averages. In all, it was a strong quarter for the
company, and we ended with a good fourth quarter.
Since there were a number of notable items in this quarter's results, I'm going to hand the call to Jim to discuss
those upfront and provide context for the remainder of the presentation. Jim?

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 details the notable items Curt referenced, most of which were
furnished in an 8-K earlier this month. As previously announced, we recorded $109 million in non-interest
expenses related to the one-time special FDIC assessment. This was unchanged from indications provided in our
December update.
Next was the accounting impact from the pending cessation of BSBY since approximately $7 billion of our swap
portfolio was designated to BSBY loans. The announcement impacted our ability to maintain hedge accounting for
that portion of the portfolio and resulted in a net non-cash loss of $88 million. The key message is that cessation
does not result in an economic impact, only a change in the time recognition of earnings. These recognized
losses will accrete back, and the normal course pay received cash settlements and earnings recognition on the
swaps remain uninterrupted. While the realization of losses flowed through to our regulatory capital ratios, they
did not further impact tangible common equity or tangible book value. Also, note, operationally and from a
customer perspective, we feel well prepared for a seamless transition.
Third in the list were $25 million in severance charges, which elevated fourth quarter non-interest expenses and
were intended to enhance future earnings power and create capacity for investment. We previously signaled such
efforts were being considered, and we will discuss them in more detail later in the presentation.
The last item does not impact bottom line results, but created line item geography changes within our income
statement. The finalization of our agreement with Ameriprise to serve as our new investment platform provider
caused a decline in non-interest income, offsetting a decline in non-interest expenses. While relatively small
impact in late 2023, we noted here because we expect a larger impact in 2024.
Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Overall, the quarter performed in line with expectations, excluding
notable items. Considering the impact of those items, I'm going to move to the individual line item slides to
discuss quarterly results in more detail.
Turning to slide 7, our intentional balance sheet management reduced average loans and commitments in the
fourth quarter. The exit of Mortgage Banker Finance contributed to almost half of the reduction in average
balances. At year end, approximately $250 million in loans remained in that business. Muted customer demand
due to elevated rates impacted general Middle Market balances, while increased selectivity prioritizing for
relationships and higher returns reduced loans in Equity Fund Services and Corporate Banking.
Ongoing funding of multi-family and industrial construction projects continued to drive higher commercial real
estate utilization, but commitments declined for the second consecutive quarter as we strategically managed

pipeline and originations. The floating rate nature of our commercial loan portfolio benefited from higher rates as
loan yields continued to climb to 6.38% in the fourth quarter.
Slide 8 highlights the stability of our deposit base. Average deposit balances remained relatively flat to the third
quarter at $66 billion, even with declines of $564 million in brokered time deposits and $176 million related to the
exit of Mortgage Banker Finance. Growth in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking reflects seasonal
patterns, while Retail benefited modestly from promotional campaigns. Declines in National Dealer Services
deposits were attributed to operations, consistent with inventory and utilization trends observed in that business.
Non-interest-bearing balances performed in line with expectations, and the pace of decline continued to flatten.
Ongoing success in growing interest-bearing deposits grew up to over 42% non-interest-bearing deposit mix,
which we continue to view as a competitive advantage. Industry competition, the rate environment, and
successful promotional campaigns drove deposit costs higher to 312 basis points, resulting in a cumulative beta
of 58% in the fourth quarter. Our deposit profile has historically been a strength, and with our favorable mix,
operating nature of our accounts and uninsured trends, we feel it is even more compelling.
As shown on slide 9, we continue to normalize our liquidity position using excess cash to repay wholesale funding
while retaining significant capacity. We absorbed $1.2 billion in maturing FHLB advances and allowed over $500
million in brokered time deposits to mature in the quarter. We expect decisions on future wholesale funding
maturities to follow the normal course monitoring of balance sheet dynamics and funding needs. At 78%, our
loan-to-deposit ratio remained favorable and positions us to prioritize high return loan growth going forward.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on slide 10 increased approximately $550 million as paydowns and
maturities were more than offset by a $975 million positive mark-to-market adjustment from rate movements late
in the quarter. Treasury maturities and anticipated securities repayments are projected to benefit net interest
income and AOCI, and we anticipate a 25% improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years.
Turning to slide 11. Net interest income decreased $17 million to $584 million driven by higher rates and deposit
mix as volume changes related to loans, deposits and wholesale funding were largely offset by lower balances at
the Fed. Successful execution of our balance sheet optimization strategy has allowed us to reduce wholesale
funding and enhance margin.
As shown on slide 12, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet
positions us favorably for a gradual 100 basis points or 50 basis points on average decline in interest rates. Of
note, BSBY cessation did not impact the ongoing cash flow associated with their swaps listed on the slide. While
we took a loss in the fourth quarter, we will accrete that loss back with the majority coming back into net interest
income in 2025 and 2026. We expect the impact in 2024 to be relatively muted, although there may be some
mark-to-market volatility until we fully re-designate remaining impacted swaps to SOFR. By strategically
managing our swap and securities portfolio, while considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to maintain our
insulated position over time.
Credit quality remains strong, as highlighted on slide 13. Modest net charge-offs of 15 basis points remain below
our normal range, and the few we had were more concentrated in relatively higher risk portfolios. We observed
some normalization in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking as rates pressured customer profitability.
These normalization trends drove the slight increase in the allowance for credit losses to 1.40% of total loans.
Non-performing assets increased but still remained historically low. Overall, our portfolio continued to perform as
expected, and we believe migration will remain manageable.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
On slide 14, fourth quarter non-interest income of $198 million included $93 million in notable items. Excluding the
impact of these items and an increase in deferred compensation, which was offset in expenses, non-interest
income performed in line with guidance. While we continue to expect non-customer income in 2024 to come down
from elevated 2023 levels, we remain committed to investments to drive capital efficient fee growth over time.
Expenses on slide 15 included $132 million in notable items. Beyond those items, increases in salaries and
benefits reflected the impact of higher deferred compensation offset within non-interest income. Increased
consulting expenses are attributed to advancing strategic and risk management initiatives, and a smaller gain on
the sale of real estate in the fourth quarter had the net impact of increasing expenses.
Moving to slide 16. We previously communicated an intention to address growing expense pressures and the
structural impact to industry profitability from 2023 events. In addition to our normal efficiency efforts, this slide
details incremental actions to recalibrate expenses in support of investments and enhanced earnings. Through
this process, we are prioritizing customers and positioning the business for future success. Complementing efforts
already underway to rationalize real estate, we initiated a plan to further reduce our physical footprint, including
the closure of 26 banking centers where we assessed nominal customer impact.
In order to enhance colleague efficiency and keep decision makers close to our customers, we are streamlining
our management structure and eliminating select roles. When combined with the impact of banking center
closures, these actions eliminated approximately 250 positions. Further, we are optimizing our product offering to
enhance capital efficiency and returns, and select contracts are being reviewed for renegotiation. In total, these
actions have the effect of reducing expected 2024 expenses by $45 million, growing to an estimated benefit of
$55 million in 2025. These decisions are challenging and we do not take them lightly, but we feel they are
necessary to support the sustainable growth of our business
Slide 17 highlights our solid capital position. Even with the impact of notable items, our estimated CET1 grew to
11.09%. Rate movement, coupled with continuous paydowns and maturities in our securities portfolio, reduced
losses within AOCI and increased tangible common equity to 6.30%. Based on the December 31 forward curve,
we expect our unrealized losses to reduce by one-third by the end of 2025. Although the proposed capital
changes do not apply to us based on our asset size, we favor a conservative approach to capital management
and plan to monitor ongoing AOCI volatility and regulations as they evolve.
Our outlook for 2024 is on slide 18. We project full year average loans to decline 1% to 2%, impacted by
optimization trends late in 2023. While we expect some impact of selectivity to continue into the first quarter, we
anticipate 5% loan growth from December-to-December with contributions from almost all businesses. Full year
average deposits are expected to be down 1% to 2% from 2023, but we project relative stability point-to-point.
Following a seasonal decline in the first quarter, we expect customer deposits to stabilize and rebound in the
second half of the year.
Based on the 12/31 forward curve, we expect full year net interest income to decline 11% from 2023 driven
largely by year-over-year deposit mix. We expect deposit seasonality and, to a lesser extent, less income from
BSBY re-designation, slightly higher deposit betas, and lower loan balances to impact first quarter net interest
income. From there, we expect a small uptick in the second quarter and more pronounced growth in the second
half of the year.
As it relates to BSBY hedge accounting, interest rates and timing of re-designation could create volatility, but we
expect to eliminate most or all of that potential volatility from transition of indexes by the end of the first quarter.

Credit quality remains strong, and we expect continued migration to be manageable. We forecast full year net
charge-offs to move into the lower half of our normal 20 to 40 basis point range.
We expect non-interest income to grow 6% on a reported basis, which would be relatively flat year-to-year when
adjusting for notable items. As we signaled last quarter, we expect FHLB dividends, price alignment income from
hedges and BOLI to decline from elevated levels. Customer income is expected to increase modestly, with growth
in fiduciary and capital markets and deposit service charges, partially offset by pressures in card, commercial
lending fees, and the assumption that favorable mark-to-market derivative adjustments do not repeat.
Full year non-interest expenses are expected to decline 4% on a reported basis, but grow 3% after adjusting for
notable items. Through successful execution of our expense recalibration efforts, we believe we have created
capacity to prioritize investments designed to further enhance our funding base, revenue mix, and capital
efficiency, as well as risk management framework. Even with 5% projected point-to-point loan growth, we expect
to maintain capital well in excess of our 10% target. We will continue to monitor AOCI volatility and the evolving
regulatory environment as we evaluate the right time to resume share repurchases.
In all, we are proud of our year, and we feel we've taken the right actions to support the future of our business.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Despite the industry volatility in 2023, we think it is important to take a step back and reinforce
that our core business remained unchanged, as shown on slide 19. As a leading bank for business with strong
wealth management and retail capabilities, our tenured colleagues deliver value-added expertise to our
impressive customer base. Our highly regarded approach to credit continue to perform well and has historically
outperformed our peers.
Tailored products are designed to meet the needs of our customers, enhancing revenue and retention. Our
deposit profile has long been a strength, and investments in products and small business are expected to make
this core funding source even more compelling. Actions to recalibrate our expense base are designed to benefit
our future. And at well over 10% strategic capital target, we believe we have a strong foundation.
In August, we will celebrate our 175th anniversary. You do not achieve that kind of longevity without proving time
and time again that you can successfully navigate disruptions. In 2023, our motto proved resilient. Our colleagues
rallied to support our customers through an uncertain time, and we delivered record results. As we look forward
into this milestone anniversary year for our company, I'm confident in our ability to deliver for our customers,
colleagues, and shareholders.
We appreciate your time this morning and would be happy to take some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question is coming from Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Good morning. So there's been a lot of focus this earnings season on kind of a normalized margin
range. I'm just wondering what you – as some of these swaps mature, what the margin could get back to. Do you
think it could get back to those pre-COVID levels in the 3.50% range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Peter. As you may know and recall, I don't like to get real specific on margin. I think this
quarter is a great example of that where we actually had a decrease in net interest income, but we had an
increase in NIM. So a bank with our business model where you had some lumpiness, you can get those
correlations that don't match up. But I do see NIM trending in a very good direction. We ticked up this quarter.
We will have a little bit of a tick down next quarter as the first quarter guidance would imply, based on the
percentage growth that we put in the outlook. But then we see a steady climb from there. I do see us by the end
of 2024 actually getting above where this past fourth quarter was. And then we continue to traject up from there
throughout 2025 as we have swaps and securities roll off, and we get into a more normalized environment.
So I do see a lot of momentum building for us in the second half of this year, and I see that momentum actually
accelerating as we move through 2025. And of course, that's exclusive of the BSBY hedge accounting impact.
We're actually going to have significant income added to 2025 on top of the factors that I just talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thanks, Jim. And then just to follow up, you had really nice growth in the CET1 ratio. And even adjusted for
AOCI, you're above the minimum 7% threshold. I'm just wondering, you mentioned in the prepared remarks
looking at AOCI. But what are some of the parameters you're looking for to resume share buybacks? And then
how much capital do you accrete on a quarterly basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Peter, number one, I do think we're on a very good track to comply with Basel III Endgame rules, should
they end up applying to us. But with that said, we do have a little bit of flexibility based on the fact that we are in
pretty good shape there. The number one thing that I continue to keep an eye on is AOCI. It did come down
significantly this quarter. Let's keep in mind, it came down after a number of quarters being more elevated. And

then – since then, rates have ticked back up again. So I don't want to declare a victory yet on the AOCI front for
us as well as the whole industry.
I mean, it looks like things are going in a good direction, and we're certainly going to be in very solid shape to
comply with any capital rules. But before we start the share repurchase up again, I would put AOCI at the top of
the list that we want to keep our eye on to make sure that doesn't tick the other direction again, a little more line of
sight into what the overall economic environment is from an interest rate standpoint and just overall uncertainty
standpoint.
But it does appear we are going to be in shape at some point to start the share repurchase. But we want to be
cautious. And we will be cautious this year. Certainly, in the first half of the year, we won't be active in share
repurchase. We'll keep our options open in the second half of the year. But I'll say that even there, we will likely
be cautious unless we get a better line of sight in terms of interest rates and overall economic stability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And how much capital do you accrete roughly on a quarterly basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, it's going to depend on the quarter and the year and what's going on in the economy. I can tell you that in
2024, we will likely not accrete a lot of capital, maybe a tad bit above where we ended the year, but with 5% point-
to-point growth, even though we're going to have, I think, strong earnings next year, I don't think you're going to
see us significantly above where we ended the fourth quarter. But I think as you move into 2025, you're going to
start seeing some nice accretion from that point on.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. I wanted to ask on your loan-to-deposit ratio. It ticked down again in the quarter to about
78%. I get that you're looking for 5% loan growth point-to-point next year, and you might be bringing in deposits
ahead of that. But I guess, if the loan growth is contingent on rates coming down, why pay out for deposits now?
Why not bring in the deposits later as the loan growth comes in? And what is the right loan-to-deposit ratio to
consider as we look out into the end of 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Manan, this is Curt. I might start and then ask Jim or Peter to add in. But on the deposit front, maybe just to keep
the perspective here is that, we consider deposits part of full relationships with clients. And we have clients for
whom we have lending relationships and clients for whom we have deposit relationships and clients for whom we
have both. But in the case of growing deposits, we're going to grow deposits sort of in line or taking care of our
customers.
And having lived through what the whole industry lived through last spring, I don't believe this is an environment
where we're going to turn any deposits away, for lack of a better definition. We do believe that that loan-to-deposit
ratio will go up some, but we should be able to comfortably stay within our target, we believe, kind of in the mid-
80s even with the point-to-point growth that we're expecting in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Two points I would add on to that, Manan. I mean, we love deposits and regardless of loans. I mean, we're
making money on these deposits. We're not holding capital on them. We love cap – we love deposits just for what
they represent amongst themselves. But having said that, we certainly don't want to operate in a just-in-time
funding capacity for loans. I mean, we want to make sure we're prepared for when that loan comes. You can't
necessarily turn deposits on on a dime. But we welcome the deposits. We're not going to turn them away. We're
making money on them. And they continue to add to the stability of the overall franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And maybe a follow-up there on deposits. As rates start to go down, given your skew to commercial, how
should we think about those deposit betas on the way down? If we do get the six rate cuts or even more than that
as we as we get into 2025, do you think the first few rate cuts are more beneficial given your skew to commercial?
Or should you start to see more momentum in deposit costs coming down as you get into rate cut numbers four,
five, and six?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Every cycle is different, so it's hard to say for sure. But I think in this particular cycle, we could see a little bit
of symmetry or what I might call LIFO approach, last in, first out. I mean, certainly we saw betas accelerate
towards the end of the cycle. And even in the last couple of quarters without Fed hikes, we've seen deposits
continue to tick up. And so, just as we've seen them more accelerated in the second half of the cycle, I think those
might be the most sensitive deposits that we can take back down early in the following rate cycle.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
So I am somewhat cautiously optimistic. We are assuming in the outlook about a 60% beta with not too big of a
lag following those rate cut. Having said that, every cycle is different, and I do recall back in 2019 the Fed cut 50
bps, I believe, in July of 2019, and I didn't see a lot of falling rates in the industry overall. That was a very
controlled environment where the economy was still relatively strong. And I continue to think that the reason for
the Fed cuts is really going to drive that beta.
If it's a very orderly take down of rates and the economy continues to be very strong, it may be a little stickier to
bring them down. But if the Fed reduces rates because there is a little weakening in the economy, I think that gets
banks a little bit more leverage. So I would just emphasize that every cycle is different. But we do think there is
that potential for some significant beta in those first few cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And do you have what percentage of your deposits are directly indexed to the Fed funds rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Most of our deposits are not. We're very much a relationship-based bank. And many of those are one-on-one
conversations with customers. So, we do have some reciprocal deposits that are considered to be somewhat
indexed. Obviously, the brokered deposits, their time deposits are somewhat indexed, you could consider. But the
vast majority of our deposits are not.

Good morning. Good morning. First question just around the loan growth expectation, the 5% point-to-point
expectation, could you give us a little bit of color where do you see the loan growth drivers coming from? And
when do you really see an acceleration there in overall loan growth as you look through 2024? Thank you.

Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
John, this is Peter. So it's actually pretty broad based. I mean, we mentioned this morning, we still have a little bit
of Mortgage Banker Finance at the end of December that will be working against us a little bit through the year.

But then, across the rest of our businesses, it's pretty broad based. I do think – I think dealer probably has sort of
momentum going into 2024 that'll continue throughout the year. Our EFS business, I think, is a business that if
you kind of look in the Appendix we've shown, has dropped a couple of quarters. I think it'll probably drop first
quarter, but we think it'll pick up quite a bit going into 2024.
But really broad based across Middle Market, we feel like we've got some really good momentum. I would tell you
that we feel like customer sentiment changed a little bit in the fourth quarter in the right direction and sort of our
informal surveys that we do internally with everything seems to indicate that there's going to be some more
demand as we get into, what I would really say, the second quarter, to answer your question, probably second,
third quarter is where I think we'll start to see that pick up.
As we talk about today, our outlook on first quarter is pretty flat to down a little bit. But I think as we get into the
middle of the year, we're getting indications that we'll start to see some real good loan growth that results in that
5% point-to-point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Great. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, your guidance implies, call it ballpark, about 900
basis points or so of core negative operating leverage based upon the midpoints of the guide. And I'm just
wondering if the revenue picture ends up being more pressured than you currently forecast, do you have expense
flexibility to improve that operating leverage. I know you set out the $45 million in expense reduction from the
recalibration in 2024. Can that recalibration benefit that $45 million? Can that go up if revenue is pressured to a
greater degree? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
John, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, that $45 million becomes $55 million on a run rate basis in 2025. And
this is an interesting period of time. The whole industry has gone through an inflection in 2023 and somewhat of a
recalibration, to use your words. We've tried to be thoughtful in terms of balancing the things that we believe are
driving revenue for us and will drive revenue for us going forward. That includes some of the products that we've
invested in, especially in treasury management, payments, capital markets, wealth management. It also includes
the focus on small business, expansion into new markets into the Southeast and into the mountain West Colorado
region. And so we want to stay focused on those because we're trying to really play the long game here and try to
get beyond sort of the immediate environment that we're operating in.
And then secondly, I would say while we did have some expense initiatives in the quarter, we're always thinking
about additional efficiency opportunities. And, again, it's all about sort of balancing between those two.
And so my hope is that we would see positive operating leverage really based on overall revenue growth and a
return to a more normalized interest rate environment and hopefully, a soft landing on the economy and a lack of
further credit deterioration, et cetera. If we don't see that, then obviously, we need to think about what else we can
do from an efficiency standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
All right. Thank you. And just regarding that, when do you expect you could break into more of a positive
operating leverage trajectory?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. John, it's Jim. I mean, number one, just to build on Curt's comments, I do think 2024 is a bit of a transition
year, not just for us, but for the whole industry. I think you're hearing that from some of the other calls, too. We're
in this kind of tweener stage where interest rates continue or pay rates and deposits continue to edge up a little
bit, yet the Fed isn't raising rates. So that makes it a really challenging year.
I do think things will start to move in the positive operating leverage direction in 2025. We don't have a complete
line of sight into that yet, but I mentioned how we expect net interest income to really have some great momentum
as we enter into 2025. And of course, that's always the goal to have a positive operating leverage.
And on the topic of expenses, I'll just add that I think that really is a journey, not a destination. We always have to
be looking at expenses. I don't think this will be the end of taking a really hard look at what we can do over time.
And I think if expense reduction is really – having a purpose for twofold. One is to create capacity for investment,
which continues to be critically important, probably more so now than ever. And then secondly, to make sure we
get that positive operating leverage.
So we will continue to kind of keep an eye on not just normal budget hygiene, but actually seeing what more
significant steps we can take over time. So, as I said, a journey, not a destination. And I think 2025 should have
things moving in the better direction. But again, not a complete line of sight into that.

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Jon. Yeah. We did assume the 12/31 forward curve, which has almost six rate cuts in it.
You'll notice on our asset sensitivity page that for the first time that I can recall, at least, we became liability
sensitive. So I think this is a very fortuitous time for us to become liability sensitive with potentially six rate cuts out
into the future. We do have the sensitivities there using a 60% beta.
You can see that we do benefit from falling rates, assuming that we can reprice as expected without too much of
a lag. So I would say if we get fewer cuts than that, that will put a little pressure on that outlook. But we are
benefiting from the 12/31 curve if we really do get those six cuts. So that's the assumption. And we'll continue to
monitor. And we'll see where the economy and where the FOMC goes.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay. Yeah. A lot going on this morning. I had to rub my eyes when I saw that slide. I guess, one of my follow-up

no at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's what our models would say. You never know how customers are going to react and the competition is
going to react. But I would say we are a little more liability sensitive than we are asset sensitive. Now, that liability
sensitive could have a little bit more of a lag in it than what we're projecting. We just don't know how customers
and competition will react. But over the course of time, it does appear that we are a little more liability sensitive.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Curious how elevated is that relative to normal? I don't know if there is a normal, but how elevated is that? And
what does it take for those to come back down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, not surprisingly, but a positive surprise this quarter was that we actually
saw improvement in three of the four incremental monitoring portfolios. So we saw balances and criticized assets
go down in TLS, leveraged, and automotive production. I would say that that leverage portfolio at 10% to 12% is
about normal. That is an elevated higher risk portfolio by its very design. TLS, again, is going to be elevated
above the normal portfolio at 18%. I would say that's still above sort of historical norm, but we are seeing positive
momentum in TLS. Certainly, the rate environment, if it cooperates with the forward curve, is going to be a real
positive for that segment as well as leverage.
You didn't ask about commercial real estate specifically, but we did see that one relatively flat in the fourth
quarter. So we've got some assets that are moving into the criticized bucket, but we also have assets that are
moving out of the criticized bucket. And they move out when they either pay off or we re-margin them and get
them back into a conforming state. So I feel really good about all of those portfolios that are listed there on the
right and would expect that we should – again, if the rate environment cooperates and we don't see a downturn in
the economy, that we'll continue to see these stable to potentially improving towards the back half of the year.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. So I want to start by going back to your answer to Peter's question, the first question on NIM. And
it's funny, for all the years I've covered the company, I think you were the most asset sensitive. And if you look at
the historical NIM range, it's literally all over the place. And Jim, what you've done now is you've basically
restructured the balance sheet, so it's fairly neutral. Even if I look at this 100 basis point gradual at 60% beta, it's
like 6 bp or so benefit to NIM.
So assuming that we get here, let's say the forward curve plays out, we go to 100 basis points or so of steepness,
does that imply your NIM, the new NIM for Comerica is like 3%, right? Historically, I mean, a year ago you were
3.74% [indiscernible] (00:40:32). I'm trying to figure out like, what the hell does the margin look like at this
company with this balance sheet in a normal rate environment that has actual steepness to the curve? And I know
you're basically a 3% margin bank now because you've taken away the asset sensitivity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
We have bounced around quite a bit over time, Steven, and we didn't necessarily think that was always a great
thing. I do think stability is important. The rate environment is one factor. Again, just the overall construction of the
balance sheet and the lumpiness and the amount of cash we're carrying or securities we're carrying is also a
factor. And just, again, our business model creates a little bit more lumpiness in that regard. So we would like a
little bit more stability.
As I mentioned in the Peter's question, I do see our trajectory going north of where we ended here. And I think
we'll continue to go north as we move through 2025. So, we're above 3% on a normalized basis. And I think we
are going to have a much more stable NIM and net interest income earnings capacity going forward. Don't
necessarily want to give an exact number, but it is north of 3% for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. But keep in mind, that's why generalists don't put their money in regional banks
because the [ph] black box and the manager don't (00:41:54) really help shed some light on what expectations
are. I want to ask on expenses, too. So you guys are guiding to around 3% operating expense growth in 2024,
and that's with the benefit of the new initiatives. Just a big picture view, why is expense growth at the company so
much higher than other regionals? I'm sure you look at all the other regionals. It's higher. Then if we think about
2025, if you don't announce another initiative, should we expense the growth rate to lift off of 3%? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Many of the expenses that we have in 2024, a lot of the investment we're making, is not ongoing run rate. A lot of
it's more one-time effort to get some of these initiatives up and running, whether they're on the revenue side, the
product side, or the risk management framework side. So I wouldn't necessarily assume that the expenses that
we are incurring in 2024 all carry over to 2025.
But we are in an investment mode. I mean, I think we may be underinvested in certain years if you go back
historically. So I do think there's a little bit of catch up going on. But we are committed to make sure that we can
compete in the years going forward. And we do think a certain amount of investment is required there. And we
feel comfortable it's going to pay off.

Can you expand on that, Jim? Like, where did you underinvest, and where are you catching up now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, I would say, number one, some of it is just moving with the times, with the digitization and some of the
online capabilities. But I would also say that whether it'd be risk management framework or some of the product
innovation, I just don't think we necessarily always invested as much as we could have historically. And rather
than trailing on that front, we'd rather be leading. So, we think the easier thing to do would be to hunker down and
to starve the company and that's not something we want to do. So we feel like we're doing the right thing. And we
do feel like it's going to pay off with positive operating leverage as we move forward.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, this is Curt. I just would add that as I said earlier, we are focused on top line revenue growth. We believe
we have opportunities on both the fee income side and with the loan portfolio. But certainly, if we do not see
growth materializing, if the economy does not move in the right direction, if interest rates don't move in the right
direction allowing us to get some relief on deposit betas, et cetera, then we'll continue to look at expense
opportunities.
I'd also add that, part of this from a risk framework standpoint is continued investment in preparation for potentially
being over $100 billion, or if Basel III requirements step down to banks sub-$100 billion, kind of in our category at
$86 billion.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sorry about that. Good morning. Sorry about that. On the expenses, Jim, I think you've talked historically about
roughly $50 million for the $100 billion rule as you kind of know them today. Can you remind us how much you've
accrued is in the guide for 2024 related to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I would say we have a small portion of that in the guide for 2024. The vast majority of that $50 billion (sic) [$50
million] is probably more likely to be in future years as we get closer to $100 billion. But there are several million
dollars in there as we really try to address those things, Category IV, that we think have a longer runway to get
ready for. So those items that we think would take, say, two, three, four years to really be ready. We're getting
those things in motion now.
The majority of the Category IV requirements we either already have. Or if we don't have them, we think we could
complete them within one to two years. And so we're holding off on that. So, the majority of the $50 million is still
out there in the future. But we do have some of that in the run rate in 2023 and a little bit more in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Curt. I think the Street's got you roughly at a low teens return on tangible
common equity in this year and next. Can you maybe elaborate on how you think of the return potential of this
company? Obviously, you've got a much more stable margin over time. But you're also balancing some of the
investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I wouldn't maybe give a forecast exactly around returns or even multiples on the company. But I would say
that we believe that based on the comments we made earlier, certainly 2023 was a disruptive year and a reset for
the industry and 2024, I think, is some recalibration. I believe that interest rates are going to come down. And
when they do, I think it will have a positive impact on NII for us. And we believe, as we said earlier, that in the
latter half or second half of the year that we will start seeing NII return.
We think we've got great opportunities on the fee income side, and we showed that in 2023. And we think we've
got good growth opportunities in terms of the loan portfolio. And so our goal is to get to positive operating
leverage. And I believe that we can return at a level that's commensurate with the industry overall or better from a
longer term perspective. But 2024 will be somewhat of a continued inflection year.

Good morning, Brody.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Jim, I was hoping maybe you could help me nail down the cadence of the kind of BSBY swap amortization, the
accretion and the NII, how much of that – I think you said most of it's in 2025 and then in mid-2026. But how much
of it happens in 2024? And then, how much happens in 2025 and 2026?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Brody. Yeah. We don't have a 100% clear line of sight into that, because out of those $7
billion of BSBY hedges or hedges dedicated to BSBY loans, a little less than $3 billion of them are not re-
designated yet because we have not generated enough SOFR loans to re-designate those particular hedges. We
do expect to have that complete or at least largely complete by the end of the first quarter. And I think at that
point, we'll actually have a fair amount of certainty as to how it plays out.
But in general, the way it looks right now on the forward curve, and this is exclusive of what I offered in the
guidance because, again, there's a lot of uncertainty there, there was likely a very somewhat mild negative impact
in 2024 to the extent there is any kind of negative impact, you just accrete that back in later years. So, again, it's
not an economic loss. And then, we are very likely to get the vast majority of it back in 2025. Think of it as maybe
north of 80% of that loss accreted back in 2025 and then most of the remaining after that would come in 2026.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I guess, if I could just ask one fine point just on the first quarter with the re-
designation. Should we see something similar to what we saw this quarter, maybe not in terms of size, but just
directionally where there's a negative kind of non-operating impact to fee income and maybe a small positive
impact to NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
It really depends on the rate curve that's going to drive it, maybe to a lesser extent, the timing of when we re-
designate. Certainly, it's going to be a small fraction of what you saw in the fourth quarter. And again, whatever
you do see will simply accrete back in future quarters. So I know there won't be any kind of economic surprise
there, but from an accounting and recognition standpoint, there will be a little volatility the first quarter. And again,
we'll accrete that back in later quarters and likely mostly in 2025. But a little bit of volatility in Q1, but also a large
amount of not complete certainty after Q1 also and we can lay out that exact guidance and cadence.

Got it. So you don't have the dollar impact for the first quarter – an estimate for the dollar impact to NII for the first
quarter yet from this – from the BSBY stuff?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
We don't. We need for the dust to settle in terms of just getting the rest of these re-designated and where the rate
curves will drive that and again, we'll be made whole ultimately over the next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. If I could ask just another one on the NII guide for the year. I think you said it was a 60% beta that
you were running through the guidance. Do you happen to have what the non-interest-bearing deposit mix that's
underlying the guidance is for next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We continue to think that we were going to bottom out in the low 40s or very near 40%. And so we've been
pretty consistent on that over the last two to three quarters. Of course, a big driver of that isn't so much even just
non-interest-bearing deposits, but where interest bearing goes. And we do plan on having great success with
interest-bearing deposits as it relates to customers.
On the other hand, at some point, we probably will pay down some of these brokered deposits that we have
because that's really a form of wholesale funding that all banks make some degree of use of. So the overall level
of interest bearing will, of course, play some optical games with that percentage. But our base case is to be in the
low-40s towards nearing that 40% point.

Brody Preston Q

Okay. And then I did just want to ask on the liability sensitive disclosure. Could you maybe help me think about
the moving parts that make you liability sensitive? Just because, like if I just simply looked at you versus a lot of
your peers, at 40%, 41%, 42%, whatever it is right now, NIB, and still effectively 60%, I think, floating rate loans,
like both of those items, 60% might be closer to what I'd call regional bank kind of average for floating rate loans,
but the 42% NIB is still above average. So, like, I would holistically think about you as being mildly asset sensitive.
But what are the moving parts elsewhere on the balance sheet that push you towards liability sensitivity?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good point. And we do stick out in a very good way with our high level of non-interest-bearing
deposits in the mix. Where we also stand out and because we have that higher level of non-interest-bearing
deposits, we did put more swaps and securities on the book to manage to a more interest neutral position over
the last year. And that's exactly why we added those hedges. And that's what's offering us the protection in a
down rate environment.

Okay. So it's mostly the hedges then I guess combined with...

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's the – we always look at it holistically between both the hedges we put on in the form of both
swaps and securities. But that's the balancing X-factor to your equation there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then last one for me was just around the brokered deposits. I think the guidance assumes flat brokered
deposits moving forward. I guess, would you look to use the securities maturities kind of exclusively to pay down
borrowings? Or is there opportunity to kind of run off brokered deposits next year even though it's not
contemplated in the guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I would say the runoff of securities will be used for a combination of funding loan growth and reducing
wholesale funding. And I think of wholesale funding as both being some of the debt borrowings like FHLB, any
security maturities we might have or bond maturities we might have, and brokered deposit maturities. So there'll
be some mixture that goes on there in terms of the overall formula. But I suspect over time, and it's actually a goal
of ours to reduce brokered deposits over time. So at some point, you will see a reduction there and securities
maturities will be one of the inputs to that equation.
