Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our results for the third
quarter reflect solid execution against the challenging phase of this interest rate cycle, particularly as rates appear
close to be peaking. Third quarter deposit levels were generally in line with seasonal expectations, but funding
costs were significantly higher, putting pressure on net interest income.
We're focusing primarily on those areas of the business that are most under our control, namely trust fees and
expenses. In those two areas, we're pleased with our performance. Trust fee revenue was up both sequentially
and year-over-year. Expenses were well controlled, and we improved our capital position. Our Wealth
Management business grew trust fees on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We saw ongoing strength
in the higher wealth tiers and within our Global Family Office segment. Our momentum outside the US continues
to be brisk.
Families with large and complex trust structures continued to be an area where we excel. Activity with business
owners also remained robust, helping them optimize their complex personal affairs while they attend to growing
their businesses is a consistent theme. We're also seeing early success with various new marketing approaches
and referral sources. In particular, during the third quarter, we had healthy new business generation with clients
with assets over $50 million.
In asset management, we saw positive flows into our institutional money market platform for the third consecutive
quarter. Relative to benchmarks, our tax-advantaged equity product performance remained strong within the
quarter, cementing its one-, three- and five-year track record of outperformance. Importantly, two recent large
asset servicing wins contain asset management mandates for indexed fixed income and outsourced investment
solutions, reinforcing our combined strength as One Northern.
Within Asset Servicing, we had good momentum in core custody and fund administration, and our pipeline
remained solidly within historical levels. Our Front Office Solutions is resonating particularly well across regions
and different client types. One notable Front Office Solutions win in the third quarter was the $32 billion Abu Dhabi
Pension Fund. Our ability to provide a comprehensive view across public and private assets was cited as a key
differentiator.
Importantly, we were also selected to provide global custody, liquidity management, performance and risk
analytics, and portfolio optimization. We also had good success in the US asset owner space where we continued
to take share.
In closing, we enter the fourth quarter on solid footing. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample
capital and liquidity and our credit quality remains excellent. New business momentum is healthy and our pipeline
is robust. Expense growth has declined each quarter this year and I'm confident it will continue to build on this

discipline. We're well positioned to navigate the current uncertain environment, including the proposed regulatory
changes related to capital and long-term debt and generate value for our stakeholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on page 4. This morning, we reported third quarter net income
of $328 million, earnings per share of $1.49, and our return on average common equity was 11.6%.
Our assets under custody/administration and assets under management were down modestly on a sequential
basis, but up sharply on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable markets and currency movements more than offset
positive asset inflows relative to the prior period.
Year-over-year levels benefited from favorable markets, currency improvements and asset inflows. On a year-
over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90-basis-point favorable impact on revenue growth
largely within our asset services division and 100-basis-point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a sequential
basis, currency impacts were immaterial.
Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was down 2% on both a sequential quarter and year-over-year
basis. Expenses were up 1% sequentially and up 5% over the prior year. This reflects an expense to trust fee
ratio of 115%, down from 116% (sic) [122%] in the second quarter, but higher than the 112% (sic) [114%] we
posted in the third quarter of last year. Pre-tax income was up 1% sequentially, but down 20% over the prior year.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1
billion, a 1% sequential increase and a 3% increase compared to last year. All other noninterest income was up
6% sequentially, but down 3% over the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million, down
10% sequentially and down 11% from a year ago. Our provision for credit losses was $14 million in the third
quarter. Overall, our credit quality remains very strong with small net recoveries for the quarter, and there was a
modest increase in nonperforming loans.
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5. Assets under custody and administration for Asset Servicing
clients were $13.2 trillion at quarter-end, down 2% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Asset Servicing fees
totaled $626 million. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of fees in the business, were
$428 million. Sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business activity, offset by weaker
transaction volume. The year-over-year strength was due to solid new business activity and favorable market and
currency impacts that were partially offset by lower transaction volume.
Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $963 billion, down 3% sequentially, but up 10% year-
over-year. Similarly, because of the significant portion of our fees are billed on a lagged basis, the sequential
decline in AUM will impact our fourth quarter trust fees. Investment management fees within Asset Servicing were
$137 million.
Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6. Assets under management for our Wealth Management
clients was $370 billion. Trust administration and other servicing fees for Wealth Management clients were $486
million.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Our average balance sheet decreased 4% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to lower client deposits. Client
liquidity was essentially flat during third quarter. Average deposits were $102 billion, down $4 billion, or 4%
sequentially, in line with our expectations for this seasonably weaker quarter. The decline was seen largely in the
interest-bearing channel as clients continued to reallocate cash positions.
Noninterest-bearing deposits remained stable, down less than $1 billion sequentially, and the mix held steady at
17%. At quarter-end, operational deposits remained at approximately two-thirds of institutional deposits, and
institutional deposits comprised 75% to 80% of the total mix.
Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, the duration of the securities portfolio reduced slightly to 1.9 years.
The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were
flat sequentially. Our loan portfolio is well diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types.
Approximately 70% of the loan portfolio is floating and the overall duration is below one year.
Our liquidity remained strong. Cash held at the Fed and other central banks was down, reflecting the absorption
of the deposit decreases, but highly liquid assets comprised more than 55% of our deposits and nearly 50% of
total earning assets.
Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million for the quarter, down 10% sequentially and down 11% from
the prior year. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics. We saw some continued client migration into higher-
yielding cash alternatives, but the pace moderated as we expected. Deposit cost increases were slightly bigger
factor, with funding costs up 46 basis points over the second quarter.
Due to the competitive environment, we repriced a small number of meaningful products to ensure we're
protecting deposit volumes. We're not price leaders, but we're vigorously defending our deposits with an eye
toward playing the long game. We expect to benefit from this strategy when rates decline.
Client engagement also led to a combination of specific repricing on existing accounts and a shift to higher-paying
term deposits. There's no question that clients want to remain on our balance sheet. But sensing that the rate
cycle is close to peaking, they've begun to stretch for duration.
Our NII in the fourth quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior, which has been less predictable given
the speed and extent of this cycle's rate hikes. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are $100 billion.
Modest outflows are expected to continue due in part to client efforts to optimize returns and to some known
outflows related to M&A activity and other corporate needs. Pricing should remain under pressure with further
NIM compression possible.
We currently expect fourth quarter NII to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million. Factors that could swing
the outcome include the pace of further deposit outflows, the level of price pressure, the extent to which we
continue to see deposit mix shift, and the offsetting impact from the repricing of the securities portfolio. As we look
out to 2024, there are wide range of scenarios under which net interest income could trend. Deposit pricing
pressure, our securities maturity schedule, investment outlook, and other factors provide upside that's not
reflected in the current quarter.
Turning to page 8. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, down 4% sequentially,
but up 4% as compared to the prior year. Excluding unusual items in both periods, including those noted on the
slide, expenses in the third quarter were up 1% sequentially and up over 5% year-over-year.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
I'll hit on just a few highlights. Excluding unusual items, compensation expense was down 2% sequentially. This
reflected reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken year-to-date. The increase over the
last year reflects 2023 base pay adjustments. Excluding unusual items in all periods, non-compensation expense
was up 3% sequentially. Our expense to trust fee ratio improved 100 basis points sequentially to 115%, but
remains higher than our targeted range of 105% to 110%.
As a reminder, we began the year expecting to take at least 200 basis points off of our 2022 adjusted expense
growth rate of 9%. Our first quarter adjusted results were meaningfully better, up 5.8% year-over-year. Our
second quarter adjusted results were even better, up 5.3% year-over-year, and our third quarter results were in
the same range despite unfavorable currency impacts.
For the fourth quarter, we expect continued improvement. Compensation expense is expected to be up $5 million.
Benefits expense should be our normal fourth quarter lift of $3 million to $5 million. Outside services likely to be
up approximately $10 million. Equipment and software should be up approximately $10 million relative to adjusted
third quarter levels. And occupancy is expected to increase a few million dollars above adjusted third quarter
levels.
Other operating expense has many components, including market-driven categories that are not predictable. But
it has tended to increase in the fourth quarter. All in, this would put our full year adjusted expense growth rate at
approximately 5%, or roughly 400 basis points lower than 2022 levels.
Our financial model is based upon mid-single-digit trust fee growth from a combination of organic growth and
market appreciation. Against this backdrop, we hope to generate 100 basis points to 200 basis points in trust fee
operating leverage in normal macro environment.
Our capital levels and ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate at levels well above our
required regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was up slightly
from the prior quarter to 11.4%, as capital accretion more than offset the unfavorable impact from higher rates on
our securities portfolio. This reflects a 440-basis-point buffer above our regulatory requirements.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.9%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter-end, our AOCI was a
negative $1.4 billion, a slight improvement over second quarter levels. We returned $159 million to common
shareholders through cash dividends of $158 million and common stock repurchases of $1 million. We slowed our
buyback activity in order to reserve for the anticipated FDIC special assessment. We're well positioned to meet
the proposed regulatory requirements that Mike referenced without significant changes to our operating model.
And with that, Melissa, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we can go with our first question from Glenn Schorr with
Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Wow, it sounds like – it sounds like the price is right. I like it. Okay. So, I appreciate the range of outcomes for NII
next year that you can't control. So, we'll leave that aside for a sec. But you mentioned your expense to trust fee
ratio, your target, and what you can do in terms of operating leverage in a better environment or a normal
environment. I'm curious just what's the overall approach to expenses as you enter budget season next year
within that mindset of what your goals are. How do you approach it with that much uncertainty around things that
you can't control?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Well, as we enter – this is the time of year where we're thinking, trying to get a sense of where the launch
points will be. And I walked through a little bit of a financial model for you guys to think about, that if we're – over
time, we'll get lift from the equity markets and we should also have low- to mid-single-digit organic growth.
If we can get 100 to 200 basis points in fee operating leverage, that sets us up really well based on where our
pre-tax margin is for good EPS growth over time. And so, that's the goal that we – it's one of the metrics that we
look at really closely. And we're still in an inflationary environment where it's harder to get that operating leverage
if you're just looking at fees because the expenses are elevated and you don't get the benefit from higher rates on
the trust fee line.
But you can tell that we've spent an incredible amount of effort this year working the year-over-year expense
growth rates down. And you go back to 2022 and printing a 9% growth coming into this year, we knew we had to
do better than that, and we've been grinding that down each quarter, quarter after quarter. We first tackled it with
working hard on labor, and you can see that's the biggest cost that we have, so we have to get that right. Head
count's down.
And then another key element is technology. That shows up in equipment, software and outside services. That's
still elevated above the rest of the company in terms of growth rate. But we've had a lot of accomplishments there,
too, and expecting to have that growth rate be lower next year than it has historically. And so, we think we can
have another year next year that's similar to what we did in this year, which is to work that – continue to work that
year-over-year growth rate down.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. You have tons of capital, and you've generated plenty also. But I'm
curious, some of the big banks have articulated what they thought as is that the RWA impact or all-in impact might
be. I'm curious, at your first glance, what type of impacts are we talking? I know that you mentioned it doesn't
disrupt your model, and I agree. I'm just curious if you can help us box it in in terms of [ph] all three (00:21:03)
impact if as is. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Yeah. I'm going to give you a wide range, like, 5% to 15% in RWA. And that's going to be impacted by a few
different things. But one of the benefits that we have is the diversification of the business model. And so, we've
got – obviously, the custody business comes with a lot of operational risks. That's really the most significant
driver. But we'll actually get some benefit from an RWA perspective in some of the loan treatments, just given the
nature of our underlying loans. And then there are some other dynamics that we have that should help on RWA
as well on a relative basis. But it's worth thinking about at this point, it could be anywhere from 5% to 15%. But as
we mentioned earlier, feel really comfortable and we see where our CET1 levels are and see where our liquidity
is. And so, we'll keep an eye on where our peers are. We'll keep an eye on what the business is doing, but we've
got flexibility and other ways to manage that dynamic as well.

Operator: We can take our next question from Michael Brown with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess I wanted to start on the custody and fund admin fees. They were
essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I guess a little bit softer than we expected. What were some of the key
drivers that played out this quarter? And as you noted, the lower market levels present a bit of a headwind here
for the fourth quarter. But you did talk about some positive dynamics on the new business front. So, what are the
puts and takes that we should think about here for the fourth quarter and then heading into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, first of all, the – if you just look at the custody and fund admin line and split it, we'd talked about the fact
that currency on a sequential basis was effectively a push year-over-year. It helped more than that, roughly in the
neighborhood of 1.5% to 2%. But if we just go back and look sequentially at how the quarter looked, the net new
8

(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
business in custody and fund admin fees was a positive. It was low-single digits, very low single digits but
positive. And then, transaction volumes continue to be light.
And we're starting to talk about that dynamic as something that might be more long-term, just as our clients move
more toward more indexing as opposed to active management. There's less trading activity. There's less
reporting. There's less transitions. And so, we did – we're continuing to see a lower level of transaction-related
activity. But the overall business is strong. Again, net positive from an overall net new business perspective and
the pipeline, as Mike mentioned, looks strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, if we just change gears to the deposit side. It sounds like the pressure there still remains. Can
you just maybe unpack some of those underlying dynamics by client type and maybe just touch on where the
pressure is perhaps the greatest and maybe where there's a bit less of a challenge. And are you seeing some
elements of the deposit base that are seeing stabilization here or is it really kind of across the board?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Definitely feel it stabilized in a lot of ways. It's hard to predict where it's going to go because, obviously, it's been a
volatile cycle and clients are clearly trying to figure out what to do from here. There's a lot of clients that are
terming out their deposits. We saw in the wealth side, just to get at your question of how it's separated by
channel, the wealth side, we saw a significant increase in term deposits. So, clients are saying this is an
opportunity to move out of checking and into CDs. And a part of that is the nature of our clients where they have
large amounts of deposits. And so, they can take a component of their deposits and think about that more
strategically and less about the need to maintain that liquidity just for day-to-day payments.
But interestingly on the wealth side, deposits were actually up if you look 6/30 to 9/30, they're up somewhat. And
so, it gives us an indication that the pricing actions we took worked really well. Clients are – they continue to see
the strength of the balance sheet. They like to deposit on Northern Trust balance sheet. So that increase was
meaningful.
In the institutional side, that's what drove the period-to-period and most of the average decline, and that comes to
a lot of clients is moving to different types of either longer-duration or higher-yielding liquidity types. Overall,
liquidity across the company was flat across the channels cumulatively. And so, clients clearly are just saying
Northern is the right place to be. They're moving from one overall liquidity mechanism to another. And as we look
out, I think it's interesting to see that the balances thus far in the quarter have held in just over $100 billion. And
frankly, that's higher and it's still early in the quarter, but it's higher than what we would have anticipated at this
point.
And the $430 million to $440 million, just to give some context there, that assumes that net interest margin would
be relatively flat, up a couple to a few basis points. But deposits would have to come down and average in the
$93 billion to $95 billion for us to get down to that $430 million to $440 million. And so at this point, thus far, again,
it's very – we're 2 weeks in to a 13-week quarter, the deposit levels are holding in higher than that.

Operator: And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Jason. Good morning. Hey, Mike, as well. So just, like, another one around deposits. You guys seemed to
have been a bit surprised, I guess, by this latest move in terms of kind of the catch-up that you played there, you
articulated at the conference in September and obviously today. Do you feel like you caught up to where
institutional pricing is or do you still think there's might be incremental migration or kind of the need to increase
price more?
And then, again, on the institutional side of things, is there a particular client base or channel internationally that is
driving this pickup or is that fairly broad based? Because your competitor said that is fairly limited, right? I mean,
we know there's three or four and at the end of the day, that's who you compete with on the custody side. So, I'm
just kind of curious where we are in that process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It seems like we caught up. And we made – if we get to why we – we thought we were going to be down about
5% in NII. We ended up down 10%. We saw that mid-quarter and hit right on the number. So what happened in,
call it, the August timeframe, we clearly saw that, in general, the market was taking deposit pricing up. And we
reacted to that. Again, we're not price makers, we're price takers. And so, we reacted to that, and it seems to very
much have leveled out the deposit activity. And that's why you see things very kind of flattish and then also ended
this quarter stabilizing at levels we thought would be even higher.
And so, I think the big takeaway is it seems like the pricing is where it needs to be for clients to level things out.
And the pricing actions that we took were in pretty small number but of big accounts. And you asked about kind of
geography. The bigger actions we took were in the US custody book on the institutional side of the business; and
then in wealth, it was in MMDA. And so, we took a targeted approach to increase those pricings, and early
reactions look like we got it, we hit the mark well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Thanks. Shifting gears a little bit, pretty constructive comments from you guys on the new
business. We heard that for the last couple of quarters. As you know, converting that to fees is always a little hard
and it's a bit opaque. So, any way you can frame maybe the fee backlog. And as we sort of work that through into
revenues over the next, call it, 12 months, do you feel like you have enough scale in the business to onboard,
especially some of these larger mandates without a material pickup in expenses? So, in other words, to Glenn's
10

point, it sounds like you guys are aiming for, I don't know, 3% to 4% expense growth in 2024. Is that doable with
potentially more net new business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It is. And we didn't give a number on the expense growth, just that we want to do better than what we did this
year. And so, with that backdrop, the growth in the Asset Servicing business in particular has come with
expenses. It's a less scalable business relative to wealth, which is obviously highly, highly scalable. That said,
we're focused, as you can tell from what we've done this year, not just on top line growth, but on managing the
type of business that comes in.
And so, that's why head count was such an incredible focus for us this year. The compensation line, an incredible
focus. And so, as we look at what business to bring on board, there's going to be a very strong scrutiny on looking
at what expenses come along with it. The business is committed to do that. They're leading that effort saying that
they're going to be very diligent about identifying what business to bring on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And, Alex, I would just add to what Jason is saying there, that's why we're driving so hard on productivity as
well is because we have to have the capacity to invest in the foundation of the business and what we're building
out, the investments we need to make. But then also, to your point, if you're going to bring on new business that
has resources, you have to be able to offset a portion of that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That all makes sense. And sorry, I didn't mean to put words in your mouth on the 3% to 4% as it

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Yeah. Good morning, Jason. How are you doing? Would love to unpack a little bit, because I –
you walked through some of the – it sounds like you walked through some of the underlying assumptions behind
the $430 million to $440 million expectation for 4Q. It sounded like you were saying that it predicated a deposit
base of $93 billion to $95 billion and NIM flat. Did I interpret that correctly? And does that suggest that you're sort
of girding for further deposit declines even though they've been stable quarter-to-date?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Just to tweak the words, I mentioned that implies NIM would be up a few basis points, but the deposit levels you
mentioned are accurate. And so, coming – last quarter, we came into it thinking we're going to be down 5%. The
market ended up being more competitive. And again, we've got to react to what the market's doing, we don't set it.
And so, coming into this quarter, we did prepare for further decline in deposits. And that could easily still happen.
So not walking that back, which is saying that early stages of the quarter are indicating the deposit levels are
higher than that. And we've also got – even as we look out to next year, we don't think about this $430 million to
$440 million as the run rate of NII. There's reasons for us to believe that NII is going to go up from there. And just
that you look at the runoff in the securities portfolio and we're still trading securities that are yielding 2% and
reinvesting it at 5%. And securities yielding in the 2s and reinvesting it above that, and so without taking more risk
or duration. And so, there are things that we can continue to do.
We've also had the balance sheet positioned very defensively. And we saw the decline in deposits that was
happening and frankly, the stress in the banking industry in the spring and in the summer. And we positioned very
defensively. We wanted to – we have the ability to do that based on the strength of the balance sheet. We can
stay short. We cannot stretch for NII. But as we feel more confident about the stability of deposits, the stability of
the industry, we can use non-HQLA capacity. And so, there's multiple levers we have to work on NII for it.
So, although we're trying to give you as much color as we can about fourth quarter, the interpretation shouldn't be
that that's necessarily something that you should annualize thinking about 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All that's fair. I guess the 2024 will depend on the competition for deposits. So, we'll see how that goes. So,
one follow-up here. You guys made reference, and I apologize if you said it in the prepared remarks, there's a
couple overlapping calls here this morning, but you laid out a Visa gain in the press release, but I didn't hear it
quantified in the commentary. Is it possible to quantify that impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's up $10 million to $15 million relative to second quarter. Second quarter was a slight loss. This was a
slight gain. And that – just a little bit of color, that relates to a derivative that we have associated with part of our
Visa position. And as our view of the length of that swap extends or reduces, that has an impact to the mark-to-
market.

And as there was news that was proposed by – or there's news that was put out this quarter of Visa saying that
they have a shareholder proposal to release half the shares, it reduces the amount of time in that swap and so,
therefore, it changed the mark from what it otherwise would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q

Operator: And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, just when thinking through the puts and takes to NII, you mentioned taking securities,
yielding 2% and reinvesting at 5%. Could you just update us on how much AFS and HTM roll-off you're expecting
per quarter going forward. And as those securities mature, are you mostly reinvesting that onto cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I want to make sure I got the question fully. Can you repeat it for me, you just came through a little soft. I want to
make sure I got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So, as you're reinvesting securities from 2% into 5%, could you let us know just how much AFS and HTM
roll-off you're expecting per quarter, and are you reinvesting that onto cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. A lot of the reinvestment recently has been in cash. And [ph] I began (00:38:13) as I mentioned just a few
minutes ago, that's not necessarily where we'll be reinvesting it before. And as we look at the schedule, it
probably averages – the runoff averages about 2%, particularly – and let's just take the US dollar-denominated
amounts. And then overall, there's about close to a little over $1 billion a quarter across all the currencies that's
maturing, that's reinvesting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q

Operator: And moving on to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks.

Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just one clarification on the
other investment in – or the other income that was the $68 million this quarter versus $55 million in the second
quarter. Should we take that $55 million and think of that as a more normalized run rate, given the noise on the
Visa swap gain?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I think that Visa is going to – at some point in time, I think the noise in that line item will just go away. And
there's – Visa did announce that – they did make this announcement. And so that should have an impact on the
swap at some point. And so, I think it shouldn't be – again, it has tended to be a negative. That negative will go
away. And so, the prior run rates are probably too low and the current run rate might be too high is the best way
to think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Fair enough on that. And then just on the NII guide, just to clarify also the $430 million to $440
million, is that FTE? And then – well, let me just ask that first. That's FTE, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Great. And then just as we move into 2024, some of the elements, obviously a lot of wide ranges of
what can potentially happen. But on the competition front, sounded like that was fairly episodic. This third quarter,
it got resolved and just sort of, I guess, your view on whether you think that might reemerge. Of course, it's always
tough to predict, but just in terms of the fact that you're able to defend it with higher rates but keep those deposits,
would that seemingly be a disincentive for other providers to try to grab those deposits and not actually get them?
And then, what would you think of – maybe it's tough to answer, too, but what level of deposits is at risk of that
competition within the custody and the wealth business?

In the institutional business, let's start there, that a lot of those deposits are there for clients to be processing
payments. And they not only have the end-of-day deposit needs, but intraday needs as they have – they can have
intraday overdrafts. And so, they've got to think about their liquidity, not just end of the day but intraday. And we
process a tremendous amount of payments across the system. And so, that's why we always are talking about
not just the traditional operational component, but the amount of dollars and velocity that we have in the Asset
Servicing business, which is very high.
The amounts that are more sensitive to rates tend to be very large clients that are making a decision on where to
park large amounts of dollars. And those tend to be negotiated. And that's the – that's kind of the top end, but
that's also where there's lighter spread.
In the wealth side of the business, clients are making decisions more from a product perspective, and they're
moving between term, treasuries, money market funds, and traditional checking accounts. And we've seen
increases in all non-checking account areas over this cycle. And we've seen CDs go from less than $1 billion to
close to $4 billion. And that obviously has a really big impact when you think that that's coming from a traditional
checking account into a market rate CD, there's 100 basis points of difference.
And so if – it gives you a little bit of a sense of – on the wealth side if – we've talked about 75% of the deposits
overall that we have are in institutional and 25% in wealth. And then you see the type of movement that can
happen if we're talking about $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion of movement of that $20 billion to $30 billion base, it's
pretty meaningful. But it's – the good news is it has stayed with us and we've done a good job of holding on to the
deposits. Again, it's been – deposits up this past quarter and overall client liquidity for the business flat from one
quarter to another.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Yeah. I'm a little confused on the NII guidance. So, you're looking to be down 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter to
$430 million to $440 million, but you said don't take that as a run rate. And so, what kind of run rate do you think
you'll have? Because I guess you're guiding down NII 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So, how much of
that do you think you'd get back as you take those 2% securities, reinvestment 5% and take all your other
actions? And do you think the fourth quarter will be the low point or the NII inflection comes later? Or just a little
bit more color on that if you could.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, sure. No, fourth quarter could be – it could definitely be a low point and particularly thinking about some of
the things that we mentioned. But just taking the securities run-off alone, the math gets to – you get to over, call it,
a $10 million, $12 million, $13 million lift per quarter coming from just the securities maturing and reinvesting
again in similar duration, similar credit profile, and that's without us taking these other actions.
And just as our clients are thinking about where are we in the yield – in the overall rate cycle, we think about that
as well. And we've – again, we positioned – we've had the balance sheet positioned in a pretty defensive manner
and this provides us an opportunity to start thinking about what do we do differently. But just the maturity schedule
alone has kind of a, call it, a $50 million annualized lift to it. And that's just one of the levers that we have that we'll
be working from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
In light of just more headwinds, though, than you had expected, I know you said no more expense plans but – and
you have kind of [indiscernible] (00:45:59) cost curve, which is the expression, I guess, of the year, any thoughts
of tightening up expenses even more than you've already done?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. The Productivity Office we launched just in this year from kind of a standing start and we're going to get
over $100 million within this – $100 million of savings in this year. Most of those are on a recurring basis. And so,
you see a lot of that reflected in the actions we took from a compensation perspective. But negotiations with
consulting firms, how we're looking at demand for technology consumption, how we're managing real estate.
And so, we've pulled a lot of levers there and couldn't have a higher sense of urgency on what we're thinking
about from a productivity perspective. But we should be getting above 2% a year in help from productivity. And
we're not going to stop uncovering opportunities and having difficult conversations about what we can stop doing
or how we can be thinking about things differently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Mike, definitely continued focus on productivity as Jason is saying. So, just want to emphasize that point. There
are still plenty of opportunities to functionalize, automate, centralize, a number of different, I'll call it, more
fundamental structural things that we're doing already, but just have longer time frames to implement them in
order to get those savings longer-term, and a lot around technology that enables that. So, it absolutely has been a
focus but will continue to be a focus, particularly as the environment is so uncertain and not necessarily knowing
what the direction of whether it's rates or markets are going to be.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

Hey, Gerard.

Very well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys – can we take a step back. We're obviously all in the weeds in the quarter-to-quarter stuff for all of
the banks understandably so. But when you step back, if we're now, after, when was it since the financial crisis,
let's call it, 14 years of a incredibly low interest rate environment with a little blip up in 2018, of course, but if we're
now in a new environment for the next three to five years where the short end of the curve stays above 3% or 4%,
maybe even 5% for nobody knows, for sure, how does that maybe alter the way you guys have been running the
business for the last 10 years in a 0% rate environment to one now that is going to be 300 basis points to 400
basis points higher at the front end of the curve? Or does it alter the way you run the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Gerard, it's Mike. Appreciate the question. And the answer is yes, it does alter the way that we have to look at the
business. And just starting with some of your comments there just around low interest rate environment, higher
interest rate environment, what aspects to that are cyclical versus maybe permanent changes. Jason mentioned
some of the shifts in the way institutional investors invest and the implications on transaction volumes that may
come with that.
And as a result, beyond looking at the productivity of the business, which I think we've emphasized here, we also
have to look at the pricing side of the business to ensure that we are being appropriately compensated for all the
high value added services that we're providing, I'll say, to all our clients, because it really isn't specific to just
institutional clients or wealth clients.
But if there was an expectation that you were managing a certain level of deposits as a part of an overall
relationship, that was a part of the value you were receiving for all the services you're providing. If that's going to
be different for some time period, then you have to be compensated in different ways.
Now, you know our model well enough to know it's not a consumer product or something where you change the
pricing daily or even monthly. So, it's something that you have to work through the longer-term way that your
17

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
services are priced and the way relationships work. I mean, we're always looking to retain relationships, but also
very focused on expanding them.
And the more we can do with the clients, the better the overall economics. So my point, which I think you're on to
it is we do and have been looking at this holistically, both on the revenue side and on the expense side so that we
can continue to look at meeting the financial targets that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you, Mike. And then as a follow-up, Jason, you were talking about – obviously you're
approaching your budgeting season and I'm not asking you to obviously tell us what's going on yet, but can you
frame out for us, a year ago, this time, when you were doing the budgeting for 2023, and as you pointed out, you
guys have made progress in reducing expense rate of growth, but can you frame out for us the outside factors
that you were dealing with last year at this time, whether it is wage inflation or just inflation in general versus
today. Is it a little easier today or no, just as tough, the outside factors haven't really changed and it's going to be
a tough environment to put together a budget?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Last year, we were in a heavy, heavy inflationary environment that was hitting us in not just our labor costs, but
also, we were defending from others trying to take our talent a lot was one of the talking points that we had at the
time. That had implications and we were just spending time on that as well. And then we were seeing inflation
come and technology costs in a lot of different ways.
So, every budget year is really, really difficult. I have to say that the macro headwinds last year, I feel, were
heavier than they are this year.
