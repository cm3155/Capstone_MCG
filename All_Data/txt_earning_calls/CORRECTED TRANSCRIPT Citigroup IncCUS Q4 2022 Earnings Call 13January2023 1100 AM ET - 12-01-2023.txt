Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer,
Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi
Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which
time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is
being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Ms. Landis, you may begin.

Jennifer Landis
Head-Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's
presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking
statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in
circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including
those described in our SEC filings.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.

Jane Nind Fraser
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Jen, and Happy New Year to everyone joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start
2023. Today, I'll share our perspective on the macro environment, before recapping our performance in the fourth
quarter, and then I shall take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the
coming year.
The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we
enter 2023, the environment is a tad better than we all expected, for the time being at least, despite the
aggressive tightening by central banks.
In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies, and inflation is beginning to ease off its
peak. That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the eurozone this year given some of the
structural challenges it is grappling with.
In Asia, while the public health impacts in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID-
Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally.
And here at home, the labor market remains strong, and holiday spending was better than expected in part
because consumers have been dipping into their savings. The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation,
however, and therefore we continue to see the US entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year.
Now, turning to how we performed, for the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of
$1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3%, ex-divestitures, was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor
Day, as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an RoTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
This quarter our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year, and we're quite pleased with
some and less happy with the performance of others.
Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our Markets businesses are navigating the environment
very well, and we're seeing good momentum in US Personal Banking. On the flipside, Investment Banking felt the
pain of a drastically smaller wallet in 2022, and the environment for Wealth remained a challenging one.
Unpacking that a bit, Services delivered another excellent quarter, and we have gained significant share in both
Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services. TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our
global network, had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we executed on the strategy we laid out at the Investor
Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations.
Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new
assets under administration and custody.
Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, with revenues up 18% from 2021. We had the number-one
FICC franchise on the Street during the first three quarters of the year, and fixed income was up 31% in the final
quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity again did not play to our strengths in derivatives. With the
wallet down significantly, our Investment Banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline
looks more promising and client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will
turn in 2023.
Wealth Management's performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter with the macro
environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we
have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across
the spectrum and net new investment flows. Similarly, we continue to build our client advisor base, albeit at a
slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover.
In US Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter
as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly, whilst in Retail Banking, we clearly have
some more work to do.
As you know, we've been actively managing our balance sheet and risk. Our cost of credit increased in line with
our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in
anticipation of a mild recession. And in the US, net credit losses in cards continued to normalize as we had
expected, still well below pre-COVID levels.
Corporate credit remained healthy and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the
quality of our Corporate Loan portfolio.
In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And
finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65 and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders
through our common dividends.
Now, let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in
place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the
ground. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've already made.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
We simplified the bank, closing the sales of our consumer businesses in five markets, including three in the fourth
quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our
franchise in Russia. We continued to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize
our bank. We're streamlining our processes and making them more automated, whilst improving the quality and
accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank.
We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals, and strengthened our culture by increasing
accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I'm pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for
the year.
We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing, and
announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the US.
Finally, I'm very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which defined 2022 and
supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout.
Before I hand over to Mark, let's turn to the next few years and in particular the path to achieving our medium-
term return targets, that we laid out on page 5.
At Investor Day, we talked about the path coming in three phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined
execution and investments. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term
shareholder value. We're focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the
expectation that our businesses will close out 2023 competitively stronger.
Services enters 2023 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovations and market-leading
product capabilities. Markets to continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further
advancing on the back of investments and the businesses' focus on capital productivity.
Banking and Wealth are well-positioned for when this cycle turns, thanks to the investments we've made in top
talent and technology, as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the
right time to make a change in Wealth, and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business. I
asked Jim O'Donnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep
expertise in relationship, and when combined with Sunil Garg's additional role as North America Head, is
designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market.
US Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery in borrowing, taking full advantage of our market-
leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our
international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course,
focus on our clients' deepening relationships and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy.
We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation
and controls. However, we will pay some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment.
Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets.
We'll do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation, and
further simplification, and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly. We fully recognize this suppresses our

returns in the near term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary
to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value.
We are carrying not just our momentum but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are
very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally
designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments. We are running the bank
differently with a relentless focus on execution, and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with
you along the way.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.

Mark A. L. Mason
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the
fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise.
I'll also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023.
On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter we reported net income of
approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16, and an RoTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in
these results, are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on
divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10, with an RoTCE of approximately 5.5%.
In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across
Services, Markets, and US Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Wealth, and
the revenue reduction from the closed exits.
Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related
costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by
investments in our transformation, business-led investments, and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset
by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exits.
Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit
losses, particularly in Retail Services, and an ACL build of $645 million largely related to growth in card and some
deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income
and an RoTCE [audio gap] (00:15:18)
Now turning to the full year revenue walk on slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up
3% excluding the impact of divestitures, in line with our guidance of low-single digit growth.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 32% driven by continued benefits from rates as well as business
actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients, and winning new clients across all
segments. Client wins have accelerated due to the investments that we've been making in market-leading product
capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 US dollar clearing capability in the industry, the seven-day cash
sweep product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payments, which is live in 33 markets reaching over
60 countries.
So while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the
remaining half.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59% driven by higher interest rates
across currencies, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market
valuations. For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration
from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals.
In Markets, we grew revenues 7% mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continued to serve our
corporate and investor clients, while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets
primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives.
On the flip side, Banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 39% driven by
Investment Banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.
In Cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continued to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022,
along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels.
And in Wealth, revenues were down 2% largely driven by market valuations and China lockdowns. Excluding
Asia, revenues were up 3%.
Corporate/Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed
us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in Legacy Franchises, excluding
divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed five of the exit markets and
continued to wind down Russia and Korea consumer. Going forward, we would expect Legacy Franchises to
continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit markets.
On slide 8, we show an expense loss for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding
divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8%, in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%,
with about two-thirds of the increase related to risk, control, data, and finance programs. And approximately 25%
of the investments in those programs are related to technology.
About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding
scalability to our TTS and Securities Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses, and
developing new product capabilities. We also continued to invest in front-office talent, albeit at a more measured
pace, given the environment. And volume-related expenses were up 1% largely driven by Markets and Cards.
The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control
investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially
offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction
from the exit market. Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year.
On slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which
we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions including
those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn't anticipate at Investor Day impacted some KPIs positively
and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy.
In TTS, we continued to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and
existing clients as we roll out new product offerings and invest in the client experience which is a key part of our
strategy.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, and these again include marquee transactions where
we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. For the third quarter year to date, we estimate that we
gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our number one position with large institutional clients. In
addition, we've onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to
address the evolving global landscape.
And in Securities Services, we on boarded new client assets which offset some of the decline in market
valuations, and we estimate that we've gained about 50 basis points of share in Securities Services through the
third quarter of this year, including in our home market.
In Markets, we've strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress
towards our revenue to RWA part. In Cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both Branded Cards and
Retail Services. Cards spend volumes were up 14%. End of period loans up 13%, and most importantly, interest-
earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like Investment Banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our
market position. And in Wealth, while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets, given the impact of
market valuations, this didn't translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point.
So, in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets, despite the significant changes in
the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable
to many environments, and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium-term.
Now, turning back to the fourth quarter, on slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans. In the
fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven
by Services, Cards, and Markets. Average loans were down as growth in Cards was more than offset by declines
in ICG and Legacy Franchises. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits
were down by approximately 1% largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises, and the impact of foreign
exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average
deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM, and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points.
On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment
with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loan ratio is approximately 2.6%, and within that, PBWM
and US Cards is 3.8% and 7.6%, respectively, both just above day one CECL levels and we feel very good about
the high-quality nature of our portfolio.
In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in US Cards, and of that, Branded Cards makes up 66% and Retail
Services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers, and NCL
rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels.
In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure,
approximately 90% is investment grade for exposure to multi-national clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate
non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That
said, we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of scenarios. So, while the macro
and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures, and
reserve levels.

On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong
balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about a quarter or just under $600 billion consist of HQLA, and
we maintain [audio gap] (00:25:21). And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago.
On slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 wall to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets
over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income
to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends which
drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove
an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of
exits, RWA optimization, and market moves towards the end of the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter.
As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer. That
will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing, while continuing to
have ample capacity to serve our clients. And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and
continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter.
On slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by
3% this quarter, with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII, Securities Services revenues up 22%, Markets
revenue up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity, and Investment Banking
revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume.
Expenses increased 6% driven by transformation, business-led investments specifically in Services, and volume-
related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $56 million, driven
by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of
approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses.
ICG delivered a 7.9% RoTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact
of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%.
Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%
and, sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICG grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered
approximately $10.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE of 11.1%.
Now, turning to slide 15, we show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth management business.
Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue
driven by lower investment product revenue in Wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses
were up 7% driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives.
Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in
macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in Retail Services.
Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work
in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build
this quarter and higher expenses. For the full year, PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in
revenue.
On slide 16, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues decreased 6% primarily driven by the closing of
five exit markets as well as the impact of the wind-down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence
of divestiture-related impacts last year related to Korea.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
On slide 17, we show results for Corporate Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by
higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses.
On slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1.
We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term
shareholder value.
With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion. Excluding any potential
2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion. Also excluding 2023 divestiture-related
impacts, net credit losses in Cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13%
CET1 target and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close
additional exits and announce others.
On slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023,
excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII
and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions.
And for Securities Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuations and onboarding of
additional client assets. We also assume somewhat of a normalization in Wealth as lockdowns in China end, and
market valuations start to rebound. And we expect Investment Banking to begin to rebound as the
macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity. As for Markets, we expect it to be relatively
flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022.
Now, turning to the NII guidance for 2023, we expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow
volume particularly in Cards and we continue to get the benefit of US and non-US rate hikes in our Services
businesses. As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes a reduction of revenue from the exits in Legacy
Franchises that we closed in 2022 and we expect to close this year in 2023.
Turning to slide 21, in 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that
we've made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first,
transformation as we continue to invest in data, risk and controls, and technology to enhance our infrastructure
and ultimately make our company more efficient; second, business-led investments as we execute against our
strategy; third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations; and, fourth, elevated levels of
inflation, mainly impacting compensation expense partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits
from the exits. And we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses
increasing by 5%.
While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses, these are investments that we have to make, and I
am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future.
And finally, let's talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium-term was
three to five years. That timeframe represented 2024 to 2026. So, while a lot has changed in the macro
environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target in
the medium-term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction, and capital levels
largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12%
RoTCE target.

So, let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher
and at a faster pace across the globe which accelerated NII growth, and that coupled with the execution of our
strategy has allowed certain business to accelerate. At the same time, other businesses such as Wealth and
Investment Banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue
CAGR in the medium-term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit.
From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium-
term, and we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The three main drivers of the
necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exits, which will be included in Legacy Franchises; the
benefits from our investments in transformation and control; and the simplification of the organizational structure.
First, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in Legacy Franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of
the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement
that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind-down
which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we
expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes to technology-enabled
ones.
And finally, we will remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further
opportunities for expense reductions in the future. From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to
continue to normalize, and any future ACL builds or releases will be a function of macro assumptions and
volumes.
So, to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with
Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Thanks so much. And definitely appreciate all these outlook slides. They're very helpful. And my – so my question
on the outlook is if you take a look at the current medium-size return on tangibles and getting to your target, I
heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track. Is it the expense spend at the end of 2024 that
is the material step-up from here to there, if you will? And/or is credit, like, a really big determinant in the process?
I'm trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today's return on tangible to the target. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Good morning, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So, we did give you some guidance here. We gave it
to you both on the top line and the middle line for 2023, and then importantly, when we talk about the medium-
term, it's both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it's also bringing the
expenses down from this 2023 forecast.
And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what's going to bring these expenses down, the
combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that, with the benefits that
we start to generate from the transformation spend, and then org simplification that this type of strategic
restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for. And so, it's the combination of
revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of, as we've been
talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent
with what we've seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we've been managing through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
I appreciate that. Thank you. Just one quick follow-up and totally – it's not my norm, but I normally try to respect
this type of process, but, Mark, we consider you a super important part of this transformation. There's been news
out there about you talking to one of my other companies, but would you be able to make any comments? You
mentioned your commitment staying on. Sorry to put you on the spot, but I think a lot of people care.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I appreciate that, Glenn, and Citi is an important firm. I'm the CFO of this firm, and this strategy is something that
I'm focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that create shareholder value for our
investors, and so we're committed to getting that done.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey, Mark. I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023. You've got about the midpoint, it kind of implies
about a 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%. So, for this
year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5% and the markets you're assuming kind of
flat. So, what's enabling you to get to the 4%? Where are the drivers that are above 4%? Is it some of those fee
businesses? And just a little more color there will be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So, let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I've given on the page
is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses, and that really comes from both the
annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year, but also expected continue increases
particularly outside of the US. And given the makeup of our franchise, we will – that will contribute to the NII
growth.
And then, keep in mind that we're growing over the Legacy Franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023.
So, underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it will be a
slower pace than what we saw in 2022.
From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation, and
that would play out both in banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while it's down
50% to 60%, and as well as some normalization in Wealth, and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then – sorry, if this is clear already, but just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of
2024, is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024 expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of
peak out, plateau towards the back half of 2024? Is that how we should envision it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I'm not going to kind of get into 2024 guidance. We'll kind of get through 2023, and I'm confident about our ability
to get to that roughly $54 billion number that I put out for 2023. I'm equally confident that we will bend this curve
and we'll bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the RoTCE target, but I'm not going
to kind of get into, John, the specifics of 2024, except to say that by the end of 2024 we will see that curve
bending.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is, again, thank you for all the clarification on the slides. Great job, Jen and Tom, and Mark,
obviously. But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think your investors are appreciative that you
are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation. As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-
term RoTCE, how should we think about what's bending the curve really means? And I'm not looking for guidance
necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what's a better way of measuring? Should we – is it an
efficiency ratio? I think you mentioned something like – is it the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5%
revenue CAGR that you think you'll be able to hit by 2025? Should we think of it that way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So at Investor Day, we did talk about it and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about
getting to an efficiency ratio that's less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of
the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down.
I think the other thing I'd mention just – you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important
aspects to that. The exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is, the portion
that's tied to stranded costs. Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance
of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking
the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operation.
I think the third piece is that technology, right? And so, right now, a lot of what we're doing is manual, and as we
continue to invest in technology – and technology's up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be
up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and
that will bring down the operational costs for running the firm. And so, those are a couple of examples, I hope, of
the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time
and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And I would say you can get some confidence [indiscernible] (00:46:18) around the path on many of these by the
urgency with which we're executing the divestitures, for example, getting those transactions closed. And we've
also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be actually – will be
closing and the speed of the wind-downs that we're executing. So, that will help. As Mark said, it's three big
structural drivers of what will bend that curve.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. And, Mark, I'm sorry for misspeaking. I was looking at the wrong borrowing efficiency. I have, like, 15
slides open on my computer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
That's okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
The second question – and maybe this is to you, Jane. I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of
urgency with regards to the divestitures. I think the elephant in the room continues to be, I think, investors sort of
expected an announcement on Banamex right now, and I'm wondering if you're still considering just selling
Banamex, or are you thinking about different options on the table such as an IPO?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
So, we're in active dialog at the moment, so I'm obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do
continue to pursue a dual path as you'd expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a
position to give you clarity, we will do so.
I think we've been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the two franchises, our institutional
franchise from the consumer franchise that we're selling, because we see the institutional franchise as a very
important part of the global network. As you can imagine in today's environment, Mexico is key for many of our
corporate clients around the world for their supply chains, and we play a very important role there. That is a lot of
work in that separation. I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making in that underlying work, but we
are pursuing the dual tracks, and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm still trying to get over this revenue and expense guidance. So, you're implying you'll have at a minimum flat
operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023? Am I reading that correctly? So, on the one hand,
you're not bending the cost curve until late 2024. On the other hand, you're guiding for positive operating leverage
in 2023. Am I reading that correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, Mike, when you do the math, I don't think it'll get to positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you
see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less
than the growth that $54 billion number would – roughly $54 billion number would suggest. But we are on the right
track, and we are getting there in a way that's consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel

confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've put out here, similar to delivering on the guidance we
gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then a second follow-up – or a follow-up, and then I'll re-queue with my other questions. Your CET1
ratio is 13% now, and I think that's two quarters earlier than consensus had expected. You said it was up 70 basis
points, so doesn't that allow you to repurchase stock now, or – I understand that if you go ahead and sell
Banamex, that could have a temporary negative capital hit, so I'm just thinking, like, don't sell Banamex, don't
have that temporary capital hit, start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value. So, what's wrong
with my logic or what part of that could you comment on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I'm going to jump in on the don't sell Banamex, Mike, as you could imagine. So, we're selling the consumer
franchise. It does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It's an emerging market consumer
franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multi-national clients and in institutions and high-net worth
individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly, and businesses that have strong connectivity
across the – between each other.
So, we are – we don't see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective, and when
we run all the math, it is in the shareholders' interests that we sell that franchise and flow that capital to our
shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns.
So, what you're suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we are taking,
we're very focused on our medium- and long-term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the
medium- and long-term.

I guess just one question, a follow-up on capital. As we think about post the second half of the year, let's say,
you've taken the hit from Banamex, but coming out of this stress test, any sense, Mark, if there's any reason why
Citi would have an outsized negative impact from the Basel end game reforms? Just give us a sense. I'm just
wondering, hopefully, we don't get another disappointment as we get our hopes high for the buybacks in the back

half and is there something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank? Would
love any perspective there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so, look, as we pointed out, we've built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are
ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on
that CET1 ratio, and we do obviously have a DFAST that's in front of us that we'll have to see what the outcome is
of that work.
I think the Basel end game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we'll have to
take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however
it plays out. And similar to [indiscernible] (00:53:35), we'll get after it in a very significant way to make sure that
we're able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this
point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren't final rules out just yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just back to your medium-term targets, I guess if you hit that the bending the curve at the end of 2024,
it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of $10 by 2025 even at the lower end of the
guidance. Am I missing anything there, or, like, does that make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I'd point out is what we've described, what I've described or Jane's described is the medium-term is
2024 through 2026, and we've given you guidance for 2023. We intend to get to those return targets in the
medium-term. I haven't given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we'll kind of take that
year-by-year. And so, just factor in I think what's important is you've got a view on 2023, and I think we've given
you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium-term, and I think that's important.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with Personal and Wealth Management. I know, Jane, earlier you
talked about the fact that – which you have announced looking for a new head to move that business forward.
Could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for
growth? Because there's a bunch of different pieces, some on the advice channel, some on the more fee channel,
some on the more balance sheet piece, and you already indicated US as an opportunity to expand into. So, I'd
just like to understand from your perspective which pieces are the most important to execute on and that could -
help us understand how you're planning on shaping this business going forward. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Great question, Betsy. And Mark and I are both smiling here, because I think the answer is all of the above. So, if
we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There's an important recovery that's going to
occur in Asia, and you can see from our results last year and across the board with other competitors with an
Asian bent, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of
COVID in that market compared to – broadly in Asia compared to the US. So, we see some exciting growth
opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board.
You're absolutely right. In the US, we start from a smaller scale there. We've been bringing different parts of that
business together. The Wealth at Work franchise is one that's had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we've
also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The
biggest upside there is investment products. I think we've got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were
particularly deposits from the margin lending and the like, mortgages, but this is really about the investment
offering in this space.
Then finally, I'd say there's also tremendous opportunity in the synergies. And we've been showing you this in
terms of linkages between our commercial banks, our banking franchise, the referrals up from the US personal
banking. We've had about 60,000 referrals this year in the US alone from that. Markets also provides important
referrals and even TTS. So, the client referrals, there are business synergies between them, common platforms,
so we really see an opportunity for this multi-dimensional growth drivers in Wealth over and above the recovery in
the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from.
And we'll continue investing in – appropriately in building out that front line as well. So, this is a very important part
of our strategy. We're excited about it. It's a key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well looking
at the medium term, and we're looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to
accelerate from here, or you've already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as
opposed to accelerating?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I think, look, at – in this current environment, we're – as we've – Mark and I have both said, since really the middle
of this year, this is something that we're pacing, but we're continuing to invest behind, and you can see that
18

growth in our client advisors. And remember that net growth in client advisors includes the divestiture we made in
Uruguay, for example. So, it's pretty strong.
We don't have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place and
it's more been a story of integrating them and then making sure that we're putting the right digital and other
investments behind it. But it's not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business, and we'll pace
that as appropriate with market conditions.
Mark, anything to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
One thing I'd add – Betsy, you know this. This is, in the normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high-
returning business and we've seen that in the past, and so we want to be well-positioned for – as the market
turns, having brought on client advisors, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions which are up
24% in 2022. And so, I think we're well-positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want
to be smart about how we deploy the dollars, and so we'll re-pace as necessary, but ensure that we're ready for
when things turn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And I'd just add it was a couple of years ago that we put – that we announced the strategy and started executing
on it, so we have the benefit of the historic investments that – we're seeing the drivers playing out well and as I
say, well, we should be well-positioned when the market turns here.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. I just want to follow up on the comments about expecting markets to be relatively flat in 2023. Obviously, a
very good 4Q, and I know at least I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in recent
quarters, and I think proved that not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue. But as you think
about 2023, like, the wallets have been strong in recent years. And to your point, your FICC leadership was
strong this year. How confident are you in kind of that flat markets and maybe what's driving that view? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
It's a markets business, right? And so, you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets
business. With that said, we've got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year. A very good
year this year. I think we're well-positioned with the client base. And we're well-positioned to maintain our number-
one position as we go into 2023.
Now, how that market and market wallet moves I think is going to predicate on a number of things, including how
the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and
the like. But again, I feel like we're well-positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out.

Equity derivatives, for example, was a real strength. This was an equity derivatives year. So this – and the
corporate worlds with the volatility that's out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength
of ours, and for better or for worse, we're expecting that strength to continue. It certainly seems to so far.

Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit, if you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step-down, but when
you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business versus your peers where they're seeing probably
lagging retail deposits in the US, pricing that's going to hurt second half NII, if we look at you guys, you already
have high betas, mostly institutional. You mentioned the benefit from non-US rates and you're growing deposits.
So why sort of the – a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on? Just
trying to think that through, because it doesn't look like the Legacy drag is very big in your chart.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Similar dynamics you say in 2023, or you're talking about the fourth quarter? I'm not sure I follow you.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
I'm just trying to talk about versus peers. Some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but
you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth, benefits from non-US rates, and a much higher
beta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so I think – I mean, I think I'd point to a couple of things on the NII side just as it relates to us. One,
importantly, that I mentioned and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we've got about 65%
or so are in ICG and the balance, 35% in our PBWM business. We certainly skew to US dollar, but we've got a
30% or so that is in non-US dollar, and when I think about the potential or look-forward curves or how rates will
likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-US side, right?
And so if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the US with
our corporate client segment, and so I think there's some repricing opportunities that we'll continue to actively
manage as we did here in the US. And so I do think it's that international footprint, the globality of our franchise
that plays to our strength in 2023.
The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view.
And that volume growth, you've seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in
interest-earning balances, and we'd expect that to continue particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see
payment rates start to temper. And so I think those things will be two major contributors.
Mix is obviously a factor, as you point out. We will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from Legacy,
but it's that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios that I think will be
important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
No, that's all fair, but I guess maybe I didn't phrase my question right. But if I look at ex-Markets, I think your
forecast for 2013 (sic) [2023] (01:06:18) would be less than the 4Q run rate ex-Markets, and yet you just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Well, just, you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise, so I'm just trying to get a
sense of what's driving the decline from 4Q levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think the thing you've got to pick up is really the Legacy Franchise and the NII. A large part of the Legacy
Franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover
there, and so I think that's the important element here that we haven't quantified to a dollar amount, but that is
explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously,
there's other factors, but that's important.

Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding – and this is true for your peers as well, the
normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit
losses? So when you look at branded cards or retail sales or Retail Services, how do you see that progressing
through 2023? One of your peers pointed out that they think by the end of 2023 they may be at that normalization
rate that they look to for their numbers, but I'm just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are
thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, but let me jump in, and then I'll hand it on to Mark. But I think we are expecting under the current trajectory
to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end early 2024 level. If you think of branded
cards, if I was to quantify [ph] it's sort of (01:08:16) of 20% of the way there now, CRS, we're about 40% of the
way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing – the loss sharing with our partners that helps
us, but I hope that gives you a sense around it.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Probably the most important driver, that we've been worried about, was very uncertain with what was happening
with payment rates, and I think we've got much more clarity [ph] because (01:08:44) they've started that
normalization path, so that's driving a fair amount of – more certainty around what the direction is happening
there. Frankly, the big question is more what's happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now
is the bigger uncertainty.
But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
...Mark, any other observations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I'd add is that, Gerard, you could see – just depending on how this plays out, you could see kind of
NCL rates tick up above normal levels...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
...and then come back down to normal levels has been the timeline that Jane described, again, just depending on
how the macro factors continue to play out. But, again, we – as we sit here and talk about these NCL rates, it's
important to point out as well that we're very well reserved across all of these portfolios, and so to some extent if
you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NCLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have
been established. But the trend line is exactly, as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick up
above normal levels and then it come back down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Also, this is such an unusual market in the sense that you've got such strong labor market driven by frankly a
supply shortage almost as much as demand, and we've also got the consumers with still very high savings that
they're dipping into and we're seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this. But
this is not going to be like a normal recession, it's why you're thinking here, us and others talking about the
manageability and the mildness of it likely if we do have one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And what kind of unemployment rates are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory? Is it we get to 5%
unemployment by first quarter 2024?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think a couple of things. So, one, our base-case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about, includes
kind of a mild recession in it just – and as we forecasted it. The downside would be something a bit more severe
than that. I'd say we're reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate just kind of overall when you look at –
when you average across the different scenarios that we have.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks. Just two quick questions here. The first one, just on Card. The Card NIM has been kind of flattish. I
know that obviously has to do with just how you show – how you internally allocate the funding towards it, but can
you just kind of talk us through what's happening either with rewards or either incremental teaser rates on some of
the new relationships, and should we see the Card NIM expand from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I'm not going to get into, Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in
the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the Card side. We've made very good traction and, Jane,
you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with American
and we've also launched a number of new products that, I think, is helping to fuel the growth that we've seen on
the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we've seen in spend rates as well as some of the
average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we've seen, but I really don't want to get into the NIM
guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, we have a fabulous Cards franchise, and when we look at strong track record in the digital, the
other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary
products as well as with our partners, and we're really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at
the moment, from custom cash that was 28% of new accounts acquisitions, so an important new product refresh
that's driving things, 80% of customers engaging digitally. Innovations like American is a fantastic partner of ours
really taking that to the next levels, and you can see that with the growth in spend in the category.
So I think there's a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the returns and the margins and the
other trajectories here. And as I say, a prime portfolio which is always a good thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. And my second question was there was an article about changing management up in the Wealth
Management business this week, and I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that
you're making inside the Wealth Management relative to your – the KPIs and the goals that you've discussed at
Analysts Day. Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, sure. I mean, two years ago I asked Jim O'Donnell to put the Wealth business together from the various
components that we had around the firm, and now as we move to the next phase for this as we've said this
strategically important business, I believe, it's the right time to change the leadership, also because Jim's going to
play an important role moving forward supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He's
got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, and he's going to be
helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm's full capabilities to these clients.
So I felt the time was right to make the move, and we will be, as indicated, swiftly moving to go out and have a
look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, it's business as usual as we go out and follow the
strategy that we have, and we're looking forward to the market turning, as I'm sure everyone is, and feel that we're
well-positioned to do so.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the topic of credit, one of your
peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume
6% unemployment under CECL. Can you – just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve
levels and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook
and potential growth math headwinds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, thank you. Why don't I take that? I'm not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you or here on the fly.
What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against three scenarios, that base
scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario, and upside scenario, and we weight both scenarios. And the
base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession, and in that baseline, unemployment was, call it, 4.4% or
so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario, unemployment in the downside
scenario got to a 6.9% or so, and then we had an upside scenario.
The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5%, 5.1% that I mentioned, and those were factors that
went into the reserve that we established in the quarter. And largely when you think about the weightings we put
on those scenarios, the weightings skewed towards that base and that downside.
The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around Cards,
and that really had to do – the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it
also reflects, as I mentioned earlier, a Cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that
are well-below what they would be in a normal cycle, and it does pick up the fact that there's volume growth that
we saw in the quarter there.
So I'm not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully that gives you some perspective as to what's
underneath the models that we've used to establish these reserves, and obviously we do that on a quarter-by-
quarter basis.

Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I'd also just jump in on one of the areas that sometimes gets misthought of about the firm is on the corporate
credit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, a good point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
When we look at our corporate client portfolio, don't equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint.
When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure are with multi-national firms and their subsidiaries,
and this is investment grade, so I think that's another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan
portfolio as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take, but I think it's
important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's really helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of our revenue targets for 2023
depends on some improvement in the environment, for example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound, and,
Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments. So if
the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers
you might be able to pull that might provide an offset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
It kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right? Because you could have – I don't
anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in Investment Banking, but you could also have continued
volatility in rates or currencies, and that could mean more upside than flat for the Markets business. So there are
a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out.
I think what's really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity
to them, and so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted
that we're often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year. It can vary from what's here. That's
what gives us the confidence to around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we've
talked about and really push execution, and that's exactly what we're doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And an important part of 2023 is not just the impact of the cycle, but also you'll see the impact of the different
investments that we've been making and you've certainly seen that, for example, in services this year, and we've
been very transparent around the 70 basis point increase we've seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up
to the third quarter. And so you've not only got drivers here in terms of what's happening in the market, but you've
also got the strategic drivers also taking in more and more together as Mark referred to the synergies.

open.

Hello, again, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Yeah, so one question, one follow-up. So you have a – your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by
midyear, but you're already there, so – and I guess if we go back to the Banamex thing, I guess, is that kind of
assuming potential capital impacts from divestitures, or why would you have a target six months out when you've
already met it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, Mike, I have to tell you, I'm surprised that you're asking about Mexico just given our history together, but I
understand it, and what I...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
...what I would say is that – a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right, and we're not happy
about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So if we
could buy back, right, if we could do buybacks – as soon as we're able to do buybacks, we will. Right? I mean that
is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders.
The second thing I would say is we did get to the 13% sooner, and that was, again, in accordance with executing
against our strategy and parts of our business, particularly the Markets business, has done a really good job at

delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA, and we've been able to get there without damaging
the franchise which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in
fixed income.
What's ahead of us as you rightfully pointed out is that we've got a number of exits that have to take place. There
are puts and takes across many of them, but Mexico in particular will have a temporary, temporary impact on our
CET1 ratio, and so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next two quarters, so that we can absorb
that. And we also want to make sure that we're positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of
quarters, and always but certainly over the next couple of quarters while we manage the headwind, temporary
headwind from that exit.
So hopefully that gives you a better sense for it, but we're actively managing this and we have not lost focus on
the importance of returning capital to shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I want to reiterate that as well. I mean, it's very important to us, and as Mark says, we know where we
trade. We've made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders' interests in compensation and
management interest, all these various dimensions, and we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we're
going to do and continue delivering against what we say we're going to be delivering and with the CTA impact
essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we're taking that into account.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. That's very clear. And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding Markets-related is higher for 2023, but I think
that implies a little step-down from the fourth quarter level. Not as much as – JPMorgan was guiding down 10%
for the fourth quarter level. I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from you being outside the US.
What are some of the ins and outs there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so you've got a couple of points here. So one is we won't see NII momentum as we've seen in 2022 just as
betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels. That's obviously going to slow or put pressure
on the pricing as we go into 2023, but some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization
of the rate hikes that happened late in the year, and so that'll be a plus in 2023.
You'll also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the US, and given
our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there'll be – volume will contribute to that NII growth particularly as
we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the Cards side.
The offset will be that the Legacy Franchises. Right? And so as those exits occur, as the wind-downs continue, as
I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII, and so we'll have to grow over that, and we will grow
over that to kind of get to the target that we've set. So those are the puts and takes.
