Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. The second quarter was another strong one in which we
achieved net income of $151 million, $8 million lower than the first quarter results of $159 million. Net interest
income and noninterest income remained strong. The decrease in net income was driven by higher operating
expenses, offset in part by a lower provision for credit losses. We grew loan balances by $693 million during the
quarter.
Banco Popular generated loan growth across all segments, while Popular Bank achieved growth in commercial
and construction loans offset in part by runoff in the mortgage and consumer portfolios. Year-to-date, loan
balances have grown by more than approximately $953 million. Our net interest margin decreased by 8 basis
points to 3.14% in the quarter, primarily as a result of a 29 basis point increase in deposit costs. This was partially
offset by higher loan balances and the repricing of adjustable rate loans in a higher interest rate environment, as
well as higher balance of money market investments driven by our strong deposit growth.
Noninterest income continue to improve. Excluding the $7 million insurance claim reimbursement recorded in the
first quarter, fee income was $5 million higher. Revenues related to customer transaction activity were particularly
strong, and we also began to see some early results from our various transformation initiatives. Operating
expenses increased by $20 million as we continue to strategically invest in our people, in areas such as
regulatory compliance and technology, and projects related to our transformation.
Credit quality trends remain positive. NPLs once again decreased in the period, and net charge-offs remain well
below pre-pandemic levels. We maintained robust liquidity, anchored by our deposit franchise and our high levels
of cash reserves and unpledged securities. Overall, deposits were up $3.1 billion in the quarter, and liquidity
sources increased by $1.9 billion. We have a well-diversified deposit franchise in Puerto Rico with an average
balance of less than $10,000 per retail account.
Our total consolidated borrowings remained flat during the quarter. Regulatory capital levels remained strong. Our
common equity Tier 1 ratio in the second quarter was 16.9%. Additionally, tangible book value per share ended
the quarter at $51.37, an increase of $1.22 per share. Earlier this month, we announced that in August 14, we will
redeem at par all outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes that mature in
September of 2023.
Please turn to slide 4. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by approximately 9,500 during the quarter,
reaching nearly 2 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers remained
strong. Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million or 56% of our customer base.
In addition, we continue to capture more than 60% of our deposits through digital channels. This trend remains
significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating our customers' adoption of this technology. In the
second quarter, consumer spending remained healthy, with combined credit and debit card sales up 3%
compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our auto and lease originations increased by 29% compared to the first
quarter as demand for cars has continued to be strong in Puerto Rico.
Mortgage production in Puerto Rico appears to have stabilized in the second quarter. The dollar value of
mortgage originations at Banco Popular increased by 20% compared to the second quarter of last year, driven
primarily by home purchase activity. The Puerto Rico economy performed well during the second quarter.
Business activity is solid and remains in good shape, as reflected in the continued positive trends in total
employment and other economic data.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
The tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength for the local economy. Year-to-date, San
Juan Airport has seen record levels of passenger traffic. Hotel demand has also been very strong. Year-to-date,
occupancy, average daily rates and RevPAR are all at the highest level seen in nearly a decade. There are still
approximately $45 billion of hurricane disaster recovery funds yet to be disbursed. We expect that these funds will
support economic activity in many sectors in the coming years. In fact, we are beginning to see these funds being
disbursed into local construction projects. As this infrastructure investment in the economy expands, we are well-
positioned to serve the needs of our customers and benefit from such activity.
In short, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, particularly our strong loan growth in both Puerto Rico
and in the US, as well as the continued strength of our deposit base, liquidity, and credit quality. We're
encouraged by the resiliency of the US economy and strong economic activity in Puerto Rico. We remain
optimistic about the future of Puerto Rico, our primary market, and our ability to manage and serve the needs of
our growing customer base.
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Please turn to slide 5. We reported net income of $151 million compared to $159 million in
Q1. Net interest income was $532 million in line with Q1. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was
$558 million, down $12 million from Q1 due to a higher disallowed interest expense in the calculation of taxes in
Puerto Rico.
Noninterest income was $160 million, a $2 million decrease from Q1, which included a $7 million insurance claim
reimbursement. Excluding the Q1 reimbursement, during the quarter, noninterest income increased by $5 million
driven by customer activity. Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $3 million, mainly due to higher
cash management fees on commercial customer accounts. Additionally, other service fees increased by $4
million, primarily driven by higher credit and debit card fees due to higher volume of customer transactions.
Going forward, we expect noninterest income to be approximately $155 million to $160 million per quarter. The
increase from our prior $150 million quarterly guidance is partly due to two transformation-related initiatives that
have yielded early results. First, we have enhanced the pricing segmentation in our commercial cash
management business in Puerto Rico. And second, last year, we introduced a commercial credit card product for
Puerto Rico SME businesses. Both initiatives have contributed additional fee income.
The provision on our credit losses was $37 million compared to $48 million in the first quarter. Total operating
expenses were $640 million (sic) [$460 million] (00:08:48) in Q2, an increase of $20 million from the prior quarter.
This increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees by $17 million related to regulatory compliance and
cyber security initiatives, as well as technology and software expenses that increased by $4 million. During Q2,
we incurred $7 million of transformation-related expenses compared to $6 million last quarter. We continue to
anticipate transformation-related expenses of approximately $50 million in 2023 as these efforts are expected to
accelerate in the second half of the year.
Other large expense variances were higher business promotion expense by $6 million, mostly related to credit
card customer loyalty programs, higher processing and transactional services expenses by $4 million due to retail
credit and debit card replacement costs. And finally, lower personnel costs by $7 million, primarily related to lower
equity-based compensation expenses. Personnel costs historically exhibited a seasonal decrease in the second

quarter, then typically increase for the remainder of the year, in part due to the impact of annual merit increases,
which are effective on July 1.
Our quarterly expense trajectory has historically ramped up as the year progresses. We anticipate that 2023 will
be consistent with our experience and continue to expect expenses for the year of approximately $1.87 billion. We
will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%. For
the full year 2023, we now expect an effective tax rate to be between 22% and 25%. This range is somewhat
tighter than the 21% to 26% range provided during our last webcast.
Please turn to slide 6. Net interest income was $532 million. On a taxable equivalent basis, it was $558 million,
$12 million lower than in the first quarter. Net interest margin decreased by 8 basis points to 3.14% in Q2. On a
taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 3.29%, a decrease of 17 basis points versus Q1. The decrease is driven by
higher interest expense on deposits due to the increase in balance of cost of public sector deposits, as well as
growth in high cost deposit accounts at Popular Bank. This was partially offset by higher loan yields and balances
across all major lending categories.
At the end of the second quarter, public sector deposits were roughly $18.5 billion, an increase of $3 billion
compared to Q1. The increase in Q2 was consistent with historical trends, and as such, by the end of 2023, we
still expect deposits, public deposits to be in the range of $14 billion to $16 billion. It is important to reiterate that
by law in Puerto Rico, public deposits must be 100% collateralized. While changes in the level of these deposits
may impact profitability, they do not have a significant impact on our liquidity. Excluding Puerto Rico public
deposits, customer deposit balances were essentially unchanged in the quarter. We did, however, see some mix
shift as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by $624 million in the quarter. This was offset by increases in
time and saving deposits of Popular Bank gathered through a direct online channel.
In Q2, we continue to see commercial and high net worth clients pursuing better yields on excess liquidity by
moving these funds outside the banking sector. However, we have been able to capture a good portion of these in
our broker dealer which saw inflows from deposit customers of approximately $350 million in Q2. Our ending loan
balances increased by $693 million compared to Q1, driven by growth in all loan segments at BPPR and by
commercial and construction loans at PB. This growth is net of a transfer to held for sale of a $46 million private
label credit card portfolio. That portfolio was sold at par value in early Q3. We are encouraged by the demand for
credit at BPPR and PB. We will continue to take advantage of [ph] prudent (00:13:17) opportunities to extend
credit and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity.
Our interest rate sensitivity continues to be relatively neutral. As this year progresses, we expect the margin to
resume an upward trajectory. The timing will depend on our loan and deposit growth and mix, investment portfolio
strategy, and the pace of repricing of public and incrementally retail and commercial deposits. Deposit betas in
the current [indiscernible] (00:13:46) cycle are now above the prior cycle. We have seen a total cumulative
deposit beta of 31% to date in this cycle. In BPPR, total deposit costs increased by 34 basis points compared to
an increase of 35 basis points in Q1, led by public sector deposits. Excluding the public sector balances, deposit
costs in BPPR increased by 14 basis points. In PB, deposit costs increased by 55 basis points versus 67 basis
points in Q1, led by retail deposits gathered primarily through our online channel.
In Puerto Rico, our combined retail and commercial deposit betas cycle to-date continue to be less than 10%.
Given the increase in short-term interest rate, we expect a continued increase in the cost of public sector
deposits. The deposit pricing agreement with the Puerto Rico public sector is market linked with a lag. This source
of funding results in an attractive spread under market rates. In the second quarter, the cost of public sector
deposits increased by 39 basis points compared to our April estimate of 60 basis points [indiscernible] (00:15:02)

and the mechanics of the interest expense calculation. We expect the cost of public deposits to increase by
approximately 50 basis points in Q3.
Please turn to slide 8. Our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage-
backed securities, which carry minimal credit risk. Including our cash position, this portfolio has an average
duration of approximately 2.3 years. As of the end of the second quarter, the balance of the unrealized loss in our
HTM portfolio stood at $746 million, a reduction of $43 million from Q1. We expect this loss will be amortized back
into capital throughout the remaining life of that portfolio, at a rate of approximately 5% per quarter through 2026.
Please turn to slide 9. Our return on tangible equity was 10.6% in the quarter. Regulatory capital levels remain
strong. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q2 of 16.9% increased by 14 basis points from Q1. Tangible book
value per share at quarter end was $51.37, an increase of $1.22 per share. Given the continued uncertainty on
the outlook for rates, the economy and the potential regulatory response to invest in the banking sector, we do not
expect to engage in a share repurchase during the remainder of 2023. We do plan, however, to consider a
dividend increase later this year. We'll review future capital actions as market conditions evolve. Our long-term
outlook on capital return has not changed, and of course, on our strong regulatory capital ratios. Over time, we
expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the level of our mainland peers plus the spread.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continue to exhibit strong credit quality trends with low
levels of net charge-offs and decreasing non-performing loans. We believe that the improvements over the last
few years in the risk profile of the corporation's loans portfolio positions Popular to operate successfully in the
current environment. However, we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance and the
macroeconomic environment, even inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks.
Before discussing the credit metrics for the quarter, I would like to address the risk profile of three loan segments:
office CRE, credit cards and auto and lease financing portfolio. We have also included additional information for
these segments in the appendix to today's presentations. The office segment is receiving a lot of attention in the
current environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. Popular consolidated office area
exposure is limited, representing only 1.8% or $600 million of our total loan portfolio and is mainly comprised of
low to mid-rise properties located in suburban areas and is well-diversified across tenant type with an average
loan size of $2 million. We have no exposure to large office tenant CRE in the mainland urban city centers. The
portfolio has a favorable credit risk profile with low levels of NPLs and classified loans. In terms of our credit card
and auto and lease portfolios, the credit risk profile of these portfolios is anchored on the strength of the job
market and economic activities in Puerto Rico, coupled with the credit quality of our originations over the last few
years.
In terms of credit cards, 30-plus delinquency is at 2.8%, compared to an average of 3.7% in the 2011-2019 pre-
pandemic period. And year-to-date, net charge-offs are at 2.4%, compared to an average of 3.7% in the pre-
pandemic period. In terms of auto loans, 30-plus delinquency is at 3.7% compared to an average of 6.2% in the
2011-2019 period. And year-to-date, net charge-offs are at 60 basis points compared to an average of 1.9% in the
pre-pandemic period. For lease financing, 30-plus delinquency is at 1.3%, compared to an average of 2.1% in the
2011-2019 period. And year-to-date, net charge-offs are at 20 basis points compared to an average of 70 basis
points in the pre-pandemic period.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Turning to slide number 10. Non-performing assets decreased by $32 million to $472 million this quarter, driven
by an NPL decrease in Puerto Rico of $27 million due to lower mortgage NPLs by $30 million, offset in part by
higher construction NPLs due to a single $9 million relationship. OREO balances also decreased by $6 million.
NPL inflows decreased by $10 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower commercial NPLs in Puerto Rico by
$30 million and lower mortgage NPLs in Puerto Rico by $7 million, offset in part by the previously mentioned
construction NPL relationship. Inflows in the US remain flat quarter-over-quarter. At the end of the quarter, the
ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio decreased to 1.2% from 1.3% in the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-off amounted to $24 million, were annualized 29 basis points of average
loans held in portfolio compared to $33 million or 41 basis points in the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter
improvement was driven by a $10.5 million line of credit charge-off in the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 12. At June 30, 2023, the ACL increased by $11 million to $700 million, driven by
portfolio changes due to higher specific reserves, higher volume, and change in the FICO mix of customer
portfolios. Changes in the macroeconomic scenario caused the ACL to increase by $8 million, which were offset
in part by a change in the mix and the probability weight of macroeconomic scenarios by $6 million. During the
second quarter, we lowered the probability weights assigned to a pessimistic scenario and increased the
probability weight assigned to the baseline scenario. Changes to qualitative reserves reduced the ACL by $5
million.
The provision for credit losses was $37 million, compared to $48 million in the prior quarter. In Puerto Rico, the
provision was $28 million compared to $45 million in the prior quarter, while the provision for the US was $7
million compared to $2 million. The corporation ratio of ACLs to loans held in portfolio remained flat at 2.1%, while
the ratio of ACL to NPL stood at 182% compared to 167% in the previous quarter.
To summarize, our loan portfolio continue to exhibit strong credit quality trends in the second quarter with low net
charge-offs and decreasing non-performing loans. We remain attentive to the evolving environment but remain
encouraged by the post-pandemic performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates. Our results for the first half of 2023 were strong, driven by solid
earnings, robust loan growth, positive credit quality, and continued customer growth. Our diversified business
model, robust levels of capital, and most importantly, the talent and dedication of our people position us well to
support and meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base. We're optimistic about the opportunities that
lie ahead.
Economic trends in Puerto Rico continue to be positive. A considerable amount of recovery funds yet to be
disbursed are expected to support increased economic activity in the coming years. We made progress on our
transformation initiatives during the quarter, which over time will drive more customer connectivity, operational
efficiencies, and greater potential for profitable growth and sustained return on capital. In June, we released our
Annual Corporate Sustainability Report. We continue to focus on providing opportunity for progress, protecting the
environment and promoting leadership. We are mindful of the responsibility we have to Puerto Rico as the leading
banking institution and to all the communities that we proudly serve.
We are now ready to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Timur Braziler from Wells Fargo.
Timur, your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Maybe...

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...starting on the loan growth, that's remained quite strong now for many consecutive quarters. I'm just wondering,
as you look ahead, is this kind of where we're at for the foreseeable future or just given the remaining
idiosyncratic tailwinds for the island, does loan growth actually accelerate as some of these construction projects
you referenced come online?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, Timur, this is Ignacio. [indiscernible] (00:25:19), it's always hard to project and forecast loan growth in
Puerto Rico. It's coming and it's very lumpy, especially the larger loans that drive some of the growth. But what I
can say is that we continue to have good pipelines, good demand from our customers. We're not seeing that
decrease. So, again, I don't want to put a percentage level on it, but we have strong loan demand both in Puerto
Rico and the US. So I wouldn't put a number on it, but we certainly don't see it decelerating at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then as far as appetite for mainland credit, the growth in construction, I'm assuming that's contractual
loans funding up. And then just maybe speak more broadly about appetite and growing the mainland portfolio in
the face of what's expected to be an uncertain credit environment in the back end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Lidio could add more to that. But I want to point out that we've always been a construction lender,
especially in the New York metro area, but we're not very involved in the office sector. So we're mostly – most of
our construction is around multifamily. So, I think we'll continue to be prudent and lending to existing clients. But I
don't see us pulling back from our traditional markets that we serve. Again, we're not in the office sector. I don't
know, Lidio, if you want to add anything [indiscernible] (00:26:48).

I think that's perfect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe switching to the funding of this loan growth, so given the seasonal trends and public funds
and those coming down in the back end of the year, coupled with the loan to deposit ratio that still has plenty of
room to move higher, is there a wantingness to fund the upcoming loan growth through incremental deposits, or
are you okay borrowing at this level and funding the new growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Hi, Timur. Carlos. So at this point in time, we do have a very strong liquidity position. So everything else being
equal, our [ph] first quarter call (00:27:33) would be our cash to fund our loan growth. We are very lucky that the
yields on our loan book are quite attractive. So they're even more attractive than the yields we can achieve and
still on our investment portfolio. So, that would be first call. At this point in time, I don't envision us having
significant borrowings to fund loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then last for me. Just on the expenses, any color you can provide on the profit sharing
component? Pretty big quarter relative to Street expectations, and I know Street is kind of the proxy that you have
used in the past for determining whether or not we're going to have profit sharing contribution. But your comments
on hoping to come in better than that [ph] 187 (00:28:31), I'm just wondering what the outlook is for profit sharing
in relation to that comment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
At this point in time, there is no consideration of profit sharing in our numbers.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. Thank you. I'll step back.

Please proceed with your question.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone. I want to just ask on the FTE adjustment. I guess I was a little bit perplexed this
quarter, the FTE adjustment keeps moving a bit lower, but the tax rate was kind of flattish and it looked like you
kind of narrowed the guidance range a little bit, I guess. Can you maybe explain again the dynamics between
what's happening with the FTE adjustment and the tax rate at this point?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Hi. This is Jorge García. Good morning. It is a complicated question, I don't blame you. The first thing I will say is
that the disallowance of our interest expense, which is really what drives that FTE adjustment, is increasing giving
that the cost of deposits are increasing. So that's the first impact that you're seeing. Essentially, your tax free
income is becoming less. Your other question is why aren't we seeing a change necessarily in our effective tax
rate, and that has to do with GAAP accounting, where you try to anticipate changes in that effective tax rate
throughout the year and you make adjustments for that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, so you normalize it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe just shifting to deposit costs. I think you provided the betas, the cumulative betas for the interest
bearing portions cycle to date for the retail, commercial, and public deposits. I know the public is going to be
100% with the lag. But just on the commercial and retail side, just wanted to get your thoughts, if you have any,
on where you thought those betas would end the year by the fourth quarter of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Well, it depends in part on what the Fed does today and what the Fed does the rest of the year, frankly. I
think the trends are trends that can be expected to continue, meaning that our betas in Puerto Rico will continue
to be lower in our retail and commercial businesses. Commercial, slightly higher; retail, a lot lower. Then
[indiscernible] (00:31:36) market betas. And then we'll have a beta that's slightly higher or closer to market
averages in our bank in the US. So, I think those trends will probably continue to the extent that the Fed has done
this afternoon. We'll – then that will affect how it looks for the rest of the year.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last one for me for right now is just on the securities book. I'm sorry if you already touched on
it and I missed it. Just want to get your thoughts on how that's going to ebb and flow and uses of securities, cash
flows at this point for the remainder of the year. You had negative growth the first three quarters of this year. Just
wondering if we're going to continue to use that as a source of liquidity going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. We've been cautious with – and actually have been building cash because of the uncertainty in the last
couple of quarters. Brody, I think we'll feel a lot better then, a lot of that is behind us now. So what you should see
starting this quarter is that we'll start to redeploy some of the cash. We'll probably end up with lower cash
balances, hopefully, because we have a lot of loans first. But even without that, we'll start to redeploy some of that
cash. It may not change – the profile of the investment portfolio is too much because some of that redeployment
will probably be in T-bills where the yield is going to be similar and then the liquidity will be basically cash like, but
it will provide us a tax benefit.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Thank you for that.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Just keeping on that last question on the tax rate and on the T-bills, does the tax rate range that you've
provided, the 22% to 25%, does that anticipate any additional investment into T-bills as the year progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That range incorporates our best guess of what we're going to do with the balance sheet the rest of the
year. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then I got to dig into just the comments on the buyback a little bit. Can you just – sort of I know there's
obviously a lot of uncertainty in the banking environment. But is it specifically uncertain around new capital rules
for CCAR banks? Is it specifically around waiting to see how credit develops or kind of what are the trigger
points? And then maybe just remind us how the process works if you do go through and raise the dividend. Is it a
similar process to your normal capital plans, or is it different in any way from – what you normally go through each
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Okay. Let me kind of walk through some thoughts on capital to – I think we'll try – kind of address a lot of your
questions, Alex. I mean, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to consider a dividend increase in
2023 probably late in the third quarter of this year. And at this time, we – no buyback is planned for the rest of this
year. Obviously, the final decision on any dividend increase rests with our board of directors, so they'll have the
final call on that.
We've described sort of our thinking process in the past that as we look at capital action, it depends on us getting
– we're looking for three things to inform our actions. Number one, clarity on the path of interest rates. Number
two, clarity on the path for the economy. And lastly, clarity in the path for regulation. Those are sort of the inputs
that help us make decisions.
Now, it is still uncertain – I mean, we're getting some information from the Fed tomorrow on capital, which would
be a nice first step to start adding some clarity to the process. By the way, we're getting information on capital

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
[indiscernible] (00:36:04) anything on one liquidity framework that may change which is also pretty important as
we think this through. But we'll start getting some information from – on that front at least hopefully tomorrow and
then will start informing some of the uncertainty here. So it's unclear exactly when we'll get clarity in these
matters, but those are the inputs that we're looking for. Additionally, while it's not a required regulatory ratio with
TCE and therefore AOCI, our consideration is in our decision-making process, so that is the consideration.
What I can say today as far as the process, which is the second part of your question, is that presently, we do not
plan to return to our historical cadence of a yearly capital actions announcement in January. Instead, while still not
decided, moving forward, we will probably shift to a capital management process that is closer to what most other
banks do, where we will periodically announce stock repurchase authorization that may be executed from time to
time. So, this is – so what we can tell you so far and the process, the – we always advise the regulators on
anything we're doing with regards to capital and we're no different this time, and hopefully would get back to you
later in the third quarter with a decision on the dividend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's good information. And then just in terms of that process, like suppose we got some clarity on rates
as early as today and some clarity on regulation tomorrow and – economy, we're never going to get clarity on. But
how long would it take you to actually go through that – like the whole process with the Fed? Is that something
that is a pretty quick thing? I remember when you guys did the Evertec thing. This seems like the approval
happened basically almost overnight. I'm just curious if that's evolved and gotten any easier over the years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the Fed always has the option to decide everything on their timetable. But the fact is that we've
been working very effectively with our regulators over the last few years. Frankly, you've seen it and what you
mentioned on the approval on Evertec is a reflection of it, that we try to work closely with them. We try to never
surprise them. They are always informed of what we're trying to do. And if they have to be involved, we – they
have been very responsive in working with us if we have a timetable that we're trying to meet. So, our relationship
is very good. And over the years, they've gotten better at understanding what we're doing. We've gotten better
asking the right questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then one final question for me. I wanted to just sort of dig into sort of conversation we haven't talked
about in probably a couple of conference calls about M&A in the North American franchise. And it just seems to
me like we're hearing anecdotally and seeing more announcements of loan sales, some of them related to
specific asset classes that you may or may not want to be into, some of them related to rates. But it seems like
there's going to be potentially a bunch of loan sales coming up, even some from the FDIC. They're going to be
potentially coming at pretty big discounts. I'm curious, you guys have tons of capital in North America. If you have
appetite to do some loan purchases, and if so, what the criteria might be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. This is Ignacio. I think we've said it before, we view ourselves as opportunistic buyers of assets. So there is
pools of assets that interests us. We will definitely go there. I think the assets that would interest us would be
mostly those things that we are – that we feel we have a certain level of expertise in. So we have a certain level of

expertise in CRE, our healthcare financing, the condominium association financing. Those are things that would
be of interest to us. So we're not going to buy office portfolios at a discount, that kind of thing. Even if it's a very
attractive, we're not going to do something that's not something that we have a particular level of expertise. I don't
think we'd probably go after mortgage assets either, so I think it'd be more in the commercial area. But if there are
attractive assets in those areas that we feel we know well, we would be interested to look at them. Sure.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thank you so much for the questions, and good morning. I thought I would just close the loop on the capital
discussion. I appreciate the commentary that you're reviewing the dividend now. Can you remind us what you
guys can sort of target in terms of your dividend payout ratio and how we should be thinking about that as we
review the dividends here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. There is – I mean, what we target is what we hear from regulators, which seems to be something bordering
around 30% of income. So that's what we're trying to target. A couple of recent announcements have taken banks
slightly above that, so we're attentive to that. We also don't know what their forecasts are, so they may end up at
30% depending on what they have there, how they're looking at the year. But that's the broad guide is what we
understand to be the regulatory preference that dividends be around that level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. And this is Ignacio. We try to make the dividends – do it a little bit every year so that we don't have a big
ramp-up in one year. So we try to do it incrementally, and I think we've been very successful in the past in doing
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Appreciate the color. I did want to flip to the deposit base, specifically the core deposit base,
excluding the government deposits. It looks like there, most of the growth came from the US. Can you kind of
walk us through your strategy there and any deposit campaigns you're running? And as we look ahead with
excess liquidity in Puerto Rico still high but – [ph] and really funding (00:43:09) coming in, but obviously, where
we are in the cycle, just kind of outlook for how much higher liquidity balances or whatever you want to call it is
left, and what we should be thinking about the deposit outlook, putting those dynamics together?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. As I mentioned in the earlier question, Kelly, I think it's fair to assume that our cash balances will be coming
down in the rest of the year from where they are today. The biggest part of the deposit increase this quarter was
still public sector deposits in Puerto Rico. And then there's a good chunk at Popular Bank. We continue to try to
strengthen the deposit business of Popular Bank. So that is a focus of the company. The efforts actually – the
most obvious efforts are the increase in deposits through our online channel because that reacts quickly.
But there's another – a bunch of other business efforts intended to actually improve the deposit business of
Popular Bank as well. The problem with those is that they are less visible because they move slower. So that is
not the only tool we have to improve the deposit business, which is our goal. We are moving different levers. This
lever happens to be the most obvious one, obviously, because it's the one that moves the quickest.

I was just saying in terms of Puerto Rico – yeah, in terms of Puerto Rico, while deposits have gone down
somewhat, the average balances of our retail and small business clients especially are still way above pre-
pandemic levels. So we don't – I don't think we view the necessity of – is starting to have aggressive marketing
campaigns in Puerto Rico at this point, given our deposit levels.

Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital. Gerard, your line is now
open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Ignacio, Lidio, and Carlos.
[indiscernible] (00:45:43)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Ignacio, can you guys give us some color. Obviously, Puerto Rico over the years has had a healthy
manufacturing component to your economy. I know in your prepared remarks that you talked about tourism and
how well that's going in. In stateside, there's clear evidence of the onshoring of manufacturing coming back to
Ohio or Indiana, or et cetera. Are you guys seeing any evidence of the benefit of that possibly coming to Puerto
Rico?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
The manufacturing sector based on the Economic Activity Index is relatively healthy in Puerto Rico. It's been
growing. Sometimes it goes up for a few quarters, then it goes down a bit. But frankly, it's been mostly in our
traditional sectors. The medical device sector which has been very strong in Puerto Rico. Also the aerodynamic
area, the technology relating to airplanes and motors and that kind of thing is very popular in the West Coast. I
haven't seen to date many brand new – at the beginning of the last year, we saw a couple of foreign firms come
in, an Indian company, I believe, a Mexican company. So we've seen some foreign firms that don't have, perhaps,
any presence in the US using Puerto Rico as their initial point, especially in the pharmaceutical – the generic
pharmaceutical side. But to be honest, I haven't seen a big impact from the onshoring yet. We had a big promise
for that, but it's been – mostly the dynamism has been in the – and there are traditional sectors that have been
growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, I believe the PREPA bankruptcy schedule was suspended in June. Do you
guys have any updates on what's going on there with the bankruptcy of PREPA and the resolution, that is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Not really. We don't know really more than we read in the press. I mean, we're optimistic that the most recent
proposal will get approved. Obviously, it means they're cutting the debt down more and the rates will obviously
have to go up less than on the prior plan. So we're optimistic that we can get this behind us, but really, we don't
have a lot of inside [indiscernible] (00:48:07) on what's going on there behind the scenes.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And I apologize if you addressed this, I came late onto the call, but did you guys – Carlos, give us the burn-
down rate for the next couple of years of the bond portfolio? What percentage of it will pay off by now in the end of
2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Senior Vice President & Corporate Comptroller, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's on page 8 of the deck, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Senior Vice President & Corporate Comptroller, Popular, Inc.
So that [indiscernible] (00:48:34). Yeah. So, I mean, it's some pretty aggressive roll-down in the treasury portfolio
for the next two years. MBSes, they'll be kind of present there. They're playing very slowly. So that's something
that, as Carlos mentioned, if you have a rate reversal and prepayments, they start to pick up again, you could see
some acceleration there. But we're not necessarily forecasting that. They have about $8 billion. So, that's an AFS
in treasuries, that has an average life of around a year and a half. So that'll kind of give you an idea of how that
rolls in. As Carlos mentioned just complementing that, we'd probably be at least for now reinvesting some of those
proceeds with T-bills. Treasury curve's inverted, so actually picking up yields a bit, doing that and maintaining a
relatively shorter portfolio as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just lastly, the way the balance sheet is positioned today, if – when we're on this call a year
from now, let's say, next July, what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for Popular over the next 12
months, both long and short end of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Senior Vice President & Corporate Comptroller, Popular, Inc.
I guess, I could answer that. Basically, if we have like a reduction in short-term rates, that's going to reduce the –
what we pay on the public sector deposits. As Carlos mentioned as well, it's a market linked with a lag, so you'd
see some pressure coming down from our cost deposits from that standpoint and a steepening. So any kind of
intermediate level assets kind of repricing at a higher spread to short term rates is naturally what typically a bank
likes. But our positioning is relatively neutral right now. So we don't – we're not really expecting major swings due
to interest rates, at least in our current balance sheet positioning.
