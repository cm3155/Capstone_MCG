Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mark. Let me join and welcome you to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Amid the ongoing public
health crisis, I hope you and your families are healthy and well.
At Northern Trust, we continue to operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we're focused on
providing our clients continuity of service while over 90% of our employees worldwide are working remotely. In
this environment, we have adapted to a new normal as to how we serve and communicate with our clients.
Though challenging, the transition across each of our businesses has been effective.
Within Wealth Management, earlier this year, we introduced the Northern Trust Institute, the embodiment of the
intellectual capital of our Wealth Management business, drawn from our experience serving the most affluent

individuals and families in the world. It combines and integrates the best thinking of our firm across 34 practices,
including areas such as investments, fiduciary, banking, planning, family business, philanthropy, and governance.
We have also published a number of insights and research pieces covering timely topics in the current
environment, including family governance, philanthropy, commercial real estate investing, and the upcoming US
election. Lastly, we've been very encouraged by the client and prospect participation in our digital Navigate the
Now campaign, which is driving more engagement.
Our asset management business is seeing considerable market share gains during 2020 within our liquidity
products, which have strategically been positioned over time. We've also experienced recent success in our
active and index fixed income and tax advantage equity products. We manage nearly $100 billion in assets
globally under ESG mandates where our strong capabilities position us for future growth in this space.
Within asset servicing, as we've mentioned previously, we did see a deferral in implementation activity from the
end of the first quarter and into the most recent quarter. However, the pipeline is strong and opportunities have
increased, as clients and prospects have adapted and become more comfortable operating in the current virtual
environment. Recent notable public wins include Treehouse Capital Management and Federated Mutual
Insurance Company in the US; Marks & Spencer Pension Trust in the UK; Hannover Re, a European based
insurer; and Aussiemove Limited for its funds in the Middle East.
We continually develop our solution-based services to support the needs of our clients, with two recent examples
being enhancements to our ESG analytics capabilities to support our clients oversight, risk, and exposures; and
the launch of dynamic valuation and reporting tools for asset owners using our innovative Front Office Solutions
product. We also continue to build our positioning in the outsourcing space, most notably in outsource foreign
exchange and trade execution.
Finally, we just recently published our latest corporate social responsibility report detailing our progress toward
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; enhancing our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy; and launching
client-focused ESG tools and investment vehicles, as I previously mentioned.
As we move forward in the current and persistent low interest rate environment, we'll accelerate our focus in two
areas. First, we will continue to drive greater efficiencies with a focus on technology solutions to drive productivity
gains. Second, from a growth perspective, we are focused on doing more with our existing client base and also
bringing on new clients to allow us to continue to grow organically in a scalable, profitable manner.
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our staff whose commitment, expertise, and professionalism
throughout these extraordinary times has been exceptional.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter.

Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before I
start, I would also like to take a brief moment to recognize all those affected by this ongoing crisis, especially
those working on the front line. Our thoughts are with you, and we hope you and your loved ones remain safe and
healthy.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Now, let's dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter
net income of $294.5 million. Earnings per share were $1.32 a share, and our return on average common equity
was 10.5%. The quarter included a $43.4 million pre-tax charge related to a corporate action processing error.
The issue was identified internally by our corporate actions team and to put the impacted clients in the same
position as they would have been if the error had not occurred. We executed open market transactions which
resulted in the loss.
You can see on the bottom of page 2, equity markets, particularly domestic US markets, performed well during
the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels.
And both the S&P 500 and EAFE local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations. It's worth
noting that on a year-over-year basis the EAFE local index remains negative, which creates an unfavorable
impact to our fees compared to the prior year. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-month
LIBOR rates continued to decline during the quarter.
Let's move on to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was
down 3%, with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income down 21%. Expenses increased 6%. The
provision for credit losses was $500,000 in the current quarter. Net income was down 23%.
In a sequential comparison, revenue declined 1%, with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income down
11.4%. Expenses increased 6% and net income declined 6%. Return on average common equity was 10.5% for
the quarter, down from 14.9% a year ago and 12.2% in the prior quarter.
Assets under custody and administration, $13.1 trillion, grew 13% from a year ago and increased 8% on a
sequential basis. Assets under custody of $10.1 trillion grew 16% from a year ago and increased 9% on a
sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, up 9% from a year ago and up 4% on a sequential
basis.
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year and down 1% sequentially. Trust investment
and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1 billion and were up 3%
from last year and 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $62 million in the quarter, up 3% year-
over-year and down 14% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was primarily driven by higher
volatility, while the sequential decline was impacted by lower volumes and lower volatility.
The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $91 million in the quarter, up 7% compared to one year
ago and down 10% sequentially. Securities, commissions, and trading income decreased 10% compared to a
year ago and was down 22% sequentially. Both year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily due to
lower interest rate swap activity and referral fees.
Other operating income increased 19% compared to the prior year and was down 5% sequentially. The increase
compared to the prior year was driven by higher income related to a bank-owned life insurance program, as well
as higher miscellaneous income, primarily associated with a market value increase in the supplemental
compensation plans. This higher income resulted in a related increase within the other operating expenses.
The sequential performance was impacted by a lower market value adjustment for a seed capital investment
relative to the prior quarter, partially offset by lower Visa swap expense. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in
more detail later, was $336 million in the third quarter, down 21% from a year ago and down 11.4% sequentially.

Let's look at components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services
business, these totaled $585 million in third quarter and were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.
Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $395 million, and up 1% year-
over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable
currency translation and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets. The sequential increase is primarily
driven by favorable currency translation, as well as favorable markets.
Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $12.3 trillion at quarter-end, up 13% year-over-
year and up 8% sequentially. Total year-over-year and sequential increases were attributable to new business,
favorable markets, and favorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $137 million in
the third quarter were up 19% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily
driven by strong flows within our money market funds. The sequential increase is primarily driven by the impact of
favorable markets. This quarter's results included $0.9 million in money market funds fee waivers within our C&IS
investment management fees.
Assets under management for C&IS were $993 billion, up 10% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The
growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows, and favorable currency translation. The
sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation. Securities lending fees were $20
million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year and down 28% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was
primarily driven by lower spreads and lower volumes, while the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower
spreads. Average collateral levels declined 5% year-over-year but were up 1% sequentially.
Moving to our Wealth Management business; trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $419 million in the
third quarter and were up 1% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and
sequential performance were impacted by favorable markets, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers.
Within our Wealth Management business, fee waivers totaled $4.4 million in the quarter. Assets under
management for our Wealth Management clients were $319 billion at quarter-end, up 6% year-over-year and up
5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows, while the sequential
increase was primarily driven by favorable markets.
Moving to page 6; net interest income was $336 million in the third quarter and was down 21% from the prior
year. Earning assets averaged $129 billion in the quarter, up 23% versus the prior year. Average deposits were
$113 billion and were up 27% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.03% in the quarter and was
down 58 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short-term
interest rates, as well as mix shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was
down 11.4%. Average earning assets increased 3% on a sequential basis, while average deposits were up 2%.
The net interest margin declined 19 basis points primarily due to decline in asset yields, as securities and loans
repriced to lower interest rates.
Turning to page 7; expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and were 6% higher than both the prior year and
prior quarter. Expense during the quarter included the previously mentioned $43.4 million charge. Excluding the
charge, expenses were up 1% on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Compensation expense totaled
$462 million and was up 1% compared to one year ago and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was
driven by higher salary trends due to staff growth, base pay adjustments, and unfavorable currency translation,
partially offset by lower incentives.
On a sequential basis, higher salaries driven by unfavorable currency translation and staff growth were mostly
offset by lower incentives. Employee benefits of $97 million was up 11% from one year ago and up 8%

sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher pension expense. The sequential
increase was primarily driven by higher medical cost.
Outside services expense of $186 million was down 4% on a year-over-year basis and up 5% sequentially. The
year-over-year decline was driven by lower costs across a number of categories including technical services,
consulting, third-party advisory fees, and data processing, partially offset by higher sub-custody expense and
brokerage clearing costs. The sequential increase was due to higher technical services costs, third-party advisory
fees, consulting, and sub-custody related costs.
Equipment and software expense of $171 million was up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. The year-
over-year growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization, as well as software support costs. The
sequential increase was driven by increases in software support and equipment maintenance costs. Occupancy
expense of $52 million decreased 2% from one year ago and was down 14% sequentially. Both declines were
related to lower costs associated with executing workplace real estate strategies.
Other operating expense of $127 million was up 38% from one year ago and up 48% sequentially. Results for the
quarter included the previously mentioned $43.4 million charge. Excluding the charge, the category declined 9%
compared to one year ago and was down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by
lower expense related to business travel, partially offset by higher mutual fund co-administration fees, as well as
higher costs associated with supplemental compensation plan expense within staff-related expense. The
sequential comparison was impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust-sponsored golf
tournament, offset by lower other miscellaneous expenses within the category.
Turning to page 8; our capital ratios remained strong, with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.4% under the
standardized approach and 13.9% under the advanced approach, both unchanged from the prior quarter. Our
Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.7% under both the standardized and advanced approaches. During the third quarter,
we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share totaling $148 million to common stockholders.
And at times like these [indiscernible] (00:18:43) the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to
support our clients activities, and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution
expertise they've come to expect. Our competitive positioning in wealth management, asset management, and
asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark,
Lauren, and I will be happy to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And first from Jefferies, we have Ken Usdin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to follow up on the whole side of rates. So, good news that
NII was down better than the original guide, and I was just wondering if you can update us on what your thoughts
are as far as the outlook for NII; and at what point do you expect NII to get close to just flattening out? Is that
sometime early in 2021, or how can you help us think through that? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. First of all, I think it's important for people to realize that there are components to the securities portfolio
that are longer-dated. And there are securities we bought in 2017, 2018, 2019 that aren't going to mature for
another two, three, four, or five years. And so, it's going to take a long time to get this whole portfolio repriced.
That said, at this point, 75% of overall earning assets have been re-priced on the new yield curve. And if you were
to break it down even a little bit farther from that, you can look and see that effectively all of the floating rate
assets have been repriced; 80% of the loan book has been repriced, and about 50% of the securities book has
been repriced.
And so, I think the best way to think about it from what you can see is it, from here, about 1% to 2% of the overall
earning asset base is going to reprice every quarter. And so we've gotten through most of it. And if you think
about how aggressively we had to get through going from the first quarter, where everything was on the prior
book to then in the second quarter and now this third quarter movement, we've got the vast majority of it done;
that's why we think the flattening – we're at that point now, it's just trickles from here. But it's not going to be 100%
flat for a long time as those longer-dated securities play through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And I guess just relative to your prior comments just want to give you the opportunity just level set us on
what your expectation would be for 4Q NII versus third Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I appreciate that and I do think that – well, first of all, I'll answer the question. The way we look at it now and
it comes back to that dynamic of about 2% repricing, you could say it's going to be down 2%, give or take 1 point.
And I think that's what you should expect from the math at this point. That said, now that we're at the point where
so much of the book has been repriced, the movement in NII from here is going to be driven more by what
happens in the business and more by what happens in loans and what happens in the deposit book and how that

stays on; and, frankly, our confidence level in reinvesting that into not just cash at central banks but into higher
yielding assets. And so, from here, it's going to be much more business driven.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Glenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello, there. Thanks. So, definitely not the norm for you guys but I think everyone has a little bit higher sensitivity
to issues [indiscernible] (00:23:08) so I was going to ask just – for a little more color on the corporate action item.
Was this a manual issue? What have you done to rectify and has there been [ph] MRAs (00:23:22) outstanding
related to this? I think from the Q&A back and forth pre-call was about that, so I figured we'd just address it.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I appreciate it, Glenn. So, first of all, I just want to provide a little bit of context on this group, for people that
don't know it well and how an item like this occurs. And I think it's important to understand, with $13 trillion in
assets under custody or administration, the security services group is processing literally millions of transactions a
year. We've got errors in the group on a consistent basis and they total somewhere between $5 million, $10
million a quarter on average. That's typically what we experience there. And they're accounted for consistently in
the other operating expense line on the income statement that you see.
And so, the event itself is not unusual, it's the dollar amount. And if we focus on that a little bit; we think over the
last 10 years we've actually never had a loss cumulatively in a quarter to even get to $20 million. And if you look
back even on the years, we've never had a full year that amounts to this level of a loss.
And, interestingly, this quarter in and of itself from a volume perspective of losses, it was light. And even the other
items added up to a less than normal level. It was at the bottom end of that, kind of, $5 million to $10 million
range. And so then if you ask, what have we done; you can imagine, the first thing we do is unpack the situation.
And once we're confident that there's been a mistake, we did everything we needed to do in order to make our
clients whole. We did that. And then at that point, we looked at the processes, identify ways to improve even a
process we felt strongly about, but we identified ways to strengthen it. We put those in place, and at this point, we
move on.

From an [ph] MRA (00:25:36) perspective, you know, we wouldn't be able to talk about that at this point if it were
even – if that had even been surfaced. But obviously, we took this very seriously. I think it's important to note, this
is not out of the normal course of servicing $13 trillion in assets in terms of the event; it was really the fact that we
had a very large exposure within it that was unusual.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Cool. Maybe [indiscernible] (00:26:08) on something that relates to the balance sheet. Jason, the other
securities line is up 30% year-on-year, and it's almost the biggest part of earning assets now. The footnote talked
about community development investments, but could you just expand a little bit more on that? Because it's such
a larger part and it's growing more, what benefit do you get from that, what kind of yield pick-up, and should we
expect to see more of that? Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Just before you go on mute, I want to make sure we answer your question really specifically. So you're
talking about the increase in the securities portfolio, the kind of $56 billion, $58 billion. Is that where you're
looking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think most of that growth came on that other securities line. So, if we address – we addressed the growth in
securities year-over-year, I think that'll...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, in general, the group...

The other line in the securities line on the balance sheet. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, in general, the Treasury group is always looking for opportunities to lean out a little bit from just cash and we
feel confident. And there'll be types of investments that are short-term where it's not cash, but they're items where
we pick up a little bit of yield. And so, it could be short-term [indiscernible] (00:27:35), it could be other short-term
instruments where we pick up a little bit of cash, a little bit of yield without taking too much incremental exposure.
And so, they've been looking at that in different ways.
And part of it – I think we talked last time about the fact that part of this NII journey is going to be not just the size
of the balance sheet, but when we felt confident that we could step out of central banks. And so, as the Treasury
group's looking to do that, they're looking for not just these traditional what are we going to do with two-year,
three-year, four-year securities or mortgage-backeds, but other items that can stay short but still pick up a little bit
in yield. And so, that's not necessarily something you should see as a longer-term trend; it's something that, as
we did this initial step out, we saw opportunity.

Hey, Alex.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe just a quick clarification at NII first. So, here, you're on the kind of
1% to 2% decline in NII from here as the securities book reprice. Does that include any mitigation efforts to offset
the roll-off roll-on dynamics, or that's really kind of like a gross number, and then there are things you could do to
help mitigate the remaining pressure, albeit it's obviously somewhat small, which could get you to more of a kind
of flattish NII from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, the answer is it's very much just looking organically at the amount of this in the book. So, that doesn't
include any other strategic items. That's just the math of what's rolling off from here. That said, I do want to

caution people even though net interest income is down significantly, obviously, we're not going to be looking to
have dramatic changes in our strategy or our risk profile to think about "offsetting" the decline in rates.
And so, we're constantly thinking about optimizing the investment book, and we continue to do that; no change in
our risk appetite at all. But the 1% to 2% a quarter is very much just the math of what exists in the book right now
absent any other things that we would be – so, you shouldn't be thinking that's exactly what's going to happen
over time. There are other things we're thinking about in terms of the securities portfolio, other things we can do
with the balance sheet, but those were things we were contemplating before rates came down, frankly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's very clear. Thanks for that. My bigger picture question kind of revolves around fees. And this has
obviously been a pretty volatile year with respect to both markets and new business and volumes, et cetera.
Maybe help us level set what has been the organic fee growth in the business maybe kind of over the last 12
months, given your comments around strong pipeline and sort of building momentum in C&IS? Maybe help frame
what that kind of organic fee growth could look like over the next 12 months.
And then, specifically, I was hoping you guys could also hit on the Global Family Office business. That revenue
has been kind of flattish for the last four quarters despite a pretty significant growth in assets. I know there's a little
bit of lag there but still feels like the fees are lagging lag in the asset base. So, kind of bigger picture question, but
if you guys could hit in all that, that'd be awesome. Thanks.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, if I start on C&IS, I think the – we've separated into two different buckets there, interestingly. One is that
there has been significant growth that's come in the investment management fee line and that's come from very
good collaboration between the asset management business and C&IS, and a lot of work we did in the last couple
of years setting up the liquidity business to be able to take on assets.
So, I'm going do this at the at the corporate level, but a lot of these assets apply to C&IS. But if you go back to last
year – to the beginning of this year, the liquidity business had $215 billion in AUM; and, now, we're close to $285
billion, $290 billion. Very significant growth. Bigger than what's happened in the industry. And so, that's led to
good organic growth in the business as a result of good collaboration. Again, not 100% of those are in the C&IS
business, but the vast majority of it is.
The other aspects of C&IS as you just get to the traditional custody and other asset servicing type activities,
interestingly, the organic growth this quarter was not great. It was positive, but it wasn't great. They do feel
stronger about the pipeline that they have, [indiscernible] (00:32:35) business, and part of that is a result of the
fact that there were a lot of prospects that we won that delayed implementation, partially because of COVID, but
still very high confidence level that's going to be onboarded in fourth quarter or first quarter.
And so, we see good opportunity set to bring on that business in the next couple quarters. That said, the growth in
the money market mutual fund business, it's been it's been great, but it has flattened out at this point. And so, it's
good diversification in the business to sometimes get growth coming from the investment management side and
sometimes from the other.

Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
This is Mike. I mean, I'm going pick up for Jason while he gets the chance to get a sip of water, Alex. So, I think
importantly longer-term that, again, we continue to see the opportunity to grow at a higher organic growth rate.
Having said that, as we've always said, it's critical that that's profitable growth for us. And so, that we're doing it in
a way that is coming with operating leverage and fee operating leverage.
Now, with the change in the rate environment, that dramatically impacts your ability in the short-term to get the
operating leverage. And so, as a result, it focuses us on ensuring that, that growth does not come with the
requirement for significant resources. So, looking at the expense side of the equation and just making sure that
we keep those in line in this type of environment, and that the growth is high quality, scalable growth for us. So,
that's on the asset servicing side, and Jason mentioned asset management.
Just to close off on Wealth Management, again, as you mentioned, this has been an unusual year. And so, we've
had to shift our sales and new business strategy as a result. And I would say that I'm very optimistic on the long-
term prospects for that, but it has – in this interim period, has caused some additional volatility in the normal sales
pattern that we would have. So, long-term, very positive; but, to your point, there's some bumpiness that we've
had this year that we haven't had in previous years.

Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Alex, this is Mark, and I could comment on the GFO asset growth. I think you're seeing the growth has stepped up
in the second quarter. Can't get into a lot of specifics there, but that type of client, that type of segment for us,
those clients can move pretty large, concentrated asset holdings on to our custody platform, and that's what the
majority of the increase was in the second quarter. There's not necessarily a corresponding noticeable increase in
fees with that just because of the nature of the single holding that we might be having on our platform for those
clients.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning. I have a couple questions. On the capital ratios, I know you typically said it was a pretty nice
cushion above your regulatory minimums and above what your management buffers [indiscernible] (00:36:16).
13


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Obviously in this period with no buybacks, capital ratio's improving even further. Could you give us a sense as to
how you're thinking about utilizing that excess capital in the event that cessation on buybacks continues? Is there
anything that you might want to discuss about how you could be using that capital outside of buybacks? We've
seen some acquisitions in the space recently on the asset management side. Wanted to get your sense on that, if
there's anything to do there. That's the first part of the question. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good. All right, I'll try it and see if I got my voice back. The good news is that Mike and I talk about this a lot. So if I
don't, he's going to – we'll definitely be on the same page on it. So, I'm going to start with [indiscernible]
(00:37:06) a little bit Betsy, but I think there's four components to how – at least how we think about how we
deploy capital and how we – what capital levels we maintain. The first is, we have very good, genuine discussions
with our board about it. And that's not to say that there's any tension there; there's not at all. We're completely
aligned, but we also want to make sure that we're not being presumptuous in saying where we want capital levels
to be without having good conversations with them. So, it really does truthfully you start with that discussion.
And then, secondly, we think about capital on an absolute basis. We want to have good cushion relative to where
we need to be from a regulatory perspective. The third is, we look very closely frankly out the side view mirror and
we look at things on a relative basis. When we talk to clients and prospects, they care and we want to be able to
reflect. It's part of our overall value proposition that we've got strong capital levels, and we have to be able to
evidence that on a relative basis.
And the fourth, maybe most instructively given the fact that the stock price has come down, is thinking about
things on a returns basis. And so, we think about that deployment of capital not just, do we take capital up or
down, but what types of returns are we getting for it. And, there, we have to compare what returns are we getting
by investing in our own stock effectively. And that has to do a lot with where we think things are from a price-to-
book perspective and how it's trading and what we think. And, secondly, what opportunities do we have to
reinvest organically in the business. And then, third, we're looking at what examples there are where we can
invest non-organically outside.
And so, we've talked about the fact that we're very open and I'd say particularly in the wealth management space
where it is difficult to have organic growth, we feel very strong about the franchise and we feel like our ability to
maintain a high quality client base is very strong if we were to bring that in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, when you're talking about wealth management you're talking about teams, firms, portfolios. Is there any
nuance to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. The teams I think is harder. I think those tend to be – first of all, culturally, it's not super consistent for us to
do something like that for various reasons; and happy to talk about it a little bit more. I think, firms, where you've
got more of a sense of scale that's been there but they're maybe not at the scale that we are and we can bring
that in. And we think about our different groups almost as large teams. And we think about the offices we have,
the $320 billion in assets, you split that between the offices we have; and you have a team of $1 billion, $2 billion,
14


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
$3 billion, so, something of that size or up to $8 billion is kind of a couple of teams from our lens, but extracting a
team out of another firm is not something that we have tended to do.
And so, thinking about an organization, an established organization with a client base but with a leadership that
hasn't been able to develop a succession plan in place or they think it just might be better to go to the
infrastructure of a larger organization. You think about the scale we represent at that asset level, we can be a
good solution for firms that don't have that succession planning in place.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And what I'm hearing in your answer is wealth management over asset management. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
To the extent there are opportunities in asset management, it's a little bit more nuanced. We've done some things
there quietly, more small, that have been extremely consistent with our strategic desire to do more intermediary
distribution. And so, we look closely at those as well. I think the distinction might be probably a little bit of a higher
bar right now to do something in size at the asset servicing side of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then what if the Fed does lift the restrictions on buybacks? Maybe you could give us a sense as to how
you're thinking about how you would manage the capital in that scenario in terms of the pace that you might start
buybacks back up at, and how quickly you want to get back down to the capital ratios that you think are most
efficient for your business model?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Mike, can you answer it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, Betsy, I think Jason laid out the framework, so I won't go into that. But that is the framework that we
would apply should the Fed lift the restrictions, and we'll see. But prior to the pandemic, we were repurchasing our
shares. And so, it depends on that broader environment that we would lay over with the regulatory constraints.
So, I would hope that, to the extent that the Fed removes the restrictions, that's also an indication that the
environment is relatively favorable, which will put us back in a position similar to the beginning of the year where
we were both able to and we're repurchasing our stock.

Operator: Our next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, you guys have been focused on both investing in the
business but also doing a good job on driving efficiencies in operating leverage. The longer we're operating in this
work-from-home backdrop, I'm just curious if you found additional areas of potential efficiency, whether it's an
area of real estate or other areas that could drive that longer-term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
This environment it has been very – obviously, it's made everybody take a step back and think about that. We
have, frankly. There are things that we're accelerating the business. I mentioned super quickly in the opening
comments that we're on a real estate strategy journey right now. We look deeply at that just a couple of months
ago, kind of, in the midst of this to say how does the healthcare crisis influence that strategy.
And there are elements of it that it accelerates. And there are consolidations we were thinking about that frankly
we're saying we can do that faster. And then there are other things that we were not considering before that this
endeavor makes us consider. And I tell people kind of jokingly, a year ago I did not know how many square feet
we had off the top of my head, and now I do. And I know where they are and I know how much we're paying per
foot.
And so, we're talking about that element a lot to try and think about what does real estate look like in the future,
not just domestically but internationally. And there are a lot of creative things we can do to try and be more
efficient and try and leverage the technology that we've invested in into our partners in order to decrease reliance
on square footage, frankly.
And that also leads to areas of saying how we become more resilient and how do we think about resiliency with
our workforce overall. And we've had to make them more technologically equipped in order to be resilient. And
that adds flexibility as well obviously in very creative other ways, the way we think of our resiliency centers and
other things like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jason, you mentioned in the past that loan demand will be a key driver to NII
going forward, and we've seen fairly divergent trends across the industry. It's still fairly weak in loan demand, but
pockets of strength within the wealth area. So just wanted to get an update on your front in terms of the demand
that you're seeing across the business.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Yeah. It's interesting, you can't see it from the financial statements, but loans are actually a tick up within
September even. And that surprised us. When you go back 90 days ago, I think everyone felt like we were going
to see balance sheets come down, we thought liquidity – we thought cash was going to come down, deposits are
going to come down, we thought loans were going to come down. But our balance sheet on average was up in
the quarter and even there, it's not just the clients are holding more deposits but loans were held in.
And so, it does seem like some of the loan demand we have is coming from clients that are saying they want to
be ready to do things, to be more active if they see opportunities come up. It's unclear whether or not that will
actually happen, whether or not the opportunity come or whether or not they'll actually pull the trigger on it; but
that's certainly been the case that they've held in in terms of loan volume.
And we've been talking recently about the fact that liquidity in general is a big component of what we do with our
clients. And so, if you think about liquidity more broadly, as clients wanting to find safe, high quality places to park
their cash and short-term assets, they view our balance sheet as strong and we've talked about the fact that our
money market mutual funds, very strong investment performance, they're at size; our Treasury funds are $80
billion to $90 billion, and so various appealing places even for very large institutional investors to invest. And then
on the other side, clients know, as they've worked with us, we understand their asset composition well. And so,
we can be a thoughtful lender in terms of how to structure things in the most efficient way for them.

Hi. Good morning. A couple [indiscernible] (00:48:00) questions to get us out of the way. Just, if you could
comment on the typical seasonality that we see – uptick in expenses that we typically see in the fourth quarter in
conjunction with the golf open which added some expense in 3Q? And also, the exit rates for money market fee
waivers in September just to get a sense of sort of where we're running into for 4Q on that?

Sure. Mike, you want to do – so, the first was on the seasonality in the in the Northern Trust?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, just in general on expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Oh, in expenses [indiscernible] (00:48:43)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Fourth quarter expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, there are components of expenses in fourth quarter that are – that we should actually carve out because I
think third quarter in some ways is not an ideal run rate for some of them. And so, maybe we'd just walk through it
a little bit. First of all, take benefits for example. There, you see the trend that took place but the part of it is the
fact that medical has gone – and it's not an enormous line, but it's had enormous jump from second quarter.
And so, medical in second quarter was something like $17.5 million, it went up to $26 million in third quarter.
That's closer to a typical run rate but could still see some tweak up from there. And so I think that's just something
to keep in mind that, as our partners exited effectively doing normal things in their own healthcare maintenance,
that's coming back online. And it's had a surprisingly large level of volatility from my perspective frankly.
And then outside services is another one where we believe we'd see a similar step up in fourth quarter to what we
saw in third quarter. There's a lot of business volume related costs within that category that are likely to increase,
and we're still running at relatively low levels of costs when you think about things like consulting, legal, technical
services to dial down and we're doing everything we can to tamp those down but that could come back up.
And then equipment and software, on a year-to-date equipment software costs are up 11%. That's likely close to
where we're going to land for the full year 2020. The category where the expenses are expected to have higher
levels of growth this year is to the fact we've invested in the business, we've got higher depreciation and
amortization costs; we've called that out. D&A is something like two-thirds of that line in general. And so that's
kind of in the soup. It's hard to tamp that down as aggressively.
18


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
And then I'll talk about occupancy, mentioned it a little bit. There's going to be volatility there. We're going to make
some investments, frankly, in occupancy to try and get our longer-term run rate down a little bit. And so, you're
going to see that line item bounce around a little bit. And so, in general, I'd say it's less about seasonality of run
rate in expenses, and it's more about two things. One is how do we get back to undoing the COVID-related
influences on expenses; and second, what are the investments we're going to make to try and decrease our run
rate in the long run.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:51:44) on the money market fee waiver trajectory at the end of 3Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'll do a couple comments there. One, is as we – you can pick it up from the opening
comments, we're right at $5 million only in the third quarter. Now, the reality is there's – the $300 billion in money
market mutual fund assets we have, that is relatively stable at this point but rates are moving around a lot. So,
you've got to assume that rates and volume stay the same. But third quarter was $5 million. As we sit today the
run rate on a quarterly basis is about $11.5 million as we sit today. The team thinks we could have waivers in the
fourth quarter, $20 million to $25 million. And exiting the year, so as a launch point into 2021, could be $25 million
to $35 million.
And just to give you a sense of what does that mean. I think it's super important to remember that the fact that if
you go back to the beginning of this year when we're $215 billion in assets, the overall revenue run rate was much
lower than what it is right now. And so, now you go up to $290 billion and the run rate is over $400 million in
revenue. And so, we're talking about the fact that we have a decent amount of waivers but from a much higher
revenue base. And so, the story there is kind of mixed in some ways.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's super helpful. And then, Mike, maybe on just ESG. You mentioned at the outset, the ESG analytic service
that you have sort of – maybe if you could just talk about where you are in the growth path of that, and are you
rolling it out to all of your asset servicing clients, and how's the take-up? And then also on the Wealth
Management side, are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients for investing in ESG product that you
have, and sort of the organic growth outlook in the investment management side for your ESG products?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Right. So, Brian, the reason why I did mentioned it upfront is because ESG does run across that company and
each of our businesses. And you started to highlight it there, but let me go back through a little bit. First of all, just
from an investing perspective, to your point, we are seeing more and more demand from our clients, both
institutional, but to your point, on the wealth side, including our GFO clients in ESG investment product and
investment strategies.
So, as a result, we've as you would expect with our business model, we've looked to fulfill those demands with
ESG product from our asset management group. And as I mentioned, over $100 billion at this point. But I would
say still in the early days of that trend and of the growth opportunity for us there.
19


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
And then more broadly, in thinking about our institutional clients, particularly asset owner clients, they're being
held to a higher standard as well as to how they're investing from an ESG perspective; and as a result, they need
the analytics around that. So, I talked about the capabilities that we rolled out and, to your point, I would say early
days on that because I think this is a very long-term trend.

Hi, Mike. Hi, Jason and Mark. I just want to follow up on the operating error. I know you've had those for years
and I recognize it's one item, but large amounts do get a lot of attention. You I'm sure are aware of what's
happened to another – to a G-SIB when the amount much larger [indiscernible] (00:56:18) they do have those
kinds of errors. And I know you've been – what do you plan to do to automate more of these processes so that
you have less of these errors? I heard you talk about trying to do stuff that you need less reconciliation, less
checking. So, Mike, what do you need to do to step up to limit these and hope that something like this doesn't
[indiscernible] (00:56:43) larger amount in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Vivek. So, Jason mentioned, this is the nature of our businesses, and that part of the business is processing
transactions for our clients, broadly speaking. And there are certain aspects of that, that have been automated
and were automated years ago. And that's – what you would expect is find the areas that lend themselves to
automation. You get the benefit of both efficiency, but also dramatic reduction in risk from incurring errors. And so,
that's a longer-term path that we've been on, and I'd say the industry as well, for some time period.
And then you have other aspects of what we do that don't lend themselves as much to automation because of the
idiosyncratic nature of the particular transactions. So, in this case, corporate actions where certain aspects of
corporate actions are very straightforward. And so, they've already been automated or portions of them have
been automated, but other parts where it's still difficult because of the lack of homogeneity of the transactions
themselves.
With that said, we have – this area, even though it's primarily manual with some level of automation, it's an area
that gets a lot of attention from a procedures and control perspective. And, frankly, as much as there have been
20


Northern Trust Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
errors in the past, it's been very well controlled. So, think about it as higher inherent risk as we see it, but with
procedures and controls that we've been able to manage and mitigate the risk that comes with that.
That's not to say that we haven't been on a path of trying to add in additional workflow tools and automate
additional things that we can. We've been investing, broadly speaking, in our securities services area significantly
for years to modernize the technology in that area. So, it's on a path. And then, you have a situation like this that
occurs that certainly brings more attention to it, but it wasn't attention that we felt as though, boy, we've ignored
this area; rather, we've controlled it and we've tried to improve it, but it requires additional procedures and controls
and, as we go forward, more modernization and automation as well.

And that line – I should also add even though you didn't ask that is the area that we saw the EAFE local is down
on a year-on-year basis. So, that was actually a drag for that line, markets were, because that line as we've talked
about before is probably 2:1 more based on EAFE local than I would say what domestic indices are doing.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Yeah. I did notice that you mentioned that markets were down and I was wondering which one. So,
I'm glad you clarify that point. And are you highlighting that because the fee rate is higher on that market, because
I didn't think EAFE was over 50% of your revenues.

No. Just to try and give you a sense of the importance – so you try and predict asset levels, trying to just
appreciate the influence of EAFE local within the C&IS trust fee base as opposed to wealth that's much more
exclusively driven by just domestic indices.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Brennan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just actually sort of following up on that line of questioning
from Vivek. When we look at the trends in AUC/A growth in C&IS versus revenue, it looks like at least the way all
of us, knuckleheads from the outside model you, there was some fee rate pressure. I know that it doesn't always
translate that way to how you run the business and how you strike the deals and the contracts and the way all the
pricing works. But could you maybe provide some color in helping us understand what might have caused some
of those dynamics? Are those sustainable? What was behind that? Just to help us inform as we sit there and think
about our modeling and where to go from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Understood. I think more and more frankly, there's going to be less connectivity between the asset level
and revenue levels. And a lot of the negotiations that take place, we're thinking about trying to include a more
holistic approach to the relationship which might be what we're doing with the firm with investment management,
what we're doing with integrated trading solutions, what we might be doing from [indiscernible] (01:02:52)
perspective, how we're handling cash and sweep. And so, I know it's super frustrating to not be able to just use
that row on a model to predict the revenue, but more and more the reality is just it's disconnected in terms of the
way the business actually prices these relationships.
Mark spend a lot of time thinking about this, too. Mark, add your thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Right. I mean part of it I would also say is fee structure. And as we've talked about before, 35% to 40% of those
assets servicing fees in C&IS are not directly linked to assets. So, in a environment where assets are rising, that
factor alone would probably put the fees at a lower growth rate. And then, more importantly, and it gets a little bit
to what Jason was saying as mix of business, and even within the actual asset servicing fee category, a very
22


Northern Trust Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
large domestic US custody mandate, large assets maybe not a large fee, a fund administration mandate could
come with much less assets and the fees are significantly higher. So, there is a mix that's at play, too, besides the
timing which we've talked about before and the period versus earning over a quarter. But hopefully that helps. It's
a tough one to unpack, we understand, to the point that Jason mentioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So just – that's all fair and I totally appreciate that. But to the point of – can you give some color to the point
of the third quarter as a jumping off point then? Like, were trends that you saw in the quarter then reasonably
sustainable? Was there some sort of noise that might have caused that divergence to look a little wider? Just to
help us kind of – any help you can give on that front as we think about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Well, a couple of thoughts. One is that in the spirit of – the business does have some compression. Just to
get to your specific point earlier as you asked the question, I want to make sure we come back to and address it
specifically. And those decompressions are going to be honored whether or not we're in a COVID environment or
not. I actually think though that doesn't have as much of an influence on the dynamic that you're realizing which is
that there seems to be – that there's a disconnect between the growth in asset levels and the growth of trust fees.
And in the short run, you can have flows into and out of the business that are going to be reported on – the assets
you're going to be reported on where they are at the end of the period, and the revenue is going to be reported
based on where they were a prior period, a book period before that, maybe average. And so, it's very misleading
to try and do the math on short-term to try and get a sense of what the fee realization rates look like on the
business on an incremental basis. And even the business that's being added if it's being – if it's a very large
pieces of business, they could be at extremely low fee rates; but if it's more a middle market activity it, could much
higher. So, the business mix itself will have an influence there, but much less on the ultimate profitability.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for your patients with that one. My second question is around just trying to get the processing error
again. And I think, Mike, you might have made some comment about this, but I just wanted to kind of explore it. I
think you said that you all are continuing to review those processes, see opportunities for automation control and
process review which of course is ongoing but maybe an event or loss like this might sharpen pencils, so to
speak.
Will this have some kind of impact do you think on investment in the near-term or some of the expense lines as
you guys look to maybe shift [ph] or investments in (01:07:18) automation, hire some additional staff for that effort,
or what have you; or is it more operational focus rather than the potential for investment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Brennan, I would say it's sum of both. So, certainly, there are the operational aspects which I talked about.
And just to be clear, we've done the full scrub on this incident already and have changed the procedures already
and changed the controls already in that area. And from a resource perspective, it was not a question of
insufficient resources in the area that resulted in the error. All the same, we're trying to ensure that, that isn't the
23

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
case at any point going forward as well, so whatever resources – but that's not something that would result in a
change in our financials, if you will, or expense run rate.
And then on investments to your point there, the incident in and of itself doesn't change our investment plan but
the broader environment, without a doubt, you're always – we are always impacted by the situation that we're in
and, as a result, prioritizing our investments. So, the opportunities we have to invest far outstretch what we would
deploy in a given year. And as a result, you have to determine, okay, how do you prioritize those. And do you
focus on productivity, investment for productivity, investments for risk management, investments for innovation
and growth.
And so, that's a process we go through every year and ongoing. And I would say in the environment that we're in
now, we have to ensure that, yes, we have the operational resiliency and levels of automation to ensure that
going forward. And then second, I would say productivity. We have to make sure that we're investing the
technology dollars in a way to get the productivity improvements we think we need in this environment to be able
to drive scalable growth.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
declines. And it seems like that helped you, I guess, outperform on NII a little bit. So just, is there anything
unusual in the non-interest-bearing side? Is that something you're trying to grow, or is that just the episodic puts
and takes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I mean, maybe I'd put it a little bit in between. I mean first of all, I actually – I think it's good for people to realize
the reason we did better than we anticipated with NII. Frankly a little bit less around the size of deposits, that
certainly played a factor, but I come back to the fact that we were able to turn on noncash and loans held in
better.
But then to your specific question about the growth in that category, hard for us to comment on what the industry
is experiencing but we've – back to the theme that we talk about liquidity a lot with our clients and they view – they
tend to comment to us that they view our balance sheet is very strong. We try to position it that way. And so, we're
happy to be a liquidity partner for our clients there, and I do think that has an influence on where they tend to park
their short-term asset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. That's fair. And maybe for Mike, you mentioned upfront that you're trying to do more with current clients.
Any examples that you can give us in terms of what you see as the biggest opportunity set to do more with your
current clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, first of all, I'd say within the businesses, there's definitely the opportunity and one we're pursuing to do more
particularly I would say with asset managers. So, just thinking about our approach to the market from a whole
office perspective. It's not just back office or middle office, but also what we can do on the front office. So, I
mentioned, for example, integrated trading solutions or essentially outsourced trading for those institutions. That's
doing more with those clients.
So, it's using really our position of strength which is in the back and the middle office to be able to do more in the
front office for them. So, that's on that side. And I could use – I'll say other examples within the businesses. But
also I want to add though and highlight, it's also across the businesses. And so, it's a concerted effort to say if we
have, let's say, an administration client, fund administration client, are we providing wealth management to the
executives of that firm; or if we have a corporate client where we are the assets servicer for their pension plans,
can we provide a wealth management solution or program, what we would call firm-to-firm, for their executive
group.
So, it's those types of cross business opportunities that historically we've done very well with these, but I would
say it's more because of the culture and the way that we operate. And we're trying to be more purposeful and
disciplined about how we do that.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, I wanted to start off with a question on just some of the NII comments. And, specifically, I
was hoping you can help us think about the incremental capacity that you have currently to remix some of those
excess reserves into securities. And just as we think about modeling the securities yield, [ph] where are you
(01:14:17) reinvesting today versus the 130 basis points on the back book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
The capacity is a trickier one because it depends on how quickly the deposits come in. And sometimes we have
to let deposits season in order to get proper treatment for those to and get the confidence level they're going to be
able – that they're going to stick around so that we know we can take more duration risk with those. And so, the
reality is the size of the deposit base doesn't necessarily correlate exactly to what we can think about in terms of
noncash reinvestment opportunity.
In terms of the opportunities on where we are investing at the time, there is more of a distinction there, frankly.
We did step away from just central bank deposits once we start to feel that the balance sheet was more stable.
And, frankly, I think this is something people have missed; part of the reason that I think all banks were – even
going to the point of why did – why were share repurchases suspended. Banks wanted to be there for their clients
in case there was significant loan demand and in case there was very significant demand to place deposits
[indiscernible] (01:15:48) you want to make sure that regulatory ratios were going to be adequate.
And given the fact that we've got such a large custody base, we wanted to make sure that if those assets started
to come toward the balance sheet, we were going to feel good about it. And so, we were patient on that. But the
more we realized that there was stability from a client perspective, the other components of the regulatory
environment were there and more stable, we could take a step away. And what we did in third quarter was really
incremental in size and in asset class.
But if you think about eventually the things – we can start to move more toward longer dated securities, we can
start to move more towards CLOs, more toward MBS. Now, unfortunately, in a typical environment you might see
more of a 50-, 70-basis-point differential between the non-HQLA portfolio and the HQLA portfolio, that's
compressed. And it's more like a 30-basis-point differential at this point, and there are other things that we can do
and explore based on what the opportunity set is, given the risk and return framework and the different securities
that we feel comfortable in. But that should at least give you a little bit of a framework on how we think about it
and a little bit of the dynamics from a quantitative perspective as well.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful color. And then just thinking about the expense outlook. Looking out to 2021, I just
wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the expense growth trajectory. NII is expected to
decline about low double-digits assuming, versus the current run rate, things are relatively stable. The fee income
growth potentially growing mid-single digits at least on an organic basis. I'm just wondering, is there room to do
better on cost where expense growth actually lags in the organic fee growth to help dampen some of those
pressures, or how you're thinking about it in terms of the general internal philosophy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, we still consider ourselves a growth firm, and we're investing for growth. And things even like the growth in
the money market mutual funds, it takes investment upfront to get the cut-off times right and to get investments
done with portals. It takes also expense growth on an incremental basis. When you think about the administration
fees that we pay to run some of the processing side.
And so, I think that's a good example of just thinking we think about things more from an operating leverage
perspective. And to the extent that we have good operating leverage in the business, then we're going to feel
okay about the expense growth. Otherwise, we have to be extraordinarily disciplined about it. And so, let me just
break it down, there's three different levels of how – to your question, how do we think about it, three different
levels: one is just total operating leverage; two, trust fee operating leverage; and, three, organic trust fee
operating leverage.
Now, on the first, this total operating leverage, that's including a very declining component of revenue, which is
NII. And, so it's going to be very difficult. And I don't think it's a very pure test right now given the unpredictability
and the disconnect of that line item from the rest of the business. So, think about that as the one we want you to
focus on. The other end of the spectrum is organic trust fee leverage. Unfortunately there, that's not a GAAP
number. And so, we can give you some components of how we think about it, but we can't really ask you to track
that and just trust us that it's going to what we're expecting.
And so, let's focus in the middle, on trust fee leverage. And, there, I think that's probably the best, from what you
can see and from what we think about, that's probably the way to focus our discussion and track how we're doing.
But those three elements, and certainly trust fee operating leverage are a very big one for us to – as we think
about the expense trajectory next year, it's incredibly front of mind for us. Again, we went through the entire re-
plan. We did the re-plan on expenses, we did it on capital, we did it on strategy.
And so, as we go into 2021, the trust fee leverage is going to be a key item to make sure we're doing and
exhibiting the discipline we should given the net interest income environment that we're in. We're giving up $300
million. If you extrapolate what we've done so far this year and put that kind of on a run rate, you're talking with
hundreds of millions of dollars that we've given up in NII. And we're not going to ignore that. We're going to be –
we got to be disciplined and have a high sense of urgency about doing what we can to get the expenses as lean
as possible given the environment we're in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
One is just how we should be thinking about the jumping off point for other income given there is a lot of noise in
the quarter as we just look out in 4Q and heading into 2021. And then just on the fee waivers, just to clarify
quickly. $5 million was the impact this quarter but it still sounds like your expectation is somewhere in the range of
$25 million to $35 million per quarter headwind exiting this year. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes. That's right. Yeah. Again this is – and I thought about mentioning it earlier but I want to make sure we're
giving you guys everything we can. If you think about hopefully call it $300 billion base of business, and say $200
billion of it is somewhere in flow for waivers. And the different funds jump into waiver mode at different levels. But
if you look at where the overnight repo, for example, is right now and if you look at it NIF Treasury – if you look at
the Treasury products and those are the biggest products we have. And this is – you've got to imagine that over
50% of the assets are 30 days or less. And so, at $90 billion roughly, you're talking about $9 million per basis
point.
And so, I cringe giving you guys numbers that have such volatility in them, but just think about how much of a
dynamic that is. If that strategy comes down literally a single basis point, it influences run rate by almost $10
million a year. And so the numbers you quoted are right, but I think it's important for everybody to track the
overnight repo market, track 30-day Treasuries, track 6-month, track 12-months to get a better sense intra-quarter
of what that number might be looking like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
On the operating income – this is Mark – it certainly has volatility, so I can appreciate the difficulty modeling it. If
you look at averages over the last year-and-a-half or so, you're probably looking at something in the mid to upper
[ph] 40 (01:23:41) range. This quarter, we did have some benefit from the supplemental compensation plans that
sit within that line that we're a little bit outsized versus what they've normally been. So, you're probably a little high
this quarter and if you looked at the average, like I said, mid to upper 40s.

Operator: Moving on, we have Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. So, it looks like you have best in class fee growth led by best in class wealth and asset management growth,
but I still need help on the disconnect between the growth in assets under custody which were up twice the pace
[ph] of peer (01:24:35) year-over-year up 16% and the custody fee line which was up only half as much. And then
you said timing is part of it, but if you look at the last 12 months, your assets under custody is up twice as much
and your related fees [indiscernible] (01:24:52).
So, it just seems like outside AUC growth relative to the fees. And I know you said some – AUC is not tied to fees,
that's fine; but it still doesn't seem to explain everything that's going on there. So, either there's something else in
there or you're [indiscernible] (01:25:14) based on price or I'm just missing something. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, let me address the – that business – vast, vast majority of AUC in wealth is GFO. And the reason for that is
that's where the outsized portion of clients that might not manage here but that want to use us as a custodian. It's
kind of a hybrid business between the Wealth business and the Institutional business. And so, when you look at
the AUC number there, vast, vast majority GFO. That client base is very, very – it's very, very spiky. And so, you
get very high number of – you get a small number of clients that can literally have billions or tens of billions of
dollars of assets coming in from an AUC perspective, and that's not going to influence how we think about the
pricing on the overall relationship. We think about the relationship very holistically. And if a client has a – it could
be mega, mega liquidity events from a small number of clients, they'll move that line item – that AUC number –
dramatically without influencing fees.

...single stock exposure that they're dealing with. They'll ask us to custody those assets for a period of time until
they decide where to put those funds to work. And our goal is to work – first of all, be that provider so that we can
be a best in class custodian for them, and then introduce the other advisors, managers, to do what we can to also
be a manager and a financial advisor.
We might do manager selection for them. We might become an OCIO provider. They might put some of those
assets into – they might move those assets from where they are into our liquidity funds. They might ask us to do
tax advantaged equity investing where we're very tax conscious. They might do a more aggressive ESG mandate.
But the custody-ing in that business, especially if it's a mandate of that size, is going to obviously significantly
change the denominator. But in the short run, it's not going to change the numerator which is the fees we're
getting off of those assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just one follow-up. So, the gist behind the question was pricing competition in the servicing business.
Is it getting worse, better? How do you think about competing? I mean, sometimes it might make sense to take
lower prices because of the scalability.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. In general, the conversations have been or hopefully starting to be more about what is your capability set,
what does resiliency look like, how did you handle the crisis, what are you able to do to help us from either
investment operations outsourcing. Mike hinted earlier at integrated trading solutions. And so, all those things in
the long run should be helpful in moving away – just like the asset management business, moving away from just
talking about investment performance here, moving away from just talking about pricing to more value added. In
the short run, there were concessions that we've agreed to as we do every year, and those played through early
in the year. And so – but in the longer run, we're hoping that these conversation is more about capabilities and
about service quality are going to reduce those – the frequency and severity of pricing discussions. But we're
always going to have...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sorry. Sorry, the word concessions kind of stick out in my mind. Is there a magnitude of the concessions, and do
they come back or they just – how does that work?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
So, I don't – the word concession maybe is a little different. But repricing, that's just the kind of thing that we've
seen pretty consistently. And I don't know [indiscernible] (01:30:14) talking about that picking up or accelerating.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And, Mike, I would just add. So, where you have large relationships that are good, but those client relationships
have grown, meaning the assets have grown just like we talked about when their fees are tied to a bip on those
assets that were either custody and administrating, whatever it may be, they tend to then go up over time. And
then the client looks at it and says, hey, you know what, I'd like to take a look at the pricing on this because your
fees have gone up because their assets have gone up. And yet from a work perspective, you may be doing more
but not as much as our asset growth.
And so, that's the exercise. If you're not able to come to an agreement, then a client can say, we're going to take it
out for a rebid. And then that process then as a result, they're likely to get more aggressive pricing on it. Now,
again, we try to minimize when it has to go through that whole process, but I think that's the nature for very large
institutions like that.
I would also say on new business, just to be clear, price is a factor of course and we lose business on pricing at
times. So, it's not as though we price to win; we price to win at a profitable margin for us, and have models to be
able to determine what are the resources required and therefore where can we price it. And if we can't get there
with either where we think it is or you just find out through a process you lost, and the reason why you lost is your
pricing was not aggressive enough relative to who they ultimately picked.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, everyone. I got a big picture question [indiscernible] (01:32:18). Your balance sheet and your
deposits, in fact, Jason you mentioned that I think earlier questions. Everyone [indiscernible] (01:32:30) What do
you think normal [indiscernible] (01:32:40) the size of your cost base. You mentioned [indiscernible] (01:32:45)
have much more liquidity today because [indiscernible] (01:32:47) we all know that. [indiscernible] (01:32:53).
What do you think your normal size should be? And do you have any – or maybe [indiscernible] (01:33:02)
actually get there, is it 2022, 2023? Any thought there?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Gerard, it's Mike. Why don't I just first just clarify your question is around, as you've started it, bigger picture
question. But with all these factors going on, what is your expectation for a normal – the normal size, I'll call it for
the balance sheet? Is that what you're getting at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. [indiscernible] (01:33:28)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Okay. Okay. Let me make one comment. And then since you led in with big picture, that allows me to answer it
without all the details that Jason can provide. But I would say as much as you might say, boy, there's been a lot of
monetary policy across the globe and that has elevated the size of your balance sheet. And so, would you expect
that to kind of come out of the system and see your balance sheet go back down. So do you have "excess
deposits" right now?
My perspective on it is we're into a very long-term period for this type of monetary policy. And so, I don't know
how to define normal but as far as the liquidity that our clients have right now and what they're doing with it, be it
on our balance sheet, in the funds, I think there's going to be a lot of liquidity in the marketplace for some time
period. Now, it ebbs and flows, as far as our client and our balance sheet and funds. But just in general, I think the
water level is higher and I think it'll remain higher for some time period.
Jason, I don't know if you want to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
The only thing, just to maybe bookend, is that if you go back a year ago, deposits were kind of mid $80 billion.
And if you think about [indiscernible] (01:34:58) deposits are today in the one-teens. And so, I would use those as
the bookends. But I think Mike's comments reflect it's probably near the higher end of that bookend.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just to come back to the processing error. You've been very good at explaining what
happened. You mentioned that processing errors occur all the time and [indiscernible] (01:35:26) every year, of
course. Was the actual – whatever the execution was, was it upsized execution related to your normal processing
services caused an outsize cost? And then second, [indiscernible] (01:35:50)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, Gerard, again, just because your line is cutting in and out a little bit, but I think have the question. The
first one, you're trying to get your arms around the size of the loss. And the two things I would say. One is that, it
was a large corporate action. So, size-wise, in the marketplace, it was a large corporate action, and our clients
were active in that particular corporate action. So, that was one aspect of the size. It was large for the market. It
wasn't necessarily any larger for us vis-à-vis anybody else; it just happened to be a large corporate action.

And then, second, as far as a timing perspective, the error just to be clear was identified within minutes of having
been made. And so, it's not – and then, it was ultimately remediated as soon as we could practically do it. So, we
did not carry a risk position, I'll call it, for an extended time period that just got worse because we thought markets
were going to change or anything like that. It was obviously an unfortunate situation. We're very disappointed
about it, but we looked to mitigate the potential costs as soon as practical, and we were able to do that.

Operator: And moving on, we have Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning, guys. Mike, you started to touch on it a little bit in the last third of the call here. In the past, you've
emphasized scalability [indiscernible] (01:37:34) remarks today you emphasized tech solutions. So, I was hoping
you could give us an update on the progress you've made here on these priorities and where you think are the
best opportunities to increase scalability in up your tech solutions going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, I think that, Rob, the expectation would be that I would say it's all in our asset servicing business and the
processes and operations around that, which is certainly from a dollar perspective, that's the largest opportunity.
And it's one, as you mentioned, we've been pursuing that. And the point here is we'll only continue to do it. And if
you did say, within 2020 and everything that's happened, has that affected the pace? I would say, it has. And
some of it is, I would say, the fortunate circumstances of seeing the model operate differently and seeing new
opportunities for scalability within the business model.
So, more remote work is definitely a part of that and, frankly, managing the processes is different in a remote
environment than it is in a facilities in-person based model. And so, we've had to adapt and, as we've
acknowledged, there have been changes and risks that come with that; but also I'm saying there's also some
opportunity where we see to get more scalability.
But then the other aspect of my response was going to be that in areas where it's already relatively scalable, so
for example in wealth management, as that business becomes more digital, that becomes even more scalable as
well. The point being that – and again, we've seen an acceleration of that in this environment as well because as
much as we will always offer the highest level of service for our clients, and that's our market positioning, that's a
differentiator for it. The nature of that has changed over time and has only accelerated.
Be more specific, clients need to and want to be able to do more things on their own through mobile or other
digital devices and that's great. So, instead of necessarily calling someone here to get something done, they can
just go to their phone and get it done. Well, that changes the scalability of that activity because they can – we can

have as much volume of that as you can imagine, but it doesn't increase the resources or certainly at the same
rate. So, we see it, as I say, kind of across the company, and it's just a matter of continuing to execute.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's great. Thanks, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thanks, guys. Yeah, I just have one quick question at this point. When you think about the pipeline, and I
know it's a mix of different clients that are in there and different services that you're onboarding, but when you
think about the onboarding process underneath this operating leverage as you have to work with today, how
much longer is the onboarding process as we think about how to lag these revenues in, in this current
environment versus what it would've been previously? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, as Jason mentioned, we did have a, call it, deferral in the transitions particularly in the second quarter,
and then we pick back up – transitions pick back up in the third quarter particularly towards the end of the quarter.
And, yet, he's also said we have a high level of business that has been won that needs to be transitioned. And
you've identified one of the aspects of how that has changed the cadence or sequencing of those transitions
because some of them are much easier to do in a virtual environment.
So, if you think about, I'll call it custody type mandates, there's a lot of activity that's required but that happens or
can happen – a lot of – it was already, I would call it, very digital or it could be done virtually. Whereas if you think
about broader IOO, investment office outsourcing mandates, those are more difficult to do. They involve more
people. And so, when those people are remote, whether they're the clients or ours or there's some requirement
for us to be hiring people to be able to take on that business, that does take longer to implement and to get
transition. And then there's all types of mandates, I would say, that are in between there.
And we're moving on them. So, you heard some of the fund administration wins that we've had in the
[indiscernible] (01:42:43) space which has been great, but it does take a little bit longer given the nature of that
activity that you're taking on.
Operator, any other questions?
