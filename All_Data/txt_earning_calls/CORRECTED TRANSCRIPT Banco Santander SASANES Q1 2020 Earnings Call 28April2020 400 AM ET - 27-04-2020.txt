Thank you, Sergio. Good morning to everyone. I hope you find well in the middle of this health crisis, you and
your families and relatives. Well, this quarter has been a strange quarter. We've been in a business-as-usual till
the last two weeks. The last two weeks, the COVID-19 outbreak has produced an unprecedented worldwide
health crisis. This is a health crisis that – which is resulting in an economic crisis where the financial system, I

think, is more resilient and banks need to be an important part of the solution of the COVID-19 economic
situation.
Since the crisis started and with some anticipation, we implemented in our geographies specific measures to take
care of our employees, customers, shareholders and investors in order to protect them and to mitigate the
economic and social impact. I will talk more about this is in the last part of my speech.
Starting with the quarter, let me to follow how the quarter has – the figures have behaved. In volumes, we grew
significantly, more at the end of the quarter than the beginning. The loan book grew €26 billion. The pickup was
basically in the latest part of March due to the drawdown of the committed lines by the large corporations.
Deposits grew 6% with a jump also in the second part of the month of March.
Our customer digital activity reached record figures, that is not strange, and the growth in the group digital
customer base doubled that compared with the previous quarters.
As regard results, we recorded a provisional overlay of €1.6 billion to cover the expected deterioration of the
macroeconomic conditions arising from the health crisis. As a result, attributable profit was only €331 million.
Excluding this charge, underlying attributable profit amounted €1.977 billion, 1% higher than the same period in
2019, 8% excluding the exchange rate impact.
In the current environment, our credit quality and liquidity remained solid in all geographic areas you have in the
numbers. We continue to generate capital organically, although the quarter had – the growth in risk-weighted
assets has been approximately 3 times the ordinary growth. The consumption of capital due to growth
[indiscernible] (00:03:47) 21 basis points in the quarter that were offset by the non-dividend payment and the
result – as a result, the core equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.58%.
Going to the geographic areas, the resilience of the underlying performance and results is based in our
diversification and scale. By region, we can see growth in loyal customers; increase in loans and customer funds,
notably in the Americas. In Europe, profit and profitability were dampened by the already complex economic
environment before the crisis due to low interest rates that become low in some geographies, particularly in UK,
and then furthermore by confinement measures in many European countries in March. North and South America,
on the other hand, record strong profit growth and improved profitability.
Going to the global business, performance has been stellar. We grew both in CIB and Wealth Management at
21% underlying profit in the quarter. CIB grew strongly, particularly in the last few month [ph] as well in (00:04:57)
the funding needs of our customers. These were reflected in a greater utilization of existing credit lines in March
alone, more than €15 billion, and increase in deposits. Wealth Management & Insurance recorded also very high
profits due to strong activity levels early this year, which has slowed down at the end of the quarter due to the
impact of the crisis in the market.
Going to the P&L. Well, first thing to say, exchange rates play a significant role, has a negative impact of 5
percentage points year-on-year. If we take a look in – our cost in euros would reflect the underlying operating
trends we see. Customer revenue growing at 3% with cost management and growth in provisions partly driven by
higher volumes, not just for the economic crisis that we expect from the health crisis.
As a result, underlying attributable profit amounted, as I said before, €1.977 billion, 8% higher excluding the
exchange rate impact compare with the first quarter 2019. The non-recurring charge of €1.6 billion correspond to

the already mentioned in provision overlay and the remaining amount of restructuring cost that you have for –
more detail in the appendix.
With regard to the provisions and – so now acknowledged by the IASB and other regulators and supervisors, it is
likely to be difficult at this time to know the specific effect of the health crisis and government and central bank
support measures. Nevertheless, in the first quarter, based on the information on the environment at the quarter-
end and following the regulatory guidelines, based on the expected deterioration of the macroeconomic
conditions, a provision overlay will be recorded conceptually, reflecting the permanent impacts from the COVID-
19 in the medium long-term arising from the expected worsening of the portfolio's credit quality and avoiding the
negative effects from profitability and volatility of the IFRS 9 in the very short run.
In this environment of extremely high uncertainty, the macro variables considered here are very much in line with
those published by IMF. It is not exactly the IMF on a country-by-country basis, but we had scenarios on a
country-by-country where the main items that affect the potential provisioning level going forward are GDP
growth, unemployment and house prices. In our case, also the car sales. So, it's important how deep the
recession is, but it's probably more important in accounting for how long the recession or the recovery or when the
recovery comes.
Going to the revenue, in the first quarter, customer revenue grew 3% boosted by the Americas, as I said before,
and our global business. Net interest income grew due greater volumes combined with active management of
deposit costs in an environment of falling interest rates.
In net fee income where our global business – Wealth Management, plus 6%; CIB, plus 20% – would account for
more than 44% of the group total fees generated. We are confident that we will continue to deliver quality,
revenue, growth. I will further discuss this at the end of the presentation in the conclusions.
On costs, costs 3% lower in real terms in Europe, as we were indicating to you in our efficiency plan, costs
dropped significantly in all countries, notably in Spain, minus 8%; UK, minus 6%. This performance is – comes
from the efficiency plans we are executing in all this geography. These enable us to obtain the expected
synergies in the quarter to deliver our target for the year. Good management in North America where costs have
not material change. In South America, of particular note, was Brazil with a 2% fall in real terms.
This performance allow us to remain leader in efficiency among our peers with a efficiency ratio of 47%. Our goal
is to continue to making progress regarding operational environment and cost management adapted to the new
environment. We continue to pursue our targets as we indicated to you in our investor update.
Credit quality, while the quarter was in line with the traditional trends, [ph] typically (00:09:43) the NPLs, coverage
ratio and cost of credit remained basically stable with the same trends you've seen before.
On capital, well, we continue to strengthen our capital ratios in the quarter. We once again generated capital
organically combined with the favorable impact from the dividend measures taken resulted in an increase of 36-
basis point in the quarter. The increase took place in a context marked by strong growth in risk-weighted assets,
21 basis points in the quarter, three times the ordinary increase, mainly due to the higher lending and some
market volatility that affected the risk-weighting of the market positions.
On the other hand, we had significant non-recurring negative impacts. As you can see in the slide, 19 basis point
for corporate transactions that were already announced – Allianz, Elavon and the minorities of Crédito
Consignado and Olé Consignado in Brazil. 15 basis points from regulatory impact [ph] and model (00:10:50) that

we were expecting – is the majority of what we are expecting for this year. And 9 basis points from markets
basically, the mark-to-market of the ALCO portfolios in Mexico and Brazil.
We are comfortable with our capital levels. We maintain our 11% to 12% capital target in the scenario we foresee
in the coming quarters, with the aim of being on the upper side of the range.
Finally, and before handing to José to comment the performance of our main markets, I would like to highlight the
resilience of our profitability ratios, both in terms of underlying return on tangible equity and return on risk-
weighted assets, as well as the TNAV per share we remain about €4 per share, although, suffer some impact
from FX – from the exchange rates.
I hand over to José to elaborate about the different units and regions.

José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio. Good morning, everyone. As for the performance by region and country, the Americas
increased their weight as a percentage of total profits to almost 60%. So, we remained very well diversified. As
previously mentioned by José Antonio, North America and South America grew at double-digit rates, where the
performance in Europe was impacted by the economic environment. Also, our global businesses increased at
double-digit rates, which helped to strengthen our local franchises.
Taking a look at volumes, we also had a positive performance in the quarter and covered our customers' funding
needs. Loans grew 7% in real terms excluding exchange rate year-on-year, mostly driven by South and North
America, which grew at double-digit rates across all markets. In Europe, 4% growth with increases in all countries
except Spain as I will explain later.
Customer funds were also up in nine markets; deposits 6%, while mutual funds fell 2% mainly driven by the drop
in equity and fixed income markets. In Spain, we had positive commercial trends, especially in March when loans
increased by nearly €3 billion, driven by SMEs and corporates. This trend accelerated in April as the ICO lines
became available.
March was also a month of intense digital activity. We operated most of the month with 50% of our branches open
and recorded the highest month in the number of digital customers, almost 5 million digital customers interacted
with the bank. The number of new contracts signed with digital signatures tripled, accounting for more than 50%
of the bank total sales.
We had slightly lower net income, although profit before tax was up as cost savings offset the drop in total
revenue. Net interest income was down 8% due to smaller ALCO portfolios and lower average earning assets in
wholesale banking. We are in line with our cost savings plan, as José Antonio said, delivering 8% drop in costs.
Non-performing loans fell 41 basis points year-on-year and provisions remained also under control.
In Santander Consumer Finance, the business was the first to be impacted by the health crisis first in China,
where, as you know, we have an operation and later in our units in Italy and Spain. New cash sales in Europe
dropped 26% in the first quarter, while new lending in Santander Consumer Finance fell only 5% due to the strong
performance in January and February.
In the last few weeks of the quarter and driven by the confinement measures, the declines were sharper. New
lending in Italy and Spain was at 10% to 20% of the usual volumes, so that drop of 80% to 90%. In Germany, the
5

levels were 50% to 70% of normal levels. And only the Nordic countries remained are pre-crisis levels. These
declines were reflected in our results, especially net fee income which fell 12%.
On the other hand and due to the good performance at the beginning of the quarter, net interest income increased
5%.
Costs rose due to the new alliances that we signed in the quarter and in the previous 12 months. Excluding the
change in perimeter, they fell 3%. Provisions were higher mainly driven by lower portfolio sales compared to the
first quarter of last year. The underlying profit, as you can see here in the upper right of the slide, it fell 5%.
Moving to the United Kingdom, volumes grew at good rates. Loans increased 5% year-on-year in the quarter and,
driven by mortgages, loans grew 2%. However in April, new mortgage applications fell 80%, while the demand for
mortgage repayment holidays amounted to around 50% of the total mortgage portfolio.
Revenue was affected by lower yields on new production and the continued as SVR attrition. Also, fee income
was lower in part due to the reduction in overdrafts. However, we had a good performance in the P&L. Costs were
reduced by 5%. Provisions fell 20% and cost of risk remained at very low levels.
In Brazil, we kept our good momentum going, which continued to show recurring profit generation even in the
more adverse current circumstances, current environment. In volumes, lending increased 18% year-on-year with
all segments growing, notably corporate and CIB. Consumer funds rose, boosted by demand and time deposits,
up 31% and 17% year-on-year, respectively, both partly favored by foreign currency balances – the depreciation
of the real.
The return on tangible equity rose to 22% following the 10% increase in profits as you can see in the P&L. Net
interest income increased driven by higher volumes which offset margin pressures due to the mix effect, the
negative impact from the fall in the Selic rate in the interest rates and the limit on the overdraft interest rates.
Net fee income grew driven by payments, COMEX and forex. Strong efficiency improvement year-on-year and the
cost of credit remained stable. In the quarter, profit rose 8% due to the strong fall in cost and provisions,
seasonally higher in the fourth quarter, which obviously favors the quarter-on-quarter comparison, and which
more than offset the fall in net interest income due to lower spreads and net fee income.
To finish, in Brazil, let me give you some color of the activity in recent weeks. The acquiring business is down
15% relative to pre-crisis levels, cash withdrawals down 30% and auto loans down 40% to 50%. In the United
States, we had a strong volume growth in the quarter, driven by both corporates and auto, which do not yet reflect
the falling activity recorded in recent weeks. Underlying attributable profit rose 46% year-on-year, with an adjusted
return on tangible equity of 12%, backed by higher revenue and cost control. As you can see on the page, profit
rose strongly quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonally lower provisions and costs in the first quarter.
In Mexico, loans and customer funds grew at double digit rates, new lending to corporates and CIB more than
doubled in March compared to a regular month. They went back to usual levels in the first weeks of April. Profits
rose 22% year-on-year, backed by positive performance of income and lower non-controlling interest. Costs were
higher due to increased amortization and technology investments. However, efficiency improved by more than 1
percentage point. We also had good asset quality with all metrics improving. Compared to the fourth quarter of
2019, underlying attributable profit fell due to high gains on financial transactions in the previous quarter.

And to finish, I will make some quick comments on the Corporate Centre, where underlying attributable loss
decreased 16% compared to 2019 mainly due to the combination of two things. On the one hand, in total income,
positive impact of around €93 million in gains on financial transactions, mostly coming from foreign exchange,
foreign currency hedging, and two, costs which improved 13% year-on-year reflecting the positive impact from
streamlining and simplification of our process carried out in previous quarters.
With these I'll turn it back to José Antonio for the third section of the presentation. Thank you.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. I'm going to elaborate basically on the actions we're taking as a result of the COVID-19 crisis,
and I'm going to provide you the latest data available, to give you the facts how the business is performing. The
data I'm providing to you in this section till the 22nd of April.
So starting with the – how do we manage the crisis. Well, this crisis has produced an unprecedented situation. So
the end of the first quarter was very, very conditioned by the spread of the virus, we had to manage the business
in a total different way. We've been monitoring since the beginning of the situation and activated all the necessary
protocols to ensure business continuity. We implement different measures, taken into consideration also the
authorities' recommendations, well, the central banks have been acting and we take these measures in order to
protect our stakeholders and to fulfill their expectations in our actions.
As the pandemic has evolved within each market, the group has evaluated the situation and roll out measures in
line with the specific needs of each country. I would like to explain more detail how do we manage the crisis. In
crisis situation, preserving our critical functions is key in order to provide service of high standards to our
customers. Different action plans were implemented in different corporate areas and the counterparties in all the
countries. These actions, plans covered the four dimensions included in the slide. As prevention, we follow large
scale strategy to work from home. Currently, more than 110,000 people is working from home. This was
combined with keeping 70% of our branches open and their employees working shifts. Our ATMs are fully
functioning and most of our employees in contact centers are also telecommuting.
We've been proactive regarding internal and external communication to be as transparent as possible. Our aim is
to keep our people, customers, shareholders, and investors informed at all the times and providing advice if
needed. And we are monitoring risk and liquidity day to day. While measures we took also measure for the
community in which we are working. One of our main priorities is to contribute to the well-being of the society as a
whole. We have implemented actions, more reliable resources together with governments and institutions to help
the society. We already raised €100 million to combat the pandemic. Some of the main initiatives are the creation
of solidarity fund which already amounts €54 million financed by reduction in remuneration and voluntary
contribution from the bank employees.
We've been pretty active in Spain, one of the most affected countries in this pandemic. The bank has donated
several millions of protection masks, respirators, hospital beds, and blankets and other things that were in high
demand in these days. In Santander University, we reallocated €30 million to fight COVID-19 and by this local
units supporting vulnerable groups with €16 million. We are working with third parties to facilitate donations and to
help where this is needed and is required from us.
Let me do – to talk a little bit one area of the bank that has become crucial in this situation and this is the T&O,
has been key through this process allowing us to continue to running the bank and serve our customers remotely.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
We increased as you may expect our network capacity, our bandwidth and increased the maximum number of
users supported by the VPNs. You have the figures in the slide.
In Q1, naturally as a – natural reaction of the containment, we had dramatic increase in the operation through
digital channels. We doubled the number of the increase in the digital customer base, the digital sales increased
significantly, record quarter in number of assets, the behavior of the group was more accentuated in some
countries particularly Spain, Poland, and UK.
Let me go to the figures. Already José mentioned some of the figures in relation with the activity. Well, we have
also adopted measures to facilitate well our customer life during the crisis in all regions. We provide payment
holidays or deferral in most markets. You have in the slide some figures, temporary option to increase credit card
and overdraft limits, proactive support for vulnerable customers, being proactive on trying to cover their needs,
reduction, and suspension of some fees.
With regards to the payment holidays, we have received applications and requests both relating to the
government programs, as well as the Santander options. On the slide, you can see the number of applications for
the largest customers and how they are well above 1 million. Also you can see the weight sort of percentage of
the total portfolio at as of 22 of April. This process is still underway as you can imagine. And we think that we
could end up affecting 15% to 20% of the mortgage book in Europe, 5% to 10% of the consumer book in Europe
and 20%, 25% of the consumer book in the US.
Another feature of this crisis is the governments in different countries have been particularly active in establishing
programs for SMEs and corporates whose aim is to provide liquidity and credit facilities with favorable conditions
for business facing hardship. You have in the screen some of the programs established by the different
governments in Europe and the US and South America. Perhaps well I'm giving you the figures on the right side
that related to Spain. Spain has approved two tranches of €20 billion each. We were assigned with some of these
guarantees lines. We already approved 60,000 operations, €9.6 billion of which €7.2 billion are guarantee by the
government. The figure is spread across different segments, where we reach all the sectors from large corporates
to self-employed.
We provide €7 billion for the smaller sized companies across 59,000 operations. Additionally we have granted –
we continue with the ordinary activity since the mid-March, the ordinary activity has been progressing well
according with our expectations.
In these context, if we look at the loan book in different segments, what you see is kind of a stable, slightly up
individual-related business being mortgages and consumer is too early. So at the end of the March, I will provide
you figures for the applications in April and SMEs and corporates, you see in March, a significant increase in the
size of the loan books due to high demand and dropdowns particularly on the CIB space, where the book grew in
the month of March €19 billion.
So if you go to the trends, José mentioned some of them. You have here in this slide, the new mortgage lending,
how it's evolving. When we refer to new mortgage lending, it's payments, actual payments that goes into the
stock. We were – daily average the different regions, well fell 60% in mortgages. While the applications and you
have on the right side, this goes from minus 80% Spain and UK, to a smaller impact still in Latin American
business.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
In Consumer Lending, you have the same figures there, minus 25% in new consumer lending, and applications
falling differently depending on the countries and regions and businesses. This is the – well, it's a summary of the
behavior of the individuals vis-a-vis in the middle of this crisis.
When it goes to the corporates and CIB, we have a total different picture. We see the opposite new SMEs and
corporates lending grew already in March and much more in April due to the use of the government programs,
daily average went from €500 million to €600 million in February, that is probably the normal level to close to €700
million in March, and more than €1.1 billion daily average in April.
In CIB, [ph] happened the same (00:29:56) was the massive drawdowns of existing credit facilities in March, while
in April the balance sheet is fairly stable. I hope this gives you a sense of what's going on in the business in these
days.
Just to finish and to allow you to have time to ask questions you may have, let me to share with you a couple of
points. We think the best way to support our shareholders is to prioritize the health and safety of our employees,
and our top priority as a way to help customers and communities and ensure profitability for the shareholders.
This is the best way to act in this scenario. We are confident going forward because we have a strong starting
point, both in terms of balance sheet, liquidity, capital and in terms of P&L, our pre-provision profit is one of the
strongest in the industry.
Finally, our business model is very resilient and you have seen year after year in the stress test that we tend to be
less affected because of the resilience of the balance sheet. And we are activating management actions in
revenues and costs that could mitigate the negative impacts that will be derived from the COVID-19.
Firstly, we reiterate our €1.2 billion cost reduction commitment. We'll take additional action in costs, including
detailed analysis of our process in the new operating environment. From the revenue side, we are managing cost
of funds to reflect the new interest rate environment. The cost of deposits has been reduced over the past few
quarters. We still have some levers to continue this trend going forward. And also on case by case, we will try to
design an efficient pricing strategy on the asset side to reflect the deterioration in risk profile. However, it's too
early to be conclusive about the macro and financial effect of the current health crisis.
As stated during the latest AGM, the medium-term strategic objective will be reviewed once the economic impact
of the crisis is clear. In the meantime, considering the high level of uncertainty and lack of visibility, the situation
recommend to be prudent, and at this stage we are not in a position to provide a guidance with the levels of
certainty required.
To conclude, I would like to reassert that the pillars of the group strategy remain unchanged, improving operating
performance, optimizing capital allocations to the regions and business that generate the related highest returns
and accelerate the group transformation, the group digital transformation.
That's all on our side and we will be ready to answer the questions that you might have. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first
question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thank you very much for the very comprehensive view of the current situation. I have a few follow-
ups; hopefully, very short. Can you give us the breakdown of the €1.6 billion provision overlay? I can't reconcile
with the divisions. And the two follow-ups to that is, if I take the €3.9 billion total provisions you've taken in the
quarter, should we annualize that? I heard you, José Antonio, say that it's very uncertain and you're taking IMF,
but at what circumstances should we annualize it or should we not annualize, could it be worse, maybe some
color there?
And the last point or related is one of your competitors or peers, yesterday, in their results were saying that their
provisions were consistent with saying that 50% of the payment holidays would ultimately result in being a default.
Can you give us a color? I know that provisions don't strictly work like that, but can you give us a color of what do
you think the payment holidays today, ultimately, how much of that could result in defaults based on your
modeling? What do you think about the quality of those payment holidays? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, a couple of different questions, Alvaro, to answer at this point, at this juncture. The breakdown of the
overlay, we don't have a specific breakdown, we went by segments, using a global scenario that is not exactly,
but is close to IMF scenario, and we don't have any specific – at this stage, a specific breakdown that I can
provide to you on a country by country basis as I understood you were asking.
We made €3.9 billion provisions in the quarter. Should this number – can this number be annualized in this terms,
well, I will say, generally speaking, my thinking of this, and don't take it as written in the stone, we are managing
the scenarios, we tend to look backward and to try to assess what has happened in different countries in the
scenarios like this.
We have the real estate crisis in Spain; we have the recession in Brazil in the other side. If you look backwards in
the real estate crisis in Spain, the group as a whole we were running in the 1.4%, 1.5% cost of risk at this time.
You look backward in Brazil when the recession hit the country and the GDP fell by 10%, the cost of risk went
around the current – a little bit lower than 400 to 500 basis points. So those are the kind of figures that we have in
our mind.
And while payment holidays, you mentioned how much of this is going to be default. Well, you need to look at the
book. So 40% of our total book as a group are mortgages. So, we do not expect a significant default in the
payment holidays related with mortgages. The payment holidays, the majority of the payment holidays related
with mortgage have a financial advantage to the customer and make sense from the financial point of view of the
customer to take these payment holidays, and we think that many of them are taking because – some of them
because they are facing a difficult situation, some others because it's an advantage.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Having said that, the main factors behind potential default here when I mentioned before GDP, unemployment,
house prices, the house prices, how did they develop not in 2020, is more 2021 and 2022 is the most important
factor in relation with potential default in mortgages. So, I do not expect – in mortgages, the majority of payment
holidays are mortgages, I do not expecting a bad outcome there.
In consumer, we need to elaborate on country by country basis. You've seen that – and José provide information
and in the latest figures I provide to you in consumer in Europe we have like four countries that the production
collapsed, and the other four countries half of the business still performing relatively well, Germany, Nordics and
countries around these. So we do expect different outcomes according with this kind of situation.
So, particularly in the US, [indiscernible] (00:38:30) extensions that we provide you the number of extensions is
business as usual. The number of extensions we do in a normal month without having a crisis is in the region of
15,000 a month. Yeah? So now grew dramatically, but this part of the business as usual and is difficult for us to
assess how much is going to end up in higher cost of risk.

Operator: And comes from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the previous questions. So, you mentioned that the scenarios that you are
managing are in line with the past crisis in Spain you mentioned or the recession in Brazil. So, this time, the
economic recession is going to be bigger overall, not only in those countries but worldwide. So what makes you
confident that the cost of risk should not be bigger than what we do have been mentioning for those scenarios in
past crisis? So that's a general question.
And then specifically wanted to ask you about Brazil. You mentioned that the cost of risk in the past recession
2015/2016, went up from 4% to 5%, so at that time, you went through the recession in Brazil in a fairly good
shape. How do you expect now the Brazilian bank to perform in this crisis given that you have grown relatively
fast and how confident are you of the risk taken in the last few years? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Paco. The first question why this time is not going to be bigger? As you know, provision is related with
expected losses in a medium and long-term period. What matters here is we have a new kind of crisis this time.
It's a crisis that we've never seen, for that reason is extremely uncertain the outcome. But if you look at the
different scenarios not necessarily on the IMF, well, overall all the scenarios have a strong impact in 2020 and
relatively rapid recovery in 2021 and 2022.
So if that's the case, the level of default is not that high. So remember the last crisis when I spoke before in Brazil,
the GDP fell 10% and the recovery is still ongoing, okay. So, three years later still not recovering this. In Spain,
the top to the bottom was around 10%, 9%, I think it took four, five years to recover. The kind of crisis we have in
front of us is a crisis we do have a deep recession with very sharp duration, sharp meaning months or maybe
three months, maybe six months, maybe nine months depending on the kind of scenario you want to – the kind of
11


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
V or the kind of U scenario you want to choose, but in any case relatively sharp period of deep recession that
follows a relatively rapid recovery immediately after.
This is not a very bad scenario, if this happens for the cost of risk. The longer the recession lasts without even if
the intensity is lower, the higher penalization I mentioned already in mortgages in which is not that – what matters
is not that much how deep the house prices fall immediately it's how long it takes to recover the prices afterwards,
yeah.
So, this is the general thinking on this. And for that reason, we remain relatively confident that if – and it's a big if
at this stage, the scenarios behave like the ones we're seeing from the different economies, and we have a
relatively quick and rapid recovery afterward, the scenario is workable, I will say.
You said Brazil, well, in the last crisis we had – you said, yes, that we had a different portfolio that we grew a lot in
the last couple of years, it's true. Well, our franchise now is much better franchise than it was four or five years
ago, much more resilient with much higher profitability, with much more capacity to take management action.
I'm fairly positive on the trends in Brazil, not really because of this is going to go up, sure. We're suffering right
now and you see in the NII, the impact of the overdraft charges that were reduced significantly, yes. But the
underlying trends are pretty good, yeah. So we continue to see our strength across the board is significant, and
we are I think we are well prepared to face the headwinds that we're going to suffer in the coming quarters, and
we feel confident that we're going to be able to match, in the range, I was telling you. Well, not exactly, don't take
the numbers, take the range as a potential outcome in the coming quarters.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale
Hello. Thank you very much for the presentation. Carlos Cobo from Société Générale. The first question would be
on the FX hedging policy if you could update how much of the currencies you've hedged and for how long that
hedge is in place. So if we're fully seeing the impact already in Q1 and what will be the phasing of that hedging
rolling off?
And secondly, if you could confirm that the €1 billion cost cutting target for Europe is being reiterated I think José
Antonio said. And whether you see any risk [indiscernible] (00:45:14) coming from investment related needs in the
context of the COVID-19, I would like to understand your thoughts around, any room to beat the previous
guidance on cost now, or on the contrary to meet the targets, do you now need to make an stronger effort?
And finally on capital, if we should still maintain the 12% yearend 2020 target or how should we expect the capital
evolving from here? Thank you.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Well, I will take the second and the third question. I will pass to José the first one, the FX hedging policy. Target
for €1 billion cost cutting in Europe remains in place as reiterated. I'm fairly optimistic. You see the numbers in the
first quarter, fairly optimistic we are getting there. Probably in the short run, we're going to have, as I mentioned
before at the end of the presentation, we're going to take management actions, management actions on revenues
and costs, and costs, we have capacity to reduce the costs further from our targets in this environment, yeah.
Capital [indiscernible] (00:46:28) 2020 capital, as said that we also expect to remain inside the range of our target.
Remember, our target in capital is 11% to 12%, and we'll expect to be in the upper side of the range at the end of
2020, taking into account all of that has been said in this presentation.
José, FX hedging?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So in terms of hedging, we have two different policies for capital – for the capital ratio, we fully hedged the capital
ratio, and we do that on a monthly basis. So any exchange rate volatility does not affect the capital ratio directly.
And in terms of profits, we hedge basically based on our expectations for exchange rate movements.
And to go into the details this year, we have the Mexican peso, the sterling and the US dollar fully hedged and we
have the real partially hedged. So in the next few quarters, if the exchange rates remain where they are today we
will still see some negative impacts on our numbers.

Jose Abad Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Hello. Good morning. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have three questions. First one is whether your
€1.6 billion post-regulatory impairment taken today, does this include the positive impact from the guarantees in
the different countries that you operate?
The second question is on the profitability. One of your European peers actually mentioned in a conference call
which was taking place in parallel to yours that they expect to take zero profit from the government guarantee
lines, is this also the case for you in Spain or in other countries?
And the last question is given that actually only in Spain two tranches have been approved, up to actually €40
billion so you've granted a €9.6 billion, so based on these, should you expect actually this to go up to potentially
€45 billion in cumulative incremental corporate lending until potentially Q3? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. When you are referring to the €1.6 billion including guarantees, these include guarantees, do not include
guarantees is because we are assessing the portfolio that was in our books as of 31st of March. So and this new
lending started in April. So does not include government guarantees. How much profits we expect to reap,
13


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
understand the profit in the overall and in related with government guarantees, I don't expect to make profits out
of this. So, we're going to get some revenues, some cost of risks, but overall is going to be difficult to make
profits. We may make some profits but not significant at all.
The government guarantees, you extrapolate the – as you know in Spain, the government established a kind of
coupon for each bank based on the market share in the overall credit market. And our case was I think 18.5% or
something like that. And as you know we finished the assignment of the lines that were granted to us one week
ago and we still have pending demand. That's something that you may expect given the fact that although our
participation in the overall credit portfolio, the market share is 18.5%. Our participation in the SMEs corporate
space that is the ones who are demanding more loans in these days is in the region of 25%. For that reason we
have a significant demand. Well, it's up to the government to go from the €40 billion to €100 billion. They manage
this and what I can tell to you is we have still demand pending for this kind of facilities.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yes, hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. When I look at your stage 2 and stage 3 exposure, they fell quarter on
quarter, although very marginally. But how much or what movement should we have expected in your stage 2 and
stage 3 exposure, if the EBA didn't have the new rules out on forbearance? Would that have had any impact on
your stage 2 and stage 3 exposures?
And then, my second question would be, clearly, COVID-19 has different impacts in different countries, but
overall, which countries are you most concerned about in terms of the outlook and which countries are you the
least concerned about?
And then my final question would be, if you could just remind us of your rate sensitivity, given that we are seeing
lower rates both in Brazil, Mexico, the US and so on? So if you could remind us of your rate sensitivity? Thank
you.

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So the interest rate sensitivity to a drop of 100 basis points is around €500 million, [ph] €176 million
(00:53:08) more or less in Spain. Very, very small sensitivity in Latin America, but overall for the group, it's around
€500 million more or less.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So there are two questions, Stage 2 or Stage 3, it's too early to go into this detailed analysis in the next. We have
plenty of moving parts. The first one is the scenario that very likely we're going to have more in the Stage 2 and
Stage 3. Second, we have the government guarantees that are going to offset partially what goes to the Stage 2
and Stage 3. So the uncertainty is so high that at this stage, I can elaborate very little on this.
The overall – which countries will be more affected. More than – this country side will tell you ex-government
guarantees, the segments that I see potential higher effect. The first one is all the SMEs, self-employed, small
corporate segments, on top of the traditional sectors that everybody has in mind. Yeah, you know the sectors.
Everybody speaks about the sectors, yeah. But by segments, this is the segment that probably is going to be
significantly affected.
The second one is some pieces of the consumer lending, not necessarily cars, probably direct lending much more
than car – the auto lending is the second I see a potential more impact. And at this stage, and I may be wrong
because this depends on how price evolve, I don't see a significant impact in the mortgage books, because the
interest rates are so low that affordability ratios and the loan-to-value ratios in our books are relatively low.
Interest rate is very low, so affordability ratios are relatively high at this point. You combine the affordability ratios
with the loan-to-value ratios, I do not expect a big impact overall in the mortgage book.

Hi there. This is [ph] Adrian T (00:55:25) from Credit Suisse. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Three
follow-up questions from me. On the €1.6 billion provision overlay, can maybe provide us some key sensitivities
around your base case scenario? You mentioned GDP, unemployment and house prices is the key variable. Just
to judge if these are getting better or worse, what we could expect?
On the capital, can you maybe help us think through the potential impact you expect from the risk migration, given
the increasing PDs and LGDs? And then the third one, just a clarification, thanks for the disclosure on the
mortgage and consumer payment holidays on slide 30, can I just clarify that you're still accruing net interest
income on all the loans in all geographies on these? Thank you.

Well, the €1.6 billion, the question was exactly....
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
The sensitivity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
The sensitivity to the base case. Well, this €1.6 billion comes from the combination of two scenarios. One in
scenario that is kind of [ph] B (00:56:29) scenario that is relatively mild and one scenario that we call internally
[ph] U (00:56:36) scenario that is much, much worse and overall much – it takes longer to recover some of the
variables that are behind these expected losses, particularly, as I mentioned before, house prices.
So, if house prices, let's say, fall 20% and it takes more than three years to recover. The impact is much more
intense than if we have a stronger GDP fall in the short run and a recovery immediately after than otherwise will
be the case. So these are the – the base case we are using is a combination of [ph] B (00:57:16) scenario with
[ph] U (00:57:17) scenario that give us, and I mentioned before, kind of IMF.
On a country-by-country basis, in some countries, it's more intense than IMF. In some other, this is less. But
overall, as an average, we are basically there.
Capital impact of the rate immigration, remember, we have – 50% of the portfolio is standard model. The other
40% is mortgages that rate immigration is not significant and this rate immigration affect barely to 10%, 15% of
the portfolio. That is related more with the kind of CIB business and some corporate. So, the impact should be
relatively minor. Yeah? So we're going to have some but relatively minor in our case given the fact that the
standard model still plays a big role in our capital numbers that we've been telling you.
And the third one is consumer – the third one was?

Holidays. Payment holidays, if we accrue, if we don't accrue. We accrue in the majority of the case, although
there are some cases that the government initiatives – the payment holidays force us not to accrue for one month,
two month or three month. It's not significant, but it has some effect, some in a limited number of cases because it
doesn't apply to the overall portfolio; that's applied to specific people that has a very, very low income and with
vulnerabilities that we cannot accrue interest, but this is really, really minor.
What this has in the other cases is the financial effect because we are translating interest into the future principal
payments and that has some financial advantage for the borrowers. Yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marta Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much. I've got three questions. The first one on capital. You've mentioned you aim to be at the
upper end of your 11% to 12% target for fully loaded core equity Tier 1. However, given that 2020 is kind of a lost
year, dividends are more or less banned and you still have legacies from the previous crisis, would it makes
sense to clean up as much as possible in 2020? I.e., would you be willing to bring your fully loaded core equity
Tier 1 just in line with the MDA thresholds of around 9% after [ph] CIB 5% (01:00:09)?
The second question is on your ALCO strategy. How attractive do you think current sovereign yields in Spain,
Italy and Portugal are? Are you willing to increase your exposure to the periphery? Do you believe the ECB
backstop will be effective and hence it makes sense to load up on periphery bonds today?
And finally on Santander Consumer Finance, thank you very much for the call color you provided on recent
activity levels. How that translates into revenue outlook for the rest of the year? And just to be – on cost of risk,
you've given us lots of details and you've tried your best, of course, given the uncertainty. But where do you see
the costs of risk in Santander Consumer Europe progressing for the next three years? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, hello, Marta, it's José. I'll take the first question. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about
legacy issues from the previous crisis in terms of capital beyond the IFRS 9 transition period. So, we can take that
offline and discuss that, but I don't think we have any legacies whatsoever coming from the previous crisis in
terms of capital.
Having said that, you have to remember that we no longer have a capital conversation buffer in the UK, which
gives us 20 basis points. So the capital requirement has been lowered by at least 20 basis points. We have fully
reached the AT1 and Tier 2 buckets. So any new issuance of AT1 we do will go against P2R. So, if we issue in
the market this year, we will create more space on a higher MDA and we would expect to demonstrate that our
capital continues to be extremely resilient even in the worst-case scenarios.
In the different stress tests that have been conducted by the EBA and the ECB, we've always come as the least-
affected bank. Those were paper crises. This is a real crisis. But what we are saying is that our capital, which I
would agree that it takes time for us to build up capital because of our model, our model also – it's extremely
resilient when withstanding the shocks of crisis. And we will demonstrate our capital will withstand this crisis again
extremely well.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The second question was related with ALCO strategy. Yes, why not. If we plan to buy Spanish, Italian
sovereign bonds in order to hedge the current accounts. Well, this ALCO meets monthly. But I can tell you, we
are probably at the lowest level in the last six, seven years in the portfolio of ALCO in – you are referring to the
parent company. We had the lowest level in the last probably six, seven, eight years, I don't know, for a long time.
Finally, revenue outlook for Consumer Finance. This is going to have an – immediately affecting the fee income.
You saw at the end of the first quarter, we mentioned because fee income in the new origination plays a
significant role there. Fee income coming from the launch and fee income coming from insurance business that
we do have the origination. This is going to be the main effect in the very short run.
You mentioned the cost of risk, I already elaborate that we do expect much – a significant higher impact. We are
relatively positive in auto lending and we expect higher impact in direct lending. And direct lending, well, the
biggest portfolio is Germany and somehow Spain, but it's smaller size, Nordic countries and naturally those are
the portfolios.
The business is two-thirds auto lending, one-third other business, credit cards and direct lending. And this one-
third is where I do expect higher cost of risk and the portfolio by countries is – well, Germany is the largest;
second is Spain. Italy, we have some lending, although it's guaranteed by the payroll since the probability of
default is relatively low on Nordic countries where we have credit cards and direct lending, where I do not expect
a significant increase.
Going forward, you mentioned in the medium term, well, in our scenario in the medium term, the cost of risk will
go up, but not in a dramatic way.

evolving in the coming quarters, I think that the 1Q has been a bit of a trough of the year and it's quite uncertain,
but if you can give us some color on how do you see the capital moving onwards.
The second one is on the government reactions in Latin America has been a bit lower than what we have seen in

In the first quarter, we had, as you could see, 15 basis points from regulatory and accounting charges and 19
basis points from perimeter changes. We wouldn't expect to see significant perimeter changes in the coming
quarters and there may be some regulatory charges, but they are not going to be of the nature and the amount
that we saw in the first quarter.
So, going forward, I would expect or we would expect the capital to evolve in line with our capital generation,
which we think could still be in the region of 10 basis points per quarter on average.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Government reactions, your question was if the reaction of Brazil and Mexico was lower. Well, this is
probably the European view. You take into account how these societies – where is the – in economic terms –
where these societies in economic terms are with the informal economy playing a very big role and the resilience
of the population in terms of – the resilience to a confinement of these populations is much, much lower than it is
in Europe. You will understand a bit better why in some countries, they've been reluctant to take strong measures
of confinement.
Having said that, they are taking measures and if this is going to affect our – the performance because this slower
reaction of the governments, well, it will depend basically the kind of actions they will take in protecting or
guaranteeing the lending to the SMEs.
Having said that, you take the figures. The figures are pretty small. When I look at the SME booking in Mexico
that, in our case, is more than 50% already has guarantee from the government from a institution called Nafinsa,
more than 50% of the book we already bought guarantee for this book at the origination time when the book was
originated. And you see Brazil, the size of this book relatively small.
So, the governments are reacting. In Brazil, there is plenty of measures that the government and the central bank
already took, and we feel comfortable there. And – well, in relation with how they are handling the health crisis, I
am not an expert on this, there is plenty of controversy about how to manage this. Even in the Europe and the
States, there has been controversy about this. I'm not in a good position to make you a – an analysis of this.
Yeah.

Fernando Gil de Santivañes d´Ornellas Q
Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation. Just a follow-up question on the ALCO portfolio. Just to get to
the strategy on the ALCO portfolio, I see that the volume has come down quite significantly in the quarter. What
you will expect in terms of sales and the disposal on the TLTRO programs on the ECB? This is one.
And the other one is on RWA inflation, I mean, you have disclosed on these pages, 30, 31 and 32, the increase in
loans in April so far. How does this effect on the RWA makes an inflation going into quarter two? Thank you very
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So the ALCO portfolio sales, well, this depends on the decisions related with [ph] interest rate (01:09:13). With
regard to the size of the portfolio, well, it's up to the ALCO to decide if we want to increase or not, and I cannot
elaborate on this.
On TLTRO, well, the role of TLTRO depends very much on the overall liquidity in the market. At this stage, the
overall liquidity is quite good. Our liquidity position, in fact, our LCR since we started the crisis had been going up.
The deposits are growing fairly rapidly, stable deposits coming from customers. And the liquidity position is, as I
said, is improving almost on a daily basis.
Risk-weighted assets inflation, because the lending I show you there – the lending goes to corporates and CIBs,
the lending go into SMEs, the majority of this has kind of government warranties so the weighting is very, very
low. Risk maybe in the region of 5% to 10%, 15% depending on the country but this is very low. So I don't see
that much inflation there.
The other growth that we had was in CIB. That was already in the first quarter. We do not expect another jump in
the second quarter in CIB, companies drawing the committed line. So, we expect a more normalized behavior.
So, overall, with the individuals, I don't see in this quarter coming back to normalized levels in Europe. And with
the majority of the lending go into SMEs being warranted by the government and with CIB being incredibly stable,
I don't see a particular inflation in risk-weighted assets or some come from ratings. Some of your colleagues have
said before, it's not that important. Here, the government guarantees plays a role. Unfortunately, origination with
individuals is fairly low. So, overall, I do not see and we will stick targets as José said before. So...
