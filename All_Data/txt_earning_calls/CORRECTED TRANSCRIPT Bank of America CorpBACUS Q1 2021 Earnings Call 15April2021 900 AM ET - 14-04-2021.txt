risk and uncertainties, particularly during the pandemic period we have been operating in. Factors that may cause
those to be different are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are on our website. Information
about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings
materials that are available on the website.
So with that, I will turn it over to you, Brian. Take it away.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us. It's been a year since we first reported our results which would
include the health crisis impact. But what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the
economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time. The most recent economic indicators
reflect that an economic recovery that is gaining momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary
policies. From our company's perspective, we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than
what we were when we entered the health care crisis. Compared to last year, Bank of America's balance sheet
has higher capital ratios, higher reserves, but lower charge-offs and record liquidity.
Our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way
through the crisis. Our Global Markets and Global Wealth Management businesses, which would typically benefit
from this healthy capital markets environment, continued to perform well this quarter. Our Consumer and Global
Banking businesses also performed well, but this is after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by
the interest rate environment and credit cards. These businesses now are in full recovery mode and are out
generating new assets and new relationship with our clients.
All this work by my team, in which we're very proud of here, has led to EPS in the first quarter of $0.86 per share
and a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Paul is going to take you through the details in a moment, but
simply put, we believe our decade plus long dedication to responsible growth has put us in a position to both earn
more money and deliver more back to you, our shareholders. Our announcement this morning regarding share
repurchases highlights our intention to increase those repurchases over the coming quarters as the current
restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve.
But first, let's discuss the recovering economy. On slides 3, 4 and 5 – we shared slides like this with you the last
few quarters. They are updated with the most quarterly data. They highlight the key economic signposts. I won't
go through all the details on them, but they are there for your reference. But a few highlights. Obviously, GDP
consensus projections continue to improve, and you can see our tremendous best-in-class Bank of America
research team's projections in the upper left hand corner of slide 3.
You will note also the increases in the consumer spending from our Bank of America customers at the bottom of
the slide, which is not only much higher than the prior year when payments began declining, but notably is much
higher this year-to-date than year-to-date 2019, a more appropriate comparison. This is a key element of the
economic optimism you're seeing reflected in the market. Looking back to 2017, after tax reform and other
matters, we saw a step change in money movement by our customers, moving from previously a 5% year-over-
year type of growth rate to up to 9% in 2019 versus 2018. Then the pandemic hit and growth of 2020 over 2019
was only 1%. But so far year-to-date, we're growing faster on a larger base than the 2019 9%-plus growth trend at
10% plus.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
The first quarter was a record dollar amount of money moved by Bank of America consumers. The trend is fully
on track, even though the economy has not yet fully reopened. March was a record month of spending by Bank of
America consumers and led to the highest ever quarter of consumer spend.
As you look also on the slides – note on slide 4, the lower level of card delinquencies has a spike from the expired
deferrals, and the [indiscernible] (00:05:46) has worked its way through the charge-offs. In addition, early-stage
delinquencies are at or near historic lows, suggesting low levels of card charge-offs again next year – or next
quarter, excuse me.
As the economy has improved, customers have continued to increase their business across our platform. When
you think about it from the customer's perspective, which is what we do as a business, and comparing across the
pandemic period of last 12 months, we have simply added more customers across every line of business, and
those customers are more digitally engaged in every business as well.
You're going to see later on slide 17 that we added nearly 1 million active digital customers this quarter, pushing
us past 40 million active users, led by increased use by boomers and seniors. We have more deposit and cash
management customers and balances in every business from Consumer, to Small Business, to Merrill Lynch, to
Private Bank, the business bank and the commercial bank across all franchises. New investment relationships in
our Consumer business's Merrill Lynch platform now total more than 3 million accounts and net new households
continue to grow in both Merrill Lynch and the private bank.
We saw aggregated client flows across our investment platforms of $48 billion in the quarter, bringing those total
investment assets to over $4 trillion with the range of those capabilities from our digital-only capabilities in our
Consumer business all the way through the great service and capabilities provided by our 20,000 wealth advisors.
We added new lending customers, whether through PPP and small business and business banking along with
broader traditional banking relationships in our middle market corporate clients. And we have helped existing and
new clients obtain funding to access market through our sales and trading investment banking platforms.
Combined sales and trading investment banking, revenue of $7.3 billion is the highest in a decade and is up 28%
year-over-year. Jimmy DeMare and Matthew Koder and the teams led by Tom Montag have done a great job
there. Our customer satisfaction levels across all these groups of clients rose during the pandemic. And the brand
loyalty of our company is at the highest it's been.
We also note that our employee engagement is the highest it's been. And we have driven our success to our
teammates this quarter and you'll note in our expenses with another broad-based bonus plan, which is the fourth
time we've done this. And with support provided to the communities we serve, our employees' sense of pride in
our company and what it does has reached new levels of satisfaction.
So with that being said, we do have some work to do in certain areas as we have for the last decade. I'd highlight
those three areas with a couple of comments on each. Those areas are loan growth, net interest income and
expense. On loan growth, there continues to be a lot of liquidity in the system and customer payments remain
high, which impacts the loan balances, and this is across the whole, consumers and companies. Pipeline
origination improving, but remained below pre-pandemic levels. We've reinstated all our credit standards back to
where they were before the pandemic and we remained highly focused on capturing loan growth as the economy
expands and continues to recover. The projected economic growth should cause the need for companies to
borrow, build inventory, increase hiring and invest, and do what they do in their businesses.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
As you can see from slide 4, Global Banking loans after falling in January appeared to have stabilized again in
March. We'll have to see how this plays out, but that's the first – the month of March was a good sign. Pipelines
continue to build, but line usage remains low. Card applications and mortgage originations continued to increase
in each of the last three quarters. This along with mortgage rates moving higher and driving lower prepayments
and runoff of current mortgage loans sets up Consumer loan growth.
That strong customer liquidity obviously negatively impacts loan growth, but is has benefited credit cost. We saw
quarter one net charge-offs remaining below pre-pandemic levels in dollars and percentage, further supporting
reduction in our credit reserve this quarter.
Now net interest income. We told you six months ago that we believed the third quarter would be the trough and
has proven to be so. Despite the drawdown of loans and two less days of interest in this current quarter, NII was
flat to fourth quarter of last year. As we move through 2021, we believe the benefits from a steepened interest
rate curve should begin to work its way into our revenue, driven by continued investment of our liquidity as well as
picking up those lost days of interest.
Thinking about the expected NII trajectory this year within the year ahead, I would set the stage as follows. If the
forward interest rate curve materializes and we see modest loan growth in the later quarters of the year, we ought
to see NII as we exit the fourth quarter of this quarter, $1 billion a quarter higher than the most recent level of
$10.3 billion in this quarter.
The last area I would highlight is expense. We had a large expense this quarter driven by several factors. Some
were seasonal impacts, some were good news and that they were volume and revenue-driven impacts and others
were not typical of our normal operating expense due to the charges taken. We expect a significant decline as
you look forward to the second quarter of 2021 in expense. We've seen the head count in our company start to
work its way back down due to attrition, especially as the specialized programs begin to run their course.
I'd also remind you that the first quarter is typically elevated for payroll tax expense and this year was about $350
million. Next, I would say roughly $500 million of our increase is driven by the improved activity and higher
revenue which of course is a positive. It's what we're in the business to do. The items I classify as differing from
our typical costs were as follows. First, given the progress made in our digital engagement with our customers
and other customer traffic behavior, we will continue to rationalize real estate for our teammates and our
customers and recorded impairment charge due to that of $240 million in the quarter.
Second, a portion of the equity awarded for last year's work for our Global Banking markets teammates had a
different retirement rule. And as previously reported, we changed that retirement rule which caused that to
accelerate in full this quarter instead of being amortized over the next four years.
Other costs worth noting include severance costs and special incentive award, recognizing a broad base of
200,000 teammates for their outstanding efforts during this pandemic. That award for the fourth time is built on
shared success awards the three times prior – that was given in three previous years.
Additionally, COVID expense remains elevated as we continue to help our clients through the various assistance
programs established by the government: PPP, unemployment claims, stimulus payment disbursement, and PPP
forgiveness. But broadly speaking, we have done a great job in helping customers with these programs. We've
now originated almost 500,000 PPP loans and have obtained forgiveness for our clients for 200,000 of those. We
processed $180 billion unemployment claims and $73 billion in EIP stimulus payments. Paul is going to share a

bit of the details in the quarter's expenses. But even after absorbing these expenses, our PPNR rose from fourth
quarter.
As we ended last year, we talked about a target for this year's expenses, meaning the 2021 fiscal year expenses,
to be similar to the $55 billion level in 2020. Given the charges this quarter, we would increase that target by
about $1.5 billion. However, I just want you to keep some perspective here. We reported $57 billion in expense for
the year 2015, six years ago.
Even with all the investments we have made in technology and the build-out of branches and new markets, new
sales resources and just having more customers, more activities, the inflation in healthcare and real estate and
other costs, moving our teammates – our starting wages from $15 to $20 an hour during that time period. We are
targeting 2021 expense at roughly to where it was in 2015, six years later and a lot bigger company later. That
discipline and operational excellence is what we do and you should expect us to continue that.
So, in summary, this quarter, we again drove responsible growth. We supported our employees by keeping them
safe and rewarding their efforts in the pandemic. We supported our customers by providing strong balance sheet
and resilient systems to transact. We supported our communities by supplying critical funding and driving
improvement toward racial and social equality with our increase in our $1 billion commitment to $1.25 billion.
We've already delivered over $300 million of that commitment.
At the same time, we delivered to you, our shareholders, $8 billion in earnings, generating return on tangible
common equity of 17% and returned $5 billion in capital to the shareholders in the first quarter. This shows you
we can both deliver for you our shareholders and deliver for our customers, our employees and our other
stakeholders and society.
With that, let me hand off to Paul to cover the quarter in a little more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. Good morning and hello, everyone. I'm starting on slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past
few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are
progressing through this health crisis rather than year-over-year.
In Q1, we earned net income of $8.1 billion or $0.86 per share, which compares to $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share
in Q4. The earnings improvement included strong revenue growth which more than offset higher expense.
Additionally, earnings also included a $2.7 billion reserve release which resulted in a $1.9 billion provision benefit.
Revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results, record investment banking fees, and record asset
management fees in our Wealth Management business while Consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge
against elevated Q4 holiday spending. With respect to returns, return on tangible common equity was 17.1%, and
ROA was 113 basis points.
Moving to the balance sheet on slide 8, the balance sheet expanded $150 billion versus Q4 to $2.97 trillion in total
assets. Deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher. Deposits grew $89 billion in the quarter and
are up $300 billion from Q1 2020. Note that as deposits continued to grow, loans declined $25 billion from Q4. We
deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities which increased $172 billion while cash balances
declined $54 billion and reverse repo also fell.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
It is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than one-third of our total balance sheet and has
surpassed $1 trillion.
On a period-end basis, our Global Markets balance sheet increased by $129 billion, coming off year-end seasonal
lows and as customers increased their activity with us. Note that, on an average basis, it is only up marginally
from the prior year and versus Q4 up only $40 billion. Shareholders' equity increased $1 billion. Earnings were
mostly offset by $4.5 billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in OCI of $1.8 billion driven by increase in
long bond rates.
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with the fourth quarter, standardized remains our binding approach
for us, and at 11.8%, our CET1 ratio is our binding metric. While the CET1 ratio declined 15 basis points from Q4,
it is 230 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $35 billion capital cushion.
The benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher RWA from the liquidity
deployed into mortgage-backed securities and growth in our Global Markets balance sheet.
Our supplemental ratio at quarter-end was 7% and 6.1% on a pro forma basis excluding the relief for deposits at
the fed and investments in treasuries. 6.1% versus the 5% minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for
growth in the balance sheet. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.
Let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet. I will focus on
averages as that is what drives NII. With respect to loans, on slide 9, you can see the downward trend across the
year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove pay-downs well above historic levels. I
would draw your attention to the linked quarter change. Global Banking commercial loans declined $16 billion.
But, as Brian noted earlier, we are seeing pipelines build, and balances have stabilized for more than a month, so
we are hopeful for a turnaround.
Loan payments by consumers continued to outpace originations with loans declining $14 billion in Consumer
Banking led by mortgages. Plus, we saw a normal seasonality in our card products as customers paid down
holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates. But what is also noteworthy is the linked-
quarter improvement in GWIM and Global Markets. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as
well as custom lending. In Global Markets, we relaxed some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen.
With respect to deposits on slide 10, we continued to see tremendous growth across the client base, not only
because of growth in the money supply, but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity
from existing customers.
Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion
on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.9 billion from Q1 2020 driven by the rate environment and lower
loan balances, but was relatively flat to Q4. Compared to Q4, we see this as a good outcome considering the
headwinds of two fewer days of interest, lower loan levels and modestly higher premium amortization expense.
These headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of
approximately $100 million from a legacy litigation settlement involving some securities. The net interest yield was
relatively stable, declining 3 basis points from Q4, and it was flat if you exclude global markets.
Reducing cash and repo, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in Q1, split across treasuries
and mortgage-backed securities. Securities increased $172 billion from year-end. On a weighted average basis
relative to what we were earning on the cash, we improved our yield on that roughly $170 billion by approximately
7

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
150 basis points. Now the improvement in yield could have been higher, however, but similar to Q4 purchases,
we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps, effectively keeping those securities floating.
As you will note, given all the deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity is rising. Our asset sensitivity to
rising rates remained significant, highlighting the value of our deposit and customer relationships. Sensitivity is
lower from the year-end levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline,
so the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates.
A few thoughts on NII for the remainder of the year. But first, please note that these forward-looking comments on
NII assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes, that the economy continues to recover, and that we
have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year. Given those assumptions, we expect some
improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters if mortgage rates follow the forward curve. At
$1.5 billion in Q1, write-off for premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite
high. So forward-looking comments include a lot of material moving parts, from rates, loan levels, and premium
amortization, but as Brian said, we believe 4Q 2021 NII could rise by as much as $1 billion from this quarter's
level.
Okay. Turning to slide 12 and expenses, Q1 expenses were $15.5 billion, $1.6 billion higher than Q4. I will add to
some of the remarks Brian mentioned earlier. First, Q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax
expense of about $350 million. Second, as a result of the current period's solid revenue performance and a better
outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year, we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased
processing costs. This added roughly $500 million to the quarter.
Third, we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense. We reversed a decision made
on some 2020 incentive comp awards, making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible. This
accelerated approximately $300 million of expense into Q1 that would have been expensed over four years. We
also recorded an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate realization, and we incurred $160 million of
severance charge as we move back towards business as usual with respect to our head count. This is based on
an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement, some associates might choose
severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company.
Lastly, our COVID costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employee-related costs were
offset by costs associated with restarting PPP originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claim
processing. COVID costs are proving a little slower – a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped.
Turning to asset quality on slide 13, government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this
pandemic. That support, coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline
under responsible growth, has resulted in low net charge-offs. Net charge-offs this quarter were $833 million or 37
basis points of average loans and were lower than Q4. And they were 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019
which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of $229 million in Q1.
With the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses, losses in every other category declined
from Q4.
Provision was a $1.9 billion benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower
loan balances resulted in a $2.7 billion release of credit reserves. Total Consumer reserve releases were $1.4
billion, driven primarily by card, while the Commercial release was $1.2 billion. Our allowance as a percent of
loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.8%, which still remained well above the 1.27% where we've begun 2020
following our day one adoption of CECL.

With respect to reserve setting assumptions, we continue to include a multitude of scenarios. Based upon our Q1
weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its 4Q 2019 level by the end of 2021. The weighted
scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be just north of 6%, which is in line with
March unemployment rate. For 2022, the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under 5.5% as
we exit the year. To the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we
expect our reserve levels will move lower.
On slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. Overall
Consumer net charge-offs rose $211 million from Q4, and absent the $229 million increase noted in card, other
losses declined. With respect to card losses, given the reduction in late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day
pipeline, we expect card losses to be lower in Q2. NPLs remained low despite a small uptick due to Consumer
real estate deferrals, which have limited expected loss content given healthy LTV ratios.
Moving to Commercial, net charge-offs declined $296 million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilized with
reservable criticized exposure and NPLs declining in the quarter. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality
of our commercial book remained solid and 90% of the exposures are either investment grade or collateralized.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15. Consumer Banking produced
another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows, reflecting the strength of our brand,
the innovation around digital and deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which has enabled us to capture
more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. The segment earned $2.7 billion in Q1 versus $2.6
billion in Q4 as the provision benefit more than offset lower, mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense.
Revenue declined 2%, reflecting lower card income from Q4's elevated holiday spending. Expenses moved
higher as a result of real estate impairment costs as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense. This also
caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to 142 basis points. Absent the impairment charge, the
cost of deposits would have been 131 basis points. As expected, net charge-offs rose in Q4 due to the flow-
through of the bulge in card delinquencies as noted earlier. A $1.4 billion reserve release resulted in a $617
million provision benefit in the quarter.
On slide 16, you can see the significant increase in Consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of
$924 billion are up 25% compared to Q1 2020 with nearly two-thirds of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down
to 3 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low interest checking.
Lastly, note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up $39 billion from Q4. We covered
loans earlier, so I would just note investment balances of $324 billion are up 53% year-over-year as customers
continued to recognize the value of our online offering.
As Brian noted and as you can see on slide 17, we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this
quarter. 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year. We continued to see
digital payments in Zelle taking hold across all our businesses. Zelle consumer dollar volume is up 72% year-
over-year, small business is up 182% year-over-year and 90% of our business-to-consumer payments in Global
Banking are now made via Zelle. As you can see, our digital assistant, Erica, continues to add users, capabilities
and usage. Plus, we are applying our success with Erica to other businesses as well.
Okay. Turning to Wealth Management, we continued to deliver solid organic growth, serve the comprehensive
banking and investment needs of clients, and manage risk responsibly. We experienced strong new household

acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market. This resulted in a record quarter with respect
to total client flows including near record AUM flows and record AUM fees.
Net income of $881 million improved 6% from Q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an
increase in expense. With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees were complemented by higher NII on the
back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related costs and seasonally
elevated payroll tax.
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continued to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent
clients. Client balances rose to a record $3.5 trillion, up $822 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels
as well as strong client flows. During Q1, our advisors added over 6,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and
nearly 700 net new relationships in the Private Bank.
Let's skip to slide 20 which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engage Wealth Management
clients. In Merrill and the Private Bank, our clients and advisors have both embraced the value of a digitally
enabled relationship, in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast, safe and secure interactions. Our
Wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise with 80% of Merrill households
digitally active. In Q1, we saw a record number of logins. Clients are logging in to trade, check balances and
originate loans with ease, all of which can be done through a simplified sign-in. We continue to enhance and
modernize the capabilities for both the client and advisor, and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators
as well as being recognized by third-parties.
Moving to Global Banking on slide 21, the business earned nearly $2.2 billion in Q1, improving $500 million from
Q4 driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue. While loan growth has been challenging, deposit growth has
been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records. The team produced $2.2 billion in firm-
wide investment banking fees growing year-over-year by 62% and 20% over Q4. Looking at revenue and
comparing to Q4, despite the higher IB fees, total revenue declined 3% driven by weather-related impairments on
some tax advantaged investments. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $1.2 billion in Q1 and
quarterly net charge-offs of $36 million fell by $278 million from Q4. Non-interest expense rose 14% from Q4
reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier. Additionally, the strong IB performance and improved
outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in Q1.
Looking at the balance sheet on slide 22, average deposits moved up relative to Q4 as customers remained
highly liquid. Year-over-year, deposits are up an impressive 27% while rate paid is at an historic low. As noted
earlier, loans declined early in the quarter but stabilized late in the quarter.
Wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continued to grow driven by the same ease,
safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our Consumer customers enjoy. We present some
wholesale digital highlights on slide 23.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 24, results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid
year-over-year improvement and an even more significant increase relative to Q4. As I usually do, I will talk about
the segment's results excluding DVA. This quarter net DVA was negligible, but the year-ago quarter had a $300
million gain. Global Markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q1, more than double the level of Q4 and up 39%
from Q1 2020. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 26% on higher sales and trading and equity
underwriting fees. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by volume-related expenses in both card and
trading and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards.

Sales and trading contributed $5.1 billion to revenue, increasing 17% year-over-year driven by a 22%
improvement in FICC and a 10% increase in equities. FICC results reflected gains in commodities and strong
results in credit, mortgage and municipal products versus relative weakness in the year-ago period. This was
partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products. The strength in equities was
driven by a strong trading performance in cash. The business produced strong return delivering a 22% return on
capital in Q1.
Finally, on slide 26, we show All Other which reported profits of $257 million compared to Q1 2020. The
improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in ESG activities this
year. The year-ago quarter also included a modest reserve build. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 12%, and
excluding the tax credit driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 23%. For the full
year, absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items, we expect an effective tax rate to be in
the range of 10% to 12%.
Okay. With that, let's go to Q&A.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if we could just – you gave us a lot of detail on the expense side. I just wanted to
try to get a jumping off point on the second quarter. I think with all your comments, it gets you to the low to mid-
$14 billion range. Want to see if that's right.
And then if you could give us the right perspective, meaning if you look, you all were able to keep total expenses
flat for many years while you grew the franchise. Now, the economy is growing, capital markets are very strong,
and the expense dollars have crept up. But I don't believe BofA has an expense creep problem, but I wonder if
you could address that and give us the right perspective to look at. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So, in terms of the second quarter, I think you're about right. We expect expenses just north of $14 billion
depending on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the COVID costs.
In terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses, we agree with you. I think, as Brian noted in his
opening comments, we've managed not to increase expenses for years now, and we've absorbed merit
increases, investments, minimum wage, improvement in benefits, all the dramatic increase in processing
volumes, digital increases. So where we have sort of – as talked about on other calls, we have been using
operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future.
I think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time. We've talked about
maybe expenses rising maybe at a 1% level per year, and I think that's probably the best guidance we could give
you. Absent again some of the ins and outs, we had a lot of variability this quarter. And obviously, we're sitting
here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of COVID expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had

all hoped, but they're going to come out. There's no question about that. And so we'll get back to kind of a normal
level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long term relative to revenue.

Thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. Maybe just one other one. We've seen a lot of growth in the
private credit markets, and it started out strong in middle market lending. It's transitioning and doing some now
large corporate lending. There's specialized lending in aircraft and transportation now. So I'm curious given the
breadth of your franchise, all those things I mentioned are kind of in your backyard. That's just a lending
relationship. They don't have the same franchise you have. But curious if you see the growth in private credit as a
significant competitor in your traditional backyard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I'd say, Glenn, depending on the type of loan, people have been in these markets for years. Think mortgage, think
other types of consumer credit and then the commercial side. So, sure, that has an impact. But our job is to
compete through it. But the reality, what's having an impact now, frankly, is the draw rates and lines of credit and
stuff are low. And companies that are operating well, there's companies that still need to get through the
pandemic impact, just aren't using the lines, and that's bumping along the bottom and we've shown you those
long-term charts.
So we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses, small businesses. We feel good
about they're getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back. And the
services and rate we can provide are competitive. And so I don't think that'll ever change, and I think it reaches
further. Sometimes it reaches a step we won't do as a company, obviously, in terms of leverage – extra amounts
of leverage and things like that. But we feel we're very strong and competitive, and before the pandemic hit, we in
middle market were growing mid-single digits and we'd expect to return back to that level.

that goes into effect in the third quarter, you and your peers will be free to buy back your stock in the fashion in
which you see it fits best for you guys. Can you give us some color on how you're thinking about that $25 billion
buyback, on how it will proceed after you get the okay? I'm assuming you're going to pass CCAR, of course, in
June, that gives you the green light to do the buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, we'll – so let's start with a couple of things. One is the number goes up this quarter because the average of
the four quarters is you move forward a quarter and that's the higher average, so we'll be able to do more this
quarter. And then assuming the new rules come into effect in July, we have substantial cushion and we'll look to
bring that cushion down. We're not going to – we're going to maintain a cushion over the [ph] borrower
requirements 9.5% (00:47:40). We'll maintain a cushion over that. You'd expect us to move fairly apace to start to
bring us closer to the cushion. That was honestly held up by the suspension last year this time of our ability to
repurchase stock at all for the first – for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, which if
you go back and think about our original CCAR filings, we were going to buy back a substantial amount.
So we'll get back in the saddle and drive it forward. And also because the earnings power of the company, work
on – continue to work the dividend. And so expect us to get right after as soon as we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And, Paul, you talked about the loan loss reserve levels. And when you compare them to your day
one CECL number from January of 2020, obviously, you're considerably higher than that number. Can you share
with us the outlook for potential loan loss reserve releases? And could you see an environment where you could
approach that day one reserve level, considering the economy when you look at your own forecast that you gave
us today is much stronger than what it was on the day one in January 2020, can you give us some further color
on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. Just on reserves, absent a deterioration in environment, which we don't expect, we believe the reserves will
continue to come down in the coming quarters as we remain – as the remaining uncertainties continue to
diminish.
In terms of the reserve versus sort of day one CECL, every quarter, we are reserving based upon the size and
mix of our portfolio at that moment and our view of the future based upon independent sources. So, as you think
about that, you've got to recognize that our portfolio has changed. For example, card which, as you know, has
some of the highest reserve rates, is down 25% from day one. So you really need to think about how the mix has
changed. You just can't go back to our reserve level on day one, which I think was 127 basis points if I'm not
mistaken, and just apply that to today's numbers. I think you've got to do a little bit of a product mix there to get
back. We've done that work, and it shows we have still a significant, I'll call it, cushion to day one.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I have two opposing views, and hoping you can help me reconcile them as it relates to efficiency. On the one
hand, it's like your slides are very positive. Global Bank, 74%, digital connections; Wealth 80% of households;
Consumer, digital still growing and the unit cost per dollar of deposit, what, 130 basis points. It's like best-in-class.
So all that technology progress is noted. On the other hand, I look at slide 12 and I see the efficiency ratio and I
see the expenses and I hear the higher guidance for expenses for this year. So I guess if you could help me
reconcile these positive underlying trends with this number on the page of 68% efficiency ratio. And I do
recognize that you're calling out a lot of expenses. The $1.6 billion increase quarter-over-quarter, should we
consider that kind of just one-time? And where should this efficiency ratio go over time? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Mike, you pointed out the operating posture of the businesses continues to improve, but as you go across
page 12, you've got to remember, and you well know this, that in the stuff on the left hand side of the page, you
had a rate environment that finally after years had come up to some level of Fed funds rate and LIBOR rates and
stuff, and that helped our efficiency ratio move under 60%. But even if you look at this quarter, it's 68%, and you
back out the type of expenses that you drop in the low-60s. And then NII improvement will – because that frankly,
as you well know, comes with very little expense attached to it and, i.e., that we don't need more branches and
more infrastructure or even more commercial bankers as the loan usage goes up and the spread off of our floors
due to our massive deposit base. So I think you should expect it – even on a pro forma basis, you could see the
low-60s and you expect it to move back in the levels you see here, as we move through the year, pick up the NII,
and then if rates start to move up, you'd even pick up more.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Mike, on the technology side, we did – well, I mean technology initiatives last year were 3-and-change, and this
year will go up frankly a bit in those numbers we gave you because we continue to take advantage of that. And so
I think 25 branches opened up in new cities this quarter, and we're seeing the success from that. Markets that we
weren't in two, three, four, five years ago, we're now moving in the top 10 all organic and driving off of that.
And then salespeople. Now that's what we've probably lightened up last year just because the opportunities
weren't there. But you're going to see us continue to reposition people from the efficiencies in the OpEx program

to the front. And so head count rose really to support the exigencies of the circumstances. When you couldn't
have your teammates [indiscernible] (00:54:21) each other, you had to have a few more of them move and the
issues that were there for social distancing and working from home and overstaffing because of high-risk
employees. So we ran up a little higher, and now you're starting to see us drift down. So that core number of head
count would drive our expenses. But the reality is we invested at the same rate last year in everything except for
incremental commercial bankers probably than we did in past years, and we're going to do it again this year
because the payback is huge.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last follow-up. Just on the COVID-related expenses, seems like a little bit of a longer tail than maybe
you had expected. When do you think some of those come off? I mean, you've treated your employees well with
the special payments and all the other efforts that you've made. Is that like another quarter or two? Are we toward
the end of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we're blending it – it's blending down because the situation change; obviously as schools reopen and things
like that, we can normalize the – we started last year this time and said teammates, when you work from home,
we'll give you $100 a day to hire somebody to come into your home, take care of your kids, so you can do a great
job for our clients. That's why our client scores continued to rise during the pandemic. Obviously as schools have
re-opened, we've tailored that program and will normalize it at the end of the second quarter, that's one thing.
Obviously PPP, Mike, it got extended again, but as we're seeing the volumes be more modest this time, it could
start to shape those teammates out. The forgiveness program will take us longer just because it's a tail obviously,
but we're through 200,000 done. And so you'll see that happen, and the extra cleaning and meals for the
teammates and the testing and all the things we've done, that all will come down as we sort of normalize
operations over the next six months. But it took longer because things like PPP came out two more times since –
two or three times, I guess running four would be the right number, but. So it's good.
But we're doing what we need to do to support our customers. Half a billion – or half a million, excuse me, loans
originated under four different programs, so the constantly changing rules – at the peak, we had 10,000 people
working on it. Now we've got about 3,000 there and 3,000 in forgiveness, and we can work it back down. So think
over the next six months, you'll see it start to blend down piece after piece after piece.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Thanks. Sorry, on the expenses again, just on the COVID expenses that you were discussing, Brian, with Paul,
remind us what's the kind of size ballpark of that. I'm trying to think about the $56.5 billion total expenses and if
we took off the $500 million kind of special stuff you announced this quarter, and then the COVID costs which
15


Bank of America Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
might be $1 billion a year. Like is the – might you rebase at some point at $55 billion before business growth and
things like that? I'm just trying to kind of put some numbers on it. Is that reasonable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I would think of COVID expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $400 million of net COVID expenses.
That was roughly flat, by the way, to last quarter. As Brian said, we ramped up for the new PPP and
unemployment processes – claims, but we did offset some of that ramp-up with lower expenses associated with
childcare and supplemental pay and things like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, John, just to be simpleminded about it, the reason why we had – we told you the full year is going to be
higher is because we think it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion higher in the first quarter here that wasn't sort of in our mind
because of timing differences on some of the compensation matters and other things. So as you well know, we'll
get it – we're pushing it back down as fast as possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then, Paul, just wanted to follow up, when you're talking about the interest rate
disclosures, you mentioned that the model doesn't assume deployment – automatic deployment of liquidity
anymore. Could you just explain that? Like what changed because of rate moves or deployment? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The model doesn't assume automatic deployment of liquidity. I think we're talking about the 100 up and 25 down
in the disclosures.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That's [indiscernible] (00:58:38).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I mean we got a little bit less asset sensitive because we deployed some liquidity in the fourth quarter and
in the first quarter, and so now that's in the baseline, and when rates shock up, you obviously – you're not
deploying that liquidity at a higher rate any more. So it kind of moved from the sensitivity into the baseline. You
see what I'm saying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Got you. Got you. Okay. Got it. And the next thing was just the NII ramp that could happen to get you $1
billion higher by the fourth quarter, how do you see that distributed? Is that kind of evenly or is it kind of based on
the second half loan growth coming back?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, look, we've been fairly careful about our guidance. There's a lot of moving pieces here. You've got
amortization of premium that can move around. You've got loan growth which is hard to predict. So we want to be
careful about being too specific about how we get from here to there. I think we feel very good about getting to
there. Again, the guidance that we gave you that NII in the fourth quarter could be $1 billion higher than what it
was in the first quarter, that's based upon the forward curve materializing and some modest loan growth in the
back half of the year.
We've got some flexibility because we do have liquidity, can go faster or slower on in terms of investing. We'd like
to put that in loan growth and not necessarily into securities, but we will invest it over time. We've got to see the
amortization expense start to come down. It hasn't come down yet, even though mortgage rates have gone up.
And like I said, we've got to see some loan growth and we'll pick up at least two days here. So that's the best
perspective I can give you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q

Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the deployment of liquidity that you've done. You did a lot this quarter,
last quarter. If we look back since the end of 2019, most of your deposits have been deployed into securities, and
most of those securities, I think, are longer term mortgage-backed that aren't hedged. I know you said some of the
treasuries were hedged, but that's a small portion of what you added. So I guess just conceptually, like is this
signaling that you think rates have kind of gone up – kind of the big moves already happened for the next few
years? Are you kind of thinking loan growth is not going to come back that much or what's the thought of locking
in so many assets at these rates this quarter and the last couple quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Well, let me back up because I want to make sure that everybody is clear about kind of what we have
done. You went all the back to 2019. If you go all the way back to year-end 2019, deposits were up $450 billion
and loans were down $80 billion. So we created $530 billion of liquidity to deploy somewhere, plus we're going to
see some more deposit growth. So the $530 billion of liquidity had to be deployed somewhere. Through the end
of Q1, securities are up $380 billion, and cash and equivalents are up $150 billion to $300 billion. But as I said in
the remarks, we bought treasuries, but on about $150 billion of those treasuries, we have interest rate swaps. So
you can really think of the $300 billion of cash as being $450 billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or
invest for term or other uses.
So we've been balancing liquidity, capital and earnings throughout this whole process. We don't tend to make
bets on interest rates one way or another. We just want to make sure that we can deliver for our customers no
matter what happens, and I think we've been trying to do that as we've gone through this pandemic. Again, it's all
about balancing liquidity, capital and earnings.

Matthew O'Connor Q

Okay. And then just separately, in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned about increasing hold limits a little
bit. I think you're referring to the trading businesses. But if you could just circle back on that concept and give a
little more detail on kind of where you were and where you are now in terms of the hold limits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, look, we – in terms of – if you think about pre-pandemic underwriting criteria, we are on the
consumer side, I think, back to pre-pandemic now. In terms of the commercial side, there are still the affected
industries that we're watching carefully, but everywhere else, I think we're back to pre-pandemic. And in light of
the size of our company, in light of the need for loan growth, I think we're relaxed a little bit on some hold levels,
particularly in Global Markets where they have more of a moving and storage mentality around loans and what
they do for customers. So, yeah, we're just taking a few maybe bigger positions than we might have otherwise
taken pre-pandemic. But it's no real change in the underwriting standards. The company is bigger. We have more
liquidity. We have more capital, so we think all of this is appropriate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q

And that's with respect to large corporate loans; not the trading book, just to clarify.

Yes. Okay.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
But just across loan growth, just to think about it, what's going to drive the company's P&L also on the Consumer
side, especially, if you look at it by business. So the Wealth Management business actually has grown a little bit.
You got the commercial business down and Consumer is down. Consumer is largely down because of mortgage
churn, but the big thing that happened is cards came down. And what's been interesting to watch now, and so
because we pulled back, this time last year's unemployment went to 15%. Everybody pulled back their
underwriting criteria on that. We've now reinstated, as Paul said.
So what's happened? We did 1 million units of new cards a quarter. Going into the last year's first quarter, it fell as
low as [ph] 400. It's back up to 600-and-change (01:05:16) already and moving north on that, and if you look by
month, it's stacking back up. And if you look at where that's coming from, obviously the branch system which
basically was run at around 2,500 of the 4,300 branches for the last six, eight months, nine months is only
18

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
catching back up as it opens up and sales come in. So that bodes well obviously on the Consumer side on the
cards which are most important.
Mortgages production will continue to get back up, and prepayments slow down in a slightly higher rate
environment. You'll see that bodes well there. GWIM has some of the mortgage aspects, but on the type of
lending that GWIM does to affluent, wealthy people, they've done a good job. And they've actually seen that grow.
And then you go to the business banking, middle market, and that's all line usage. And so that should come
through.
In order for the economy to expand, 7% this year is what our Bank of America team has of that, at some point
companies have to access capital to meet that final demand, and you should see that usage come up. So even in
things like the car business because there just aren't the cars to sell, you're seeing line usages down at lower
levels. So as you think across things that hold levels and things that Paul is talking about enable us to push a little
harder just because of the sheer size of our company. But if you think about the flywheel that we have in the
company as a production engine, having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with 15% unemployment
peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of the last year, then turning that crank back up
and just watch that flywheel start to take off, that's what we have good confidence in, in terms of getting right back
on the loan growth. But if you add it all together and we grew 5%, it would be $45 billion of loans. So to Paul's
point, you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional
deposits with the Commercial and Consumer.

Question, Brian, on just capital, capital allocation. And you were one of the only GCIBs to really kind of trim down
so that your GCIB number didn't go up recently. And I'm wondering if you're thinking about the opportunities there
to lean into a higher GCIB, maybe do more in capital markets. I know traditionally you've been looking to keep
your RWAs in markets very tight, and I'm wondering if there's any thought to maybe leaning in at this stage given
all the excess capital and liquidity that you have. Is that potentially an option that's on the table in addition to the
buybacks that you discussed earlier?

Yeah. So, Betsy, and the two are not mutually exclusive at all except way – at the margin way away from where
we are now. But with stock price increases and all the things that go into that calculation, as you well know, and
they're not all related to straight risk in terms of sheer size and just things that go in, it is harder to maintain where
we were at the end of last year. And you might expect that we may move up a bucket and take advantage of that
by actually expanding the business in the markets business with the opportunities there based on the capabilities
that Jimmy and the team and Tom and the team have put together.
So why would you do that? The reason why we do that is our clients have been growing, and we've kept about a
third of the size. And even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things, it has come down
around 20% the size of the company, and the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the company's
overall size. But the company has grown around it another step. And so we told Tom – Tom and the team are
working on ideas to continue to do that. We're a little bigger now than we were at year-end obviously first quarter
activity, but you shouldn't expect us to come down.
Now, those ratios aren't effective for a bit of time here, so we'll see how it plays out. But if the opportunities are
there, we'll take them. The team has done a great job and managed the risk well. Look at the trading results for
the quarter. Look at it for last quarter. Look at it throughout the pandemic. They've done a great job in managing
risk, and we're balancing and we're proud of them on the work they've done. And we're going to support them with
some more capital.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then, separately, one of the most tedious discussions that I have with people is
on comping your skill set in digital consumer apps and everything you're doing there not only for consumer but
also for corporate and SMBs with FinTech players. And I say it's tedious because you have huge market
presence, okay, but I don't feel like you're getting your message out there beyond this call. So have you given any
thought to trying to get the message of what you've done for consumers in the digital and the FinTech that you
actually are bringing to your clients beyond the four walls of your clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, let's always start with the first thing, the reason why we do this is to serve our clients and do a great job, and
it flows through the numbers. As Mike said earlier, the idea that we run this huge Consumer business at a cost
advantage which is significant due to the digitalization of all the consumer activity, due to the way customers
interact with us, the way we can help them, the way we can give guideposts, and frankly the way we can take the
fee structure out, and that's – we've dropped overdraft fees dramatically over the years and made up for it in
terms of efficiency and other types of things.
And so we get the word out. We tell everybody we're winning all kinds of awards and the lists go on and on in
terms of the different ranking agencies. And you've seen it in the Merrill Edge growth, that's over $300 billion now.
And so our job is to do a great job for our customers and I think I'll leave it to you and your colleagues to debate
the relative merits of a FinTech versus ours. But I will tell you for a company making $8 billion and having 40
million new digital customers that are fully active on the Consumer side, 0.5 million on the digital on the Corporate
side, the impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from even with extra money of $1.5 billion or so in the first
quarter from six years ago shows the impact of the ability to digitize this company, and we learned more about
this in the last year in areas that we didn't do it.

So we'll keep pushing it out there. You can help us tell the story. But the reality is that the number one person we
want to understand is our customers and that means attrition. Attrition of the customers is way down, the
penetration of the wallet's way up. Just look on the Wealth Management statistics we threw in and see how that –
they've adapted to it. These are major changes, the size of which don't exist much out there. So we'll keep
pounding away, you keep telling the story, we'll keep telling the story. But the key is it's producing. It's producing
the kind of earnings we're producing and the kind of efficiencies we're producing which continues to be down to
our benefit going forward.
The neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with it, where we've been going with it. So, Erica, there's
just nothing close to it out there and driving with volumes and things; Zelle, if you look at the charts and the pages
and show it. So it's the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and
their things for the mass market and their investments. So we feel good about it. We'll tell the story as often as we
can, but the reality is that we'd like to see us keep growing the number of customers and driving it and driving it on
an integrated basis.
We're putting major investments in a couple areas. We had to improve merchant services, payments on the
commercial side at the merchant level. And we're putting major investments in the 401(k) technology to push that.
We're number seven in that business. It's the lowest market position of any business we have, number six or
seven, whatever we are. So these are major investments we're making, hundreds of millions of dollars a year that
go into that expense base that are paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses.

Operator: And our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on the NII outlook and really specific to premium amortization.
Just given the sheer amount of growth we've seen in the MBS portfolio, the deployment of all the excess liquidity,
Paul, I was hoping you could help size what the premium and benefit would be if we did see prepayment speed
revert to more normal levels? And how much of that benefit is contemplated in the $1 billion increase in the exit
rate for 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So let me just give you a couple of perspectives. One, the premium amortization in the first quarter was
about $1.5 billion. And as you point out, the securities portfolio has grown. So, as you try to size what it could
come down to, you just can't go back to last year and look at what it was because the portfolio has gotten a lot
bigger. That's sort of one.
Two, as I think about that $1 billion, I would say the most important driver would be the modest loan growth, and
the second most important driver would be the reduction in premium amortization. So maybe that's enough
guidance right there. Again, we're not going to go down to where it was in Q1. Really think 4Q 2019 because
we've grown so much, but it's going to be meaningful in terms more than a few hundred million dollars in terms of
that guidance we gave you.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Understood. And for my follow-up, just wanted to ask on capital. If I look at your SLR ratio excluding the
relief and your CET1 ratios, if I assume maybe like a 10.5% target on CET1, 5.25% on SLR, the CET1 is still your
binding constraint today. But just looking at the sheer amount of balance sheet growth you guys saw this past
quarter, I think it was about $150 billion or so, our analysis suggests that you maybe have another $160 billion to
$200 billion of balance sheet growth headroom before the SLR becomes binding. And as we consider
expectations just for additional QE Fed balance sheet growth, how are you preparing for that potential? What sort
of mitigating actions might you take if the SLR does in fact become binding?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's just way out there, Steven. I don't think your numbers are right. [indiscernible] (01:17:00) take you through
some calculations, but I think the number is a lot bigger than you think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. We've done that work, and we've come up with a bigger number in terms of balance sheet capacity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, on the SLR, it's 100 basis points times a much bigger base or 75 basis points, in your example, to maintain
5.25%, so it's multiples of that. It's bigger than what we've grown so far [indiscernible] (01:17:21).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. I guess, I can – I think what the difference is there is the lens of like what constraint becomes more binding
and it's the SLR. I recognize you have excess under both. But if the ratio is going to shake out sub-6, pro forma
that relief, I guess, at a 5% ratio, that's $500 billion of capacity to grow. But in terms of like where you have the
most excess, it looks like SLR becomes binding in relatively short order which is maybe a couple more quarters of
$150 billion plus growth in the balance sheet. So, I guess, that's what I was trying to get at is, would you look to
mitigate it given it becomes a little bit more binding than your CET1 constraints?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We've managed all the capital ratios to maintain the minimum requirement. That's not the issue. But I think it's
hundreds of billions of dollars away, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. We're at 6.1% pro forma, right? So April 1. And that's $700 billion-ish of capacity down to the regulatory
minimum. As you said, we'd want to have a buffer, but that's the rough math.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Okay. Fair enough. I can take it offline with Lee later on anyway. But that's very helpful in how you framed it. So
thanks very much for taking the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And the next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe first on just maybe the cadence for card charge-offs. Obviously we had a little bit of
an increase this quarter, but 30-plus day delinquencies are now back down to almost near lows. Should we
expect – I think we hit charge-offs that were in the 400s in the fourth quarter. Are we heading back towards that or
how do we think – you have lower balances. How do we think about the trajectory of card charge-offs given your
view of the delinquencies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
If you go to page 4, Jim, you can see it. You kind of summarized it, but we went from 400s up to 600s, so it'll turn
back down just because look at the charts. You can see that what produces next quarter's charge-offs is
obviously on the right hand side of this page, and it's coming down. And so you have balances lower, but also you
just have sheer delinquency. And as you think further out, it's going to come from the left hand side of the page
and migrate to the right from actual charge-offs. Leave aside the projected and provisioning under the CECL, but
just – so you've got it right, it comes down. And you would hope, frankly, that if we get the growth, it might change
this dynamic in six months or something like that just because it takes a while to get any delinquency out of
anything, maybe even much longer than that, but this bodes well for the next couple of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. So I mean the reason I ask is that if you look at charge-off ratios late last year, they were lower than pre-
COVID levels. So you still think we can sort of keep that very low level at least for now until balances maybe start
to grow more significantly. Is that the takeaway?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, they'll probably – yeah, they'll go down as balances grow because there will be no delinquency, then a year
later when the delinquency from those balances, whatever minor amount it is, comes through, it might add to it.
And so the denominator effect will push even down further on percentages as the balances go up near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. Okay. And maybe my follow-up on the technology side, you guys did an acquisition, a small one obviously,
of Axia in your merchant processing business. Can you just sort of give your thoughts on the opportunity set as
you build out that platform? Are there more acquisitions do you think involved? What's your excitement level, I
guess, of building that platform out?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Look, it's a great little company that we can put across the platform, has a wonderful market position where it
plays, and we're very proud of the deal. But the key is that we – you've got to go back to the whole history of
merchant services. We sold half of it in a joint venture 15 years ago now or whatever it was, raised some capital.
Come forward, we bought it back. Remember, that's one of the reasons why the expense run rate moved up by
$800 million, $900 million a year that people forget about is because we brought that in last year for half a year
and it wasn't in two years ago. But the reason why we brought it back is really to invest around the platform.
So what's exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area. What's exciting about it is
the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a non-owned sales force selling it in our
small business and our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there can help deliver the
product. And then what's really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that we've been working on for
commercial payments. So it's the integration of the P2P, Zelle to small business, and all these payment gateways
which is outside the traditional merchant business, but you have to be completely flexible along all payment
schemes to actually root it, much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them. And real-time
contemporaneous value exchange.
So what we're doing with real-time payments and Zelle in combination into the business platforms through the
payment gateways, these are all exciting things. Then you go larger end, it's the different elements and
blockchain payments and everything else. So that's the core of the business on the commercial side, but it goes
all the way from small business all the way up to large companies. And so that investment was part of that. The
new investment's part of that. And you'll expect us to keep driving at the implementation. The good news is we're
getting the network effect of Zelle and things like that when you look at those pages, that Zelle's half the credit
card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now. So you noodle on that for a minute, think 35
million credit card people out there charging, the Zelle is reaching half if it, checks down 25% over the last couple
of years in terms of checks written volume by our consumers. So you get the network effect of that and then you
get the merchants to use it with real time.
So this was all part of a thing that Thong Nguyen and Mark Monaco and the team are leading [indiscernible]
(01:23:55) on the commercial side that you should expect to see a lot. A lot of investment has been made
including a major replacement of system that's coming through the P&L this year and the change in bringing the
people fully on balance sheet. And a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made.

Hey. Thanks. Just one question on just card and stimulus, and how do you guys get the sense of how much of the
stimulus and incremental deposit growth is sticking around versus now kind of starting to be spent? And what's
the trade-off with regards to the staging around that re-leveraging or that balance growth that might start to come
over time in the card business specifically? Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Yeah. I think just on – it depends, literally, when you look in customers' earnings power and things like that. But
largely I think, Paul, last I saw was 30-odd percent of the stimulus money has been spent to make it – to be
simpleminded about it, and so the other 70% is sitting in people's accounts. It's a little bit different by stratification
of earnings power of the household. And so that's to be spent. That bodes well for economic reopening and stuff.
And has that had an effect on balances on card and stuff? Yes, because consumers have used it to pay down
their debt. And part of what has been spent has been spent to pay down card balances. And then with limited
travel, you're just not getting as much use. But the good news is you've watched January to February to March
with the virus and vaccine pathways come into the fore. You're starting to see the purchase numbers go up. And
the payments rate went way up, as you observed last year, 30% through last year in this quarter. But you'd expect
that that might be more constant than the usage rate would go up and start to drive some balance growth which is
good news.
So the good news is that consumers are healthy from every aspect. We have no deferrals left except in the
mortgage business. So all the debate we had about those last year this time through the system. Delinquencies
down, consumers sitting with money in their accounts, and the economy opened up, which bodes well and that's
what you saw on the retail sales numbers today. And you expect those numbers to even be higher in the month of
April because March was a partly reopened month and the weather wasn't too pleasant in the Northeast if you
want to eat outside in the northern parts of the central country.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And that's the offset – the offset is in Jim's question about that better credit could stick as an offset
as well if there's still 70% sitting around. So we'll take that trade-off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And remember, where we play – yeah, where we lend money in the consumer space, we never came close to
what the projected losses were. We decided that the model was projected that you knew by watching the
consumer delinquency and unemployment levels of our consumers, they are much lower than society. And as
that became clearer, that's what you're seeing coming through the reserve releases right now.
