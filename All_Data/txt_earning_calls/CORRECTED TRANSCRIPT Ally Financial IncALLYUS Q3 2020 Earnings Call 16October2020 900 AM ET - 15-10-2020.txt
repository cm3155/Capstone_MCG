Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to review our results. Slide number 4
includes highlights from the third quarter, demonstrating performance across all of our lines of business. I'll begin
with a broader perspective on these results, which serve as further validation around our ability to continuously
deliver.
Our steady execution over the past several years positions us for success in a variety of operating environments.
We're guided by a consistent set of strategic priorities and a customer centric philosophy to always do it right. Our
results show this focus is resonating, particularly during challenging environments as we're operating in today.
This simple, but effective approach echoes throughout the culture at Ally and shows up in the innovative,
engaging and leading actions we've taken on behalf of our customers and it's further evidenced within our
community efforts where we've committed time and increased resources to effect positive and lasting change.
Turning to the quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.25 and core ROTCE was 15.2%. These record setting levels
reflected revenue expansion from embedded balance sheet tailwinds and diversified income sources combined
with credit outperformance. Our balance sheet strength is apparent across capital, liquidity and reserves, where
levels remain near the highest in Ally's history.
In auto, we decisioned 3.2 million applications generating $9.8 billion of consumer originations, our highest
quarterly volume in five years. We continue to leverage our broad market reach interacting with over 90% of
franchise dealers in the US. Auto market trends remain encouraging. Industry new vehicle sales closed the gap to
prior year levels throughout the quarter. In fact, the rebound in sales over the past five months took five years to
achieve following the past financial crisis. Used vehicle sales have demonstrated particularly strong performance,
outpacing prior year levels every month since May. As a result, overall dealer profitability rebounded to the
highest levels in several years during the quarter, more than offsetting a difficult Q2.
Ally's new origination yields of 6.95% represented another quarter of disciplined underwriting and combined with
net charge-offs of 64 basis points drove expanded risk-adjusted returns. This was the lowest third quarter loss
level for Ally since 2013 when our portfolio consisted mainly of new subvented loans.
Generally speaking, the US consumer entered 2020 on solid footing and it demonstrated a higher degree of
resiliency despite significant and ongoing challenges aided by meaningful and necessary fiscal stimulus. While
recent trends suggest a broader recovery is underway in various pockets of the economy, we're mindful of the
currently expired stimulus benefits and the ongoing uncertainty around the outlook of COVID. Unemployment
levels remain above pre-pandemic levels, labor participation has declined and recent layoff announcements have
picked up across harder hit travel and entertainment industries.
The growing disparate impact being felt across educational, income and racial backgrounds is troubling and
speaks to a more fundamental issue we're facing as a society, reinforcing for us the corporate citizenship's
commitments we've made. Against this backdrop, we're remaining focused and balanced.
We're proud to continue serving our customers, including actions we've taken to keep them in their cars and
homes. Our deferral program serves as a real-time example of this where our higher than industry take rates were
driven by the early, easy and largely digital approach we provided our customers in a time of uncertainty. Beyond
strong performance we've heard from many who described how the program provided them with a crucial
opportunity to devote focus and attention to unexpected life events they faced as a result of COVID. Again, this is

doing it right. And while many questioned the level of actions we took earlier this year, Jenn will show you the
stout performance of the deferral population in just a few minutes.
Within insurance, written premiums of $333 million increased meaningfully quarter-over-quarter despite
persistently low dealer inventories, while retail underwriting stabilized throughout the quarter. Investment income
remained robust highlighting our ability to generate diversified income.
Turning to our consumer and commercial banking products, momentum continued to build during the quarter.
Total deposits increased 13% year-over-year, including a record third quarter driving $17.1 billion of retail growth
in 2020. Our retail deposit customer base of $2.2 million expanded for the 40th consecutive quarter. Two-thirds of
account openings continue to be sourced from younger generations and the vast majority of inflows still come to
us from traditional banks, plus practically no outflows to neo banks.
Ally Home, Ally Invest and Ally Lending continue to make considerable progress towards our long-term objectives.
We generated the highest origination levels since launching our mortgage offering with improving loan profitability.
Our partnership with Better.com is another example of providing our customers with elegant, simple and largely
digital experiences. Brokerage accounts at Invest grew 16% year-over-year.
Ally Lending generated $167 million of volume and entered the retail point of sale segment through two key
partnerships. Our capabilities in healthcare, home improvement and retail position us well in the rapidly growing
payment ecosystem. Corporate finance held for investment balances ended at $5.9 billion, a 17% increase year-
over-year, while credit performance remained stable.
Turning to slide number 5, we've included a snapshot of our competitive advantages, which will position us to
generate sustainable expansion for years to come. Our established auto and insurance businesses are
foundational to our ongoing success and results, representing market-leading businesses with proven products,
services and scale. We've grown our dealer base for 10 years expanding our reach through both established and
emerging players.
Our use of technology and digital tools within auto has dramatically expanded this year. We modernized our entire
servicing platform, are increasing the use of data analytics throughout the underwriting process, have completely
rebuilt the technology stack on SmartAuction, our online digital auction site, and have rolled out digital self-service
tools and portals which again simplified and streamlined the deferral experience for our customers. So, while this
is a mature business, we continue to make it stronger.
Ally Bank was an early disruptor and we've continued to leverage the momentum behind our digitally focused
products in a customer-centric manner. We've differentiated through frictionless experiences built through a data-
driven approach in innovative tech. Our scalable platform is established, but nimble. Our customer base has
grown rapidly, remains loyal to Ally and our active users within our ecosystem. We're offering a broad array of
products through award-winning platforms and service levels. Combined with an amazing culture and continued
edge on finding ways to disrupt our industries, these attributes represent a sustainable and attractive path
forward.
Let's turn to slide number 6 to look at customer trends. Over the years, we fielded a variety of questions regarding
the feasibility and long-term prospects of the direct banking model and our ability to diversify our auto platform.
The data and metrics shown over the past 10 years provide a clear indication of the outcomes we've generated.
At Ally Bank, our conviction in a direct bank strategy has never wavered. It has been reinforced by accelerating

consumer preferences for digital products and excellent customer service, both foundational elements of our
platform.
Customer trends in the upper left have grown at a 19% CAGR since 2010. We're seeing steady progress and
deepening relationships ending 3Q at just over 7% of our 2.2 million depositors or customers who also use a
Home or Invest product. And on the bottom, our growth in dealers over the past 10 years has led to a 13% CAGR
in application volume, giving us market visibility and enhancing our ability to meet our return objectives. Moving
forward, we remain focused on being able to continue offering our 8.5 million customers with the innovative
financial products and service levels they've shown an increasing appetite for.
On slide number 7, EPS in the upper left demonstrates the near-term result of our long-term planning and
execution a theme that carries across revenue growth of 4% year-over-year shown in the upper right and deposit
expansion in the bottom left. Tangible book value in the bottom right grew quarter-over-quarter to $34.56 and
adjusting for day-one CECL impact were well above $37 per share reinforcing the intrinsic value of our company.
We're remaining thoughtful in our execution. Our actions continue to be guided by our values, culture and long-
term strategic objectives.
With that Jenn, it's all yours to review the detailed results.

Jennifer LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB. And good morning, everyone. Let's jump in first on some of our key operating metrics. I'll begin on
slide 8 with a review of monthly trends in our auto segment. Consumer application and origination momentum
continued this quarter, reflecting our adaptable business model, dealer resilience and stronger than anticipated
consumer demand. The recovery and sales from the trough in April has been driven by a combination of three
factors, including a shift toward personnel vehicle ownership, replacing mass transit and ridesharing, where usage
has declined 50% to 70% from pre-COVID levels.
The utility provided by owning a car including the added flexibility and control in an uncertain COVID environment
and an increased consumer propensity to purchase a car as spending on entertainment and travel has been
reduced. As these sudden and meaningful consumer shifts have unfolded, we've remained a focused and
dependable partner for our dealers, rapidly expanding our market reach evidenced by the increased loan
purchase program we announced with Carvana last month and the dynamic and evolving support for emerging
and more traditional dealers.
We've continued to be mindful of the credit environment and have managed an effective and dynamic
underwriting approach. In the bottom left used car gain per vehicle averaged over $2,400, the highest level in
seven years leading to the highest quarterly gains in five years. We now expect full year 2020 used car values to
rise by more than 5% year-over-year benefiting NII and net charge-offs.
Moving into 2021, we expect used vehicle values to decline modestly though steady demand and low new vehicle
inventories will continue to be a tailwind longer-term. Commercial balances shown in the bottom right grew in
August and September following the trough in July. As OEM production levels have largely normalized, we expect
balances to slowly rebuild through the latter part of next year.
Let's turn to slide 9 to review consumer product trends, momentum and progress among our digitally based
consumer offerings continued in Q3. Retail deposit balances and customer growth reached their highest third
quarter levels for Ally. Balances expanded despite record tax outflows as payment deadlines were delayed into

Q3. And our customer base expanded every month this quarter, reflecting the appeal of our award winning
offerings. Direct-to-consumer mortgage originations reached $1.3 billion in the quarter. Elevated trading activity
continued at Invest with customer assets ending the quarter at $11.1 billion. Growth in both channels continues to
be sourced from existing customers with 64% of new brokerage account openings and 54% of mortgage
originations coming from existing Ally customers. These metrics reflect our large organic growth opportunity as
customers continue to seek ways to expand their Ally relationships.
Slide 10 includes a snapshot of key balance sheet metrics. We've taken deliberate actions over the past several
years to strengthen our balance sheet, allowing us to focus on executing for our customers in this challenging
environment. Liquidity levels remained strong and our evolving funding profile continues to provide opportunities
to lower our cost of funds and patiently deploy liquidity. Capital levels remained well above regulatory minimums
and reserve levels ensure we're prepared for a variety of potential credit outcomes. While many unknowns remain
around the full extent and ongoing impacts related to COVID, we have confidence in the strength of our balance
sheet and our proven ability to navigate.
Let's move to slide 11 to review detailed financial results for the quarter. Net financing revenue excluding OID of
$1.209 billion grew $146 million linked-quarter and $14 million year-over-year. This represents our highest
quarterly results, and more importantly, resumes our trajectory of NII and NIM expansion powered by the
combination of stable earning asset yields from retail auto yield expansion, lease gains, and a well-positioned
investment security portfolio, declining cost of funds as we continue optimizing the deposit portfolio and reducing
higher cost funding and steady loan growth. These dynamics uniquely position us to overcome headwinds
associated with lower rates, elevated prepayments and negative carry from excess liquidity.
Other revenue of $471 million reflected strong realized investment gains and robust mortgage fee income. Within
this line item is a charge related to the early pay down of certain FHLB debt, an action that reduces excess
liquidity and accelerates NIM as we replaced 2.8% debt with low cost deposits.
Entering 2020, other revenue was projected to generate approximately $400 million per quarter, reflecting
growing insurance, mortgage and SmartAuction results. We've generated meaningfully higher income this year
from strong investment activity, reinforcing our ability to generate diversified revenue. Provision expense of $147
million was materially lower linked-quarter and year-over-year, driven by improved frequency and severity across
consumer portfolios and stable strong commercial performance.
Non-interest expense declined seasonally $80 million quarter-over-quarter and increased $67 million year-over-
year, driven by recurring themes including revenue-related business expenses and volume-driven costs of our
growing customer base, investments in technology-related items and higher insurance expenses, where we
experienced a more active Q3 weather season. We're continuously working to identify and reduce spend across
non-essential areas, while also investing in our businesses to fuel revenue and customer growth. Key metrics at
the bottom reflect a solid performance generated across our company during the quarter.
Slide 12 includes balance sheet and NIM results. Net interest margin excluding OID of 2.67% expanded quarter-
over-quarter, reflecting embedded dynamics I just reviewed, where retail auto portfolio expansion, strong lease
gains and deposit cost improvement drove margin expansion despite NIM pressure from premium amortization
and excess liquidity.
Average earning assets expanded quarter-over-quarter to $180.1 billion, driven by consumer auto and cash,
offsetting the impact of lower commercial balances and elevated mortgage prepayment activity. Retail auto

portfolio yield excluding hedge impacts expanded 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 17 basis points year-
over-year.
Average commercial auto balances declined $4.8 billion quarter-over-quarter though expansion occurred in
August and September. Cost of funds improved 31 basis points, the fifth consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline,
a trend we expect to continue over the next several quarters. These fundamental drivers will propel ongoing NIM
expansion paving a path to 3% as we move through 2021.
Detailed deposit trends are on slide 13. Total deposits grew to $134.9 billion, as retail balances expanded to
$120.8 billion compared to $101.3 billion a year ago. Customer retention measured as those who maintain an
account with us over time remains strong at 96%, demonstrating consistent loyalty and engagement.
On the bottom right, we ended the quarter with over 2.2 million customers growing at the highest level for a third
quarter ever. In the bottom left, retail portfolio rates declined 38 basis points linked-quarter and 88 basis points
year-over-year, reflecting disciplined pricing action and a shift to liquid products and expected trend in a flat rate
environment.
Let's turn to capital on slide 14. Q3 CET1 of 10.4% reflected ongoing earnings growth and a continued pause in
our share repurchase program. Last week, we announced the Q4 common dividend of $0.19 per share payable
on November 13. We are well underway with our CCAR 2020 resubmission and are on track to submit our
revised capital plan in early November. For participating banks, there remains much to be determined by the
Federal Reserve, regarding specific outcomes of this process. But we remain confident in the positioning of our
balance sheet, our robust capital and our proven approach to risk management.
Capital actions over the past five years shown on the bottom, reiterates our disciplined approach to deploying
capital. Shares outstanding have declined 23%, as we repurchased at attractive levels relative to our growing
tangible book value. While we increased the dividend on five separate occasions, these actions occurred as we
grew risk weighted assets, optimized our leading businesses and expanded product offerings. We look forward to
returning to a normalized environment when we can resume dynamic capital deployment.
Turning to slide 15. Credit performance remained strong and better than anticipated, reflecting a combination of
broad-based consumer and commercial resilience and our expertise and dedicated approach within servicing and
collection, including efforts to increase engagement through easy to use digital tools for our customers. The
consolidated net charge off rate of 41 basis points declined 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 42 basis
points year-over-year. In the upper right, net charge-offs of $122 million declined $145 million year-over-year,
driven by retail auto and corporate finance.
In the bottom left, retail auto net charge-offs of 64 basis points improved quarter-over-quarter, a departure from
the typical seasonal trend of rising NCOs through the second half of each year and represent less than half the
prior year level of 1.38%. Delinquency trends remained solid as both 30-plus and 60-plus results ended
meaningfully below prior year levels. We remain encouraged by the performance across our portfolios, including
deferred and non-deferred populations.
Let's turn to slide 16. Given credit results year-to-date, we're lowering our retail auto NCO outlook for full-year
2020 to less than 1.2%. And if trends continue to outperform, we could be closer to 1%. Our consolidated
reserves ended the quarter at $3.4 billion as coverage of 2.87% moved slightly higher quarter-over-quarter.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Retail auto reserves and coverage levels remained stable overall. These levels reflect our balanced approach and
contemplate rising NCOs driven by elevated levels of unemployment and ongoing uncertainty related to COVID
and the economy.
Our current baseline forecast assumes unemployment remains elevated ending 2021 around 7%. Consistent with
prior quarters, we do not include any stimulus related benefits in our reserve modeling. We continue to expect
retail auto losses to peak as we move through 2021 and we believe our current reserve level is sufficient to
absorb this expected increase. Absent significant further deterioration due to the economic outlook, we would not
expect any additional build.
Moving to slide 17, I'll briefly touch on the auto deferral program. As of quarter-end, 99% of COVID deferrals have
expired, 96% of participants have had two or more payments due, and 89% remain current or paid in full. Later
stage performance migration has remained favorable to our expectations and is reflected in our Q3 credit metrics.
In addition to strong consumer trends, we diligently prepared for each stage of the deferral programs, launching
new digital tools that drove higher engagement and payment rates among participants. We are pleased with the
program on many fronts, most notably the support it provided to our borrowers reflective of our customer-first
values.
On slide 18, I'll highlight a few additional metrics in the auto segment. Net financing revenue expanded quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting growth in the retail margin and strong lease gains that more than offset
over $10 billion in lower earning assets driven by inventory levels.
Non-interest expense grew, reflecting the added resources and capabilities deployed within our service and
customer care centers. And as you can see on the bottom right, portfolio yields continue to migrate higher, while
loss content remains strong. Overall execution within auto reflects the resilience of the auto asset class, as well
as our unique ability to adapt and continue to meet the needs of our dealers and customers.
Detailed origination and asset trends are on slide 19. Q3 auto originations of $9.8 billion expanded quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, while average FICO and non-prime levels remained stable. Used volume represented
55% of originations or $5.4 billion, our highest quarterly used volume, reflecting our ability to respond to market
and consumer demand in real-time. In the bottom left, ending consumer assets expanded again in Q3 ending at
$82.9 billion, driven by retail and lease balanced growth. On the bottom right, average commercial assets
declined, though ending balances expanded.
Insurance results are on slide 20. Core pre-tax income of $65 million increased $26 million linked-quarter and was
essentially flat year-over-year. Written premiums of $333 million grew $66 million quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a
rebound in retail F&I activity, more than offsetting lower dealer inventory levels. Trends steadily improved
throughout the quarter, and we expect stabilizing to improving performance as dealer inventories build.
Turning to slide 21, corporate finance pre-tax income of $60 million grew $28 million quarter-over-quarter and $16
million year-over-year, reflecting steady credit performance and asset growth. Unfunded commitments of $3.8
billion reflect our disciplined, but opportunistic approach to growth. While utilization remained lower given the
environment, our ability to lend and generate growth comes amid a challenging backdrop. Portfolio metrics reflect
our prudent approach to risk management. 47% of balances are asset based, 65% of the portfolio has contractual
LIBOR floors, while criticized and non-accrual loans continue to perform well in the current economic backdrop.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
On slide 22, mortgage pre-tax income of $26 million expanded versus prior quarter and prior year as strong gain-
on-sale activity more than offset elevated prepayment-related impacts. Direct-to-consumer originations were solid
as low mortgage rates generated strong refinance activity, which was 63% of our volume in the quarter.
I'll close by reiterating how proud I am of our Ally teammates who remain the driving force behind our accelerating
operating and financial results, as demonstrated in our consistent book value growth and expanding return profile.
We remain focused on doing it right for our customers, communities and shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jenn. I'll wrap up with a few comments on slide number 23. Like Jenn, I want to thank all of our
associates for their tremendous efforts. They continue to give day in and day out, and I've witnessed first-hand
how many of them are juggling a variety of personal and family obligations while working from home, but have
taken on each challenge with a devotion and commitment to do it right.
The significant pressures and strain brought on by COVID and the difficult social issues that have unfolded have
presented challenges beyond anything I've witnessed in my career, but what I've seen in the actions and
response by our people serves as a bright spot and a tremendous source of pride for me in leading this great
company.
For our customers, we will continue to work relentlessly to preserve and grow the trust and loyalty you have in us
as your financial partner no matter what lies ahead, it's who we are. And within our communities, we've stepped
up our actions in recent months to effect positive change in several ways, most publicly with the launch of the Ally
Foundation, a channel that will allow us to quickly and efficiently support the many causes and efforts being
carried out by worthy individuals and organizations today.
Whatever uncertainty and challenge lies ahead of us, I'm confident in our team's ability to continue successfully
navigating on behalf of our customers, which enhances long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, Daniel back to you and it's time for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, Jenn, and good morning, JB.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning, Ryan.

Good morning, Ryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, maybe I'll start, Jenn, you saw a nice bounce back on the margin this quarter to 1Q's level, and now you're
talking about a path to 3%. Can you maybe just talk about some of the drivers to the path? I know you referenced
some of them in the prepared remarks. What's embedded in them, as well as timing?
And also, if we see liquidity come down as dealers pick up, it seems like to me these tailwinds could actually see
us go above 3%. So, I was curious, if you could just give us some color on the numbers, as well as the moving
pieces on the path to 3%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Ryan. Appreciate the question. So, couple of things, this quarter we saw our NIM expand about 25
basis points. And as I had messaged couple of weeks back that was exactly what we are expecting. As we move
forward from here we would expect the NIM to continue to expand likely not quite at that level each quarter, but
we do see a really nice path in Q4 and into 2021 in terms of expanding up to that 3% mark.
Now, in terms of some of the drivers let me hit a few highlights. So, on the asset side, as you can see we've
continued to see our retail auto portfolio yield migrate up and that's as a result of kind of nine trailing quarters of
new origination yields coming on the books at 7%. We were almost at 7% this quarter. So, we'll continue to see
that nice increase in retail auto originations, which should offset some declines because of rates in other areas
and in prepayment. And so, that should stabilize our overall earning asset yield.
Now to your point, there could be some opportunity for that asset yield to even expand, as commercial balances
come back and cash is redeployed in the commercial balances and we continue to grow corporate finance. So, at
a minimum it will be stable.
And then, on the liability side, cost of funds came down over 30 basis points. And we continue to expect – to
continue to see cost of funds come down. OSA rate is at 60 basis points and then you've got CDs over 2%

repricing down below 1%, which creates just this nice tailwind. And then last but not least, we continue to look for
liability management opportunities to further take down cost of funds and you saw we early retired FHLB debt. So,
to your point nice path forward. I think strong dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet. And I'd say at a
minimum we'll be migrating towards that 3% kind of as we enter 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I could do a follow-up, I'll stick with Daniel's guidance. So, just one follow-up. JB, you obviously have
a huge windfall of revenue right now given all these tailwinds that Jenn just referenced on the margin. Can you
maybe just talk about just the magnitude of positive operating leverage you're targeting and what adjusted
efficiency ratio, and potentially what return do you think is doable in this kind of environment. And I'll just tag onto
that. Just given the fact the stock continues to trade below tangible book value, can you maybe just talk about
your willingness to get much more aggressive on returning capital in the coming quarters, before the valuation
potentially expands in a meaningful way. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. You got it right. And obviously we're happy to follow-up with you offline on any of these. Jenn, maybe you
want to start on kind of operating leverage targets things like that. And then maybe I'll take...

...the capital one because obviously that's a complicated question, in light of the Fed, CCAR 2.0 and the
environment. But maybe Jenn you can take the first part.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, so on operating leverage, I just described the path on the NIM, which ties into our path on net
interest income and we're anticipating continued revenue growth from net interest income. On other revenue,
we've seen some outsized opportunity to take market-related gains over the last couple of quarters. We'd expect
that to normalize the debt down to kind of that [ph] 4.25% (00:35:52) level. But overall because of the strength in
NII and continued strong performance in other revenue, we would expect growth there, which to your point, Ryan
is going to drive positive operating leverage, especially if you kind of adjust for some of these outsized gains that
we're seeing in the other revenue line item.
From a return perspective, it's still early as we think about 2021. But we are expecting to get back to kind of pre-
COVID return levels kind of over the next kind of 12 to 18 months assuming that our path on the macros
continues to be accurate. And if anything 2020 has taught us things can move pretty quickly. But based on what
we're seeing right now, we should be able to return to pre-COVID levels here in short order. And then just on
capital return, I know JB want to jump in on this, but priorities remain the same, continue to invest in customer-
related growth. I think the fact that we see a strong earnings path ahead allows us to continue to do that. And then
it will be up to the Fed and kind of CCAR 2.0 to see where we have the ability to start repurchasing shares again.
But JB, I'm sure you want to jump in on that as well.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I mean I'd start with really pleased with the results and pleased Ryan with your recognition of the increasing
pace and kind of inherent strength that's starting to show through the income statement. So, very focused there.
And I think with that provides us a lot of opportunities, as Jenn referenced in her prepared remarks, this concept
of essentialism that's something that we're very focused on inside of Ally. So, really what is it, it's simply the
disciplined pursuit of less. So, I think what we're being very focused on is driving as many efficiencies as possible,
utilizing technology kind of up and throughout the entire corporation, and then using some of those savings to
continue reinvesting in technology and digital tools, and really making us even stronger for the long run.
On capital overall, again, I do think the theme that we talk about at Ally and you're certainly hearing it being
echoed from Chairman, Powell, just the amount of uncertainty that exist. So, I think we've been extraordinarily
pleased with the state of the consumer right now. The consumer is performing incredibly well and obviously that's
showing up in our results. And so, we think there's plenty of numerical reasons to support pretty aggressive and
pretty dynamic capital returns in the immediate future, but you got still ongoing uncertainty with COVID. You don't
understand the full implications if we have a change in the political landscape. And so, all these are dynamics
we're facing. But I think we're just focused on keeping our head down, executing, seeing strong revenue growth
really come through the entire company and that affords us a lot of opportunities and hopefully a lot of
opportunities for our shareholders as well.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. JB you talked about a very strong rebound in originations and the relatively quicker rebound relative to
the previous cycle. I guess, if you – if we peel back the onion a little bit on the trends, how much of this is
sustainable? Can some of this be a pull forward of demand, and when we think about where it's coming from, is it
share gains as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sanjay, thanks. I do think it is fairly sustainable now, obviously $9.8 billion, it's a pretty robust quarter, and I
think as we pointed out it's the highest level that we've seen in five years. But I think there's still opportunities to
see levels remain here or within this relative range, I think as Jenn pointed out you are starting to see a fairly

meaningful shift in the decline in public transportation. I don't think that's necessarily short lived. Maybe it's an
alteration in the environment for the next couple of years, but obviously that affords us a lot of opportunity.
And I think when I go out and talk to dealers and certainly engage with our auto team, I think our expansion into
these alternative channels the Carvana's of the world, the DriveTime's and EchoPark's and other players like that
coupled with the 19,000 franchise dealers that we're touching, it's pretty powerful and our ability to sustain strong
originations.
And I think the other important point is we have been extraordinarily price disciplined. I mean, as Jenn points out,
our 6.95% we'll round it up and call it 7%. I mean this is – we've been very focused on booking high quality
earning asset yields. If we gave up a touch of price we could expand that box and go well north of $10 billion a
quarter in originations. We've just chosen to be very priced disciplined very price focused not chase the super
prime product because you just don't generate all the attractive returns for us that we want to chase. So, for us we
feel really good about our position, we feel really good about where we're playing in the credit environment, and
we think there's more room to run there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up is on credit quality, coupled with sort of returns. Jenn, you mentioned that if
the trends continue you could be 1% for the fourth quarter into the year. I guess if we marry that, maybe what are
the swing factors there? How comfortable do you feel about credit? I see the deferral trends look really favorable.
But then, if you couple that with the NIM discussion before as we look into 2021, I mean shouldn't the returns
actually be higher than what you were expecting going forward. Because I don't know that we've seen 3% NIMs in
the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Appreciate the question, Sanjay. And I think a lot comes back around credit and the ultimate path around
delinquencies and NCOs. And I think what we're observing and the industry is observing at large is just a
disconnect between the macroeconomic factors and delinquency trends. And so, while we're incredibly pleased
with the performance year-to-date and Q4 is shaping up to be strong, we also want to be mindful of the
environment that we're in. And what the ultimate path does look like, how the path of COVID and the economy
shapes up and so, I think at this point we're just being really cautious around that. I would like to reiterate as well
that while we could see kind of 1% or less than 1.2% for full year 2020, we do have a retail auto reserve that's
four times that.
So, just from a income statement perspective we should have taken notice of the payment. And we did that in the
first quarter. So, we did it early, we did it at large and we're going to just continue to be mindful of the
environment. But absolutely if performance continues like this, if delinquency rates continue to trail kind of 30-
plus, down 100 basis points then that credit loss could get pushed out kind of mid-2021 or beyond. And that
obviously would impact our returns.
But I think as I described just a couple of minutes ago, I think the fundamental drivers of our returns are very solid
from NIM perspective, NII growth continuing to see other revenue continue to be strong maybe not quite at these
levels, but strong. And to your point, we do see a really attractive path on expanding returns, which we've been
talking about for some time now, Sanjay.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. Just a question on your partner relationships here, I noticed there and you highlighted that you've upped your
commitments to [ph] the room (44:32) in Carvana, how has those opportunities evolved as we've kind of gone
through 2020 and gotten into this new paradigm? And what effect do those changes and evolutions have on your
partnership strategy more broadly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Rob, appreciate the question. I would say, our partnerships with some of the newer entrants are very
similar to what we have more broadly across auto and supporting all of our dealers, which we want to be there for
them in all environments and we want to be opportunistic. I think what has been a big win for us here in 2020 is
just the growth in some of these new dealers and we've been able to grow with our partners' growth.
We had kind of record level of inflows and retail auto flows this quarter from those new partnerships. So, we're
going to continue to support all of our dealers. Our strategy has been around increasing application reach. You
can see that in some of the customer metrics, JB shared, applications continue to grow at a 13% CAGR. And we
feel good about our positioning in – across the board and our dealers.

And the other thing I'd say, and JB talked a lot about this, is just the modernization of auto continues. You see
consumer shift to more digital purchasing behaviors. And because we have the partnerships that you just
mentioned, we're able to shift with changing dynamics across consumer preferences as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Got it. Got it. Then just a quick one on capital and capital return. 10.4% CET1 right now, that's obviously a little
lower with the CECL adjustment. Do you have one eye on that fully phased-in CECL capital level when you're
thinking about capital return or is it little too early to be thinking about that yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Oh, no. We're always thinking about that, yeah, we think about that all day. But I think the headlines around
capital, one, we feel great about the position where – these are the highest capital levels we've had in history
where some kind of $3.3 billion above our implied CET1 requirement from the SCB. And you couple that with the
rest of the balance sheet with the $3.4 billion reserve and we feel like we are in a really strong position across the
balance sheet.
And then, as we move forward, as we were just talking about, we see a strong path on earnings growth. And so
the question now is where do we deploy the growing capital from earnings and it'll follow kind of the same path
that we've been talking about. Customer growth is number one. We'd expect RWA to pick up as commercial
balances pick up, that's probably the most obvious driver of capital deployment. We continue to see growth
across every one of our businesses, whether that's our Ally Lending business, corporate finance, DTC mortgage,
consumer auto, as well as the commercial side, and so that would be kind of path two. And then I think JB
summarized it really well, we would like to move into a more normalized situation when it comes to repurchases,
especially with where our stock is trading relative to very strong book value growth.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:48:41).
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, my question here is one that I know I'm going to get from investors, which is around the sustainability, and I
think, Jenn, earlier in your prepared remarks you highlighted how you do anticipate to see some steady demand
going into 2021. I'm wondering if you could give us some color, some comments that can support that just to give
people some understanding of why you think some of these tailwinds are going to continue for at least several
more quarters here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And we appreciate the question and anticipated it, which is why we added page 5 to our earnings
material today, which is just about the positioning of our businesses. And if you start first on the auto side, auto
continues to be a really strong performing asset class throughout 2020, and it's where we play in kind of the prime
segment, but it's really across the board and super prime as well. And you're just seeing strength across the
board.
And then when you look at where we sit in the industry with our scale, with the breadth of products that we offer,
with the partnerships we just touched on, we feel really well-positioned to continue to see that outflow grow.
We've closed the gap on a year-over-year basis. We had record used application flow. And so, just the positioning
of our model where we can take advantage of unique pockets within a growing and strong asset class, we
absolutely see sustainability there.
And for full year 2020, we're likely to be pretty darn close to where we were last year from origination perspective
and pretty close to that 7% yield, which remains at kind of record levels to the underlying benchmark. So, great
flows, great sustained pricing within auto. And again, we don't see any sign of that stopping just yet and aren't
anticipating that stopping.
And then, on the consumer side, you just think about the shift in banking around digitization and we're already
there. We're kind of 100% digital. You see the flows that we have this strong retention on the deposit side, and
we've done that with record declines in pricing. So, we feel really well-positioned to meet the needs of our
consumers and deposits. And then continuing the theme of digitization that's where you see Ally Invest and also
our DTC mortgage products picking up and they're able to kind of draft off of the strong performance that we've
had on the deposit side. So, feel really, really good about all of our businesses in this environment. And we added
that customer slide as well because not only are we positioning ourselves well from a product perspective, but
we're seeing that customer growth that we can continue to harvest over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A

And that is showing up in the scale that we are seeing in our new businesses.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah. No, that's helpful, so more legs to the stool and penetrating client base successfully. So, I get that.
Thanks for the color. On – one other question on the capital return for you and JB is around the SCB, so the
question I got from somebody the other day was, does the SCB change how flexible and nimble you can be? Is
there a change in the buyback capability that the SCB gives you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I mean, let me first start with the SCB, the rate, and then just that the guidance that we've received
around the SCB. So, first of all, it implies kind of a required CET1 of 8% we already managed the company at 9%.
So, there's really no change there in terms of how we think about overall capital levels. And then, at least how
they originally position the SCB it should actually give us more flexibility...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
...because as long as we're managing capital deployment above that 8% we should be able to really dynamic –
more dynamically deploy our capital as we move through the quarter. So, if anything, Betsy it should be a net
positive, just in terms of timing and magnitude of capital deployment.
But as JB, I think highlighted very well, there's still a lot of questions around how the FRB will respond to CCAR
2.0 and we think we're well-prepared for that, but we're mindful about there is still some uncertainty there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

You too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I think the – to me the most interesting
part of the quarter has been you know the – what you had predicted after Q2 of PPNR improvement has certainly
happened. And I think you alluded to the ability to kind of continue to optimize your – the right hand side of your
balance sheet. And maybe if you could spend just a minute or two on how much room you think there is both in
terms of deposits replacing other liabilities as your balance sheet kind of normalizes in size, and also kind of
deposit pricing. I think you lagged a little bit your peers at the beginning of this downward trend and are starting to
catch-up now, so maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And I appreciate that Moshe. And we're optimizing both sides of the balance sheet, and I think steady
earning asset yields are really important. But on the liability side, you're absolutely right. We have a wide variety
of opportunities to continue to optimize and the most obvious and impactful one is on the deposits. We you know
– take OSA, we dropped OSA rates 50 basis points this quarter down to 60 basis points, and that was kind of in
record time, if you look at great financial crisis it took some 35, 36 months to get to this point and the industry kind
of came down in a couple of months. So, just very accelerated decline in OSA rates, and so you'll see that roll
forward from partial year to full year, as we head into 2021, and then you also CDs repricing down, so CDs will
reprice from over 2% down to less than 1%, so that creates a nice tailwind for us.
And then, as we've continued to see flows we can start – continue to replace some of the broker deposits with
retail deposits. And if you look kind of a year ago broker deposits were about 15% of our deposit stack that's down
to 10%, so we'll continue to let that flow.
And then in terms of the other liabilities, unsecured, we had about $2.2 billion in unsecured roll off in 2020. We'll
keep kind of the volume the same, but the rate will be better. So, we'll be bringing down cost of unsecured, get a
little bit less of an impact in 2021. But we'll have a nice roll forward there.
And then in terms of other liabilities you saw exactly, I pointed out the FHLB early retirement, we're going to
continue to look for ways to take down some of this more expensive debt because of this really strong tailwind we
have from both deposit flows and pricing. And then last, but not least it just – it gives us such a strategic
advantage because while we have this cash we can use that excess cash to replace higher cost liabilities. And
we're not forced to kind of invest into putting duration in our security portfolio less than 1%, so we feel just really
great about dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet and the ability to continue to optimize liabilities, take
down that funding cost for several quarters to come.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks. And I certainly didn't mean to minimize the impact of pricing on the asset side. But I – the follow up
I wanted to ask was about – you mentioned kind of in passing that you're expecting plus 5% used car values this
year. And I think that kind of had been minus 3% to 5% in the past. And could you just [indiscernible] (00:57:27) a

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
little bit about how that might have impacts going into 2021 given where used car values I mean which are
probably up in actual terms 15%, they may not sustain that, but they're up substantially higher than that as of now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And if – maybe I'll just dial it back to kind of late 2019 and heading into 2020. If you look at off-lease supply,
we were hitting a peak here in 2020, simply because of supply side dynamics. We were expecting to see a kind of
3% to 5% decline in overall used vehicle value this year.
Now, 2020 has really shaken everything up kind of across the industry, we saw precipitous drop in the second
quarter as auction lanes kind of dried up. But as the auto asset class has continued to remain strong, consumer
demand for vehicles COVID-related has continued to accelerate. And new vehicle inventories are at you know
kind of nine year lows down 27% year-over-year. We're just seeing demand for used spike up kind of to
unprecedented levels. We're in the mid-teens here in Q3 and that's expected, Moshe to continue into Q4 and be
strong quite frankly in the first half of 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Now at some point, we do expect this to normalize a bit. And so while we're expecting overall 2020 used vehicle
pricing to come about – up about 5%, we do think it'll normalize down a couple percentage points heading into
2021, with strength in the first half and some pressures in the last half.
But I will say bigger picture that off-lease inventory does start to come down heading into 2022. So there could be
some sustained tailwinds kind of over the next 12 to 18 months simply because of that. And I mentioned there are
$2,400 in kind of gain per vehicle, and that's predominantly in the SUV and truck category, which continues to be
in high demand across our consumers. Some of the other categories, the small cars and smaller vehicles don't
have quite the gains that we've seen in our book.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hey Bill. Good morning.

Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hi Bill.

Hi. So, we clearly see the benefit in your numbers as you guys have leaned into used and more of your [ph]
business as we mix there (01:00:05). How high would you be comfortable letting that used versus new mix get? Is
there any reason not to let it get too high? And then could you also maybe give some color on the relative
difference in profitability of new versus used just at a high level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. So Bill, we don't have any cap on used, I mean used has really strong risk adjusted returns. We're
very comfortable managing the credit risk. We know how to price it. We have no cap there. So, we'll just continue
to be opportunistic across new and used, and we'll let the numbers play out.
In terms of profitability, I think I've shared in the past that the pricing on a used vehicle tends to be kind of 150
basis points higher than a new vehicle and the delta on credit risk tends to be just 20 basis points, 30 basis points
or so. So, you can kind of do the math around that, but we absolutely get paid kind of 3, 4 times the increase in
credit risk and the yield that we see on the used car front. And in this environment with used vehicles values
continuing to outperform that return only gets a bit higher.

Got it. Very helpful, thank you. And as a follow-up if I may. Can you go a little bit deeper into your outlook for a
dealer floor plan lending, any constraints on the production side there still? And when – a little bit more on
perhaps when balanced growth could start to resume there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean the OEMs are back into kind of full speed ahead production. I think they're about 100%
manufacturing levels as they were pre-COVID. I think what's driving this slower build in terms of inventories has
just been very strong pent up and – very strong demand. Again, going back to auto continues to be an asset class
winner in this environment. So, as quick as they're manufacturing the cars they're kind of getting sold off a lot. So,
what we've seen is kind of a trough here in July and then we've picked up about $1 billion in August and
September, continuing to see it slowly come back, but though we wouldn't expect to be back to pre-COVID levels
in our floor plan book until late 2021.
