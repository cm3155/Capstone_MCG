Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Although our beloved Buccaneers were slow out of the gate last
Sunday against some very strong competition, not so for Raymond James as we are off to a fantastic start. It's
hard to believe the pandemic started in the US nearly two years ago. When I think back on all of that's been
accomplished since then, I'm so proud of the way our associates and advisors have continue to serve their clients
with great care and compassion, living out our values each and every day.
Beginning on slide 4, our steadfast commitment to serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the
quarter, starting off fiscal 2022 with record quarterly revenues and earnings that were propelled by record
investment banking revenues, and record asset management and related administrative fees in the Private Client
Group.
In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.8 billion and record net income of $446
million or earnings per diluted share of $2.10, a 42% increase over diluted EPS in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
Excluding $6 million of acquisition related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $451 million or earnings
per diluted share of $2.12. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.2% and adjusted annualized return
on tangible common equity was 23.7%, a very impressive result, especially in this near zero rate environment and
given our strong capital positions.
Moving to slide 5, we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.26 trillion, up
23% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $678
billion, up 8% sequentially, record clients' domestic cash sweep balances of $73.5 billion, and record financial
assets under management of $203 billion.
Through our client-focused culture and leading technology solutions, we maintain our focus on supporting
advisors and their clients. As a result, we continue to see strong results in terms of advisor retention, as well as
record results in recruiting new advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.
Over the trailing 12-month period ending in December 31, 2021, we recruited financial advisors with nearly $350
million of trailing 12 production and approximately $56 billion of client assets to our domestic independent
contractor and employee channels. Additionally, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of approximately
$104 billion over the four quarters ending in December 31, 2021, representing more than 11% of domestic PCG
assets at the beginning of the period.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
First quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was even stronger, generating a nearly 14% annualized rate,
the highest level we have experienced since starting to closely track this metric. These results really highlight our
industry leading organic growth. We ended the quarter with 8,464 financial advisors, a net increase of 231 over
the prior year period and a net decrease of 18 compared to the preceding quarter.
As many of you know, in the last calendar quarter, we generally see an elevated number of retirements and
advisors choosing to leave the business. And it was no different this year with approximately 90 advisors falling
into that category. However, when advisors retire, they typically have succession plans and assets are usually
retained by the firm. So, there is minimal impact to the production or asset levels.
Clients' domestic cash sweep balances grew 10% sequentially to a record $73.5 billion. As Paul will detail later in
the call, we should have significant upside to our pre-tax earnings in a rising interest rate environment. Also worth
noting on this slide is the impressive loan growth at the Raymond James Bank during the quarter, up 5%
sequentially to a record $26 billion. This growth was driven by securities based loans to PCG clients as well as a
strong corporate loan growth.
Moving to the segment results on slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of
$1.84 billion and pre-tax income of $195 million. Given the timing of certain expenses, we think it is most
appropriate to compare the year-over-year results where the segment's revenues increased 25% and the pre-tax
income increased 39% over the first fiscal quarter of 2021, a truly fantastic growth.
The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $614 million and record pre-tax income
of $201 million, representing an impressive 33% pre-tax margin to net revenues. These record results were driven
by record investment banking revenues, including records for both M&A and equity underwriting. Fixed income
also generated solid results for the quarter.
The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $236 million and pre-tax income of $107 million. On
a year-over-year basis, the revenues grew 21% and pre-tax income grew 29% over the first fiscal quarter of 2021,
primarily driven by higher assets under management. Paul will discuss some of the sequential variances in the
segment later on the call.
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $183 million and pre-tax income of $102 million,
representing solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Net revenue growth was largely due to higher asset
balances as the bank generated attractive growth in its securities-based lending portfolio, up an astonishing 44%
over December of 2020 in addition to the growth in the residential mortgages and corporate loans.
Pre-tax income growth was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and a bank loan loss release in the current
quarter compared to a provision for credit losses in the comparative periods as macroeconomic conditions
continue to improve. These record results reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
Before I hand the call over to Paul, I'll take a moment to highlight the completion of the acquisition of the UK-
based Charles Stanley Group earlier this month. Charles Stanley adds approximately $36 billion of client assets,
bringing Raymond James total client assets to the UK to approximately $57 billion. We have long admired this
firm, and we are pleased to welcome Charles Stanley to the Raymond James family.
And now, for a more detailed review of our first quarter financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry.

Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 8. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.78 billion grew
25% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Record asset management fees grew 1% over the preceding quarter.
I do want to touch on the 1% sequential decline of asset management fees in the Asset Management segment
during the quarter, primarily due to a larger portion of certain client fees allocated to the Private Client Group
segment starting at the beginning of the fiscal year, which effectively resulted in nearly $9 million of managed
account fees that shifted from the Asset Management segment to the Private Client Group segment during the
quarter. This change is the primary driver of the Asset Management segment's revenues and pre-tax income
declining sequentially.
Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts were up 8% during the first fiscal quarter, providing a nice
tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. But there are fewer days in the fiscal second
quarter, so I expect somewhere around 5% to 6% sequential growth in this line item in the second quarter.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $558 million grew 6% over the prior year and 3% sequentially with 12%
year-over-year growth in the Private Client Group segment and sequential growth in the Private Client Group
segment and the Capital Markets segment. Account and service fees of $177 million increased 22% year-over-
year and 4% sequentially, largely due to higher mutual fund and annuity service fees, as well as client account
fees in the Private Client Group segment.
Paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter, so I'll touch on Other revenues. Other
revenues of $51 million were down 31% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to lower tax credit
funds revenues, which are typically highest in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gains on private equity investments also
declined on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
Moving to slide 9, clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $73.5 billion, up 10% over
the preceding quarter and representing 6.5% of domestic PCG client assets. This growth in client cash balances
should bode well for us in a rising interest rate environment, which I will describe in more detail on the next slide.
Turning to slide 10. Combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks was $205 million, up
3.5% from the preceding quarter. This growth is largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net
interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which held flat at 1.92% for the quarter. Average yields on the bank
loan portfolio actually increased slightly this quarter, which was fantastic to see. However, an increase in lower
yielding cash balances kept the bank's net interest margin flat.
We expect the bank's NIM to remain relatively stable at current interest rates, and we expect a nice tailwind for
net interest income going into the next quarter given the strong growth of loans at Raymond James Bank. But net
interest income will also be impacted by fewer days in the fiscal second quarter. Related to loans, based on your
feedback, we have added ending period loan balances by category in our supplemental earning schedule. We
hope you find this update helpful and as always, thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our
disclosures.
The average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks tick lower to 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting
the low interest rate environment and a limited demand for cash from third-party banks. I want to provide an
update to the interest rate sensitivity from what we provided last May during our Analyst and Investor Day.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
As of December 31, clients' domestic cash sweep balances were $73.5 billion. Given our high concentration of
floating rate assets that are funded with these cash balances, we should have significant upside from increases in
short-term interest rates. Using these static balances and an instantaneous 100-basis point increase in short-term
interest rates, we would expect incremental pre-tax income of approximately $570 million per year, with
approximately 65% of that reflected as net interest income and 35% reflected as account and service fees. This
scenario assumes a blended deposit beta of around 15% for the first 100-basis point increase, commensurate
with what we experienced in the last rate cycle.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 11. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio
for the quarter of 67.7% was well-below our 70% target and close to the compensation ratio we achieved in fiscal
2021, helped by record investment banking revenues. As explained on the prior calls, while our compensation
ratio target is 70% or lower in this near zero short-term interest rate environment, we have demonstrated we can
manage below that target closer to 67% to 68% when the Capital Markets segment generates at or near these
record levels of revenues. And, of course, we'll likely have to revisit this target if interest rates start increasing.
Non-compensation expenses of $339 million decreased 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the bank loan loss
reserve release this quarter, as well as lower professional fees. As you can see in these results, we have been
very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non-compensation related expenses while
still investing in growth and ensuring very high service levels for advisors and their clients.
However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect expenses to increase throughout this fiscal year as we
continue investing in people and technology to support our tremendous growth as business development
expenses increase with travel and conferences resuming, and as net loan growth drives higher associated bank
loan loss provisions for credit losses. For example, you can see our communications and information processing
expenses increased 13% year-over-year as we continue to make critical investments in technology. We would
expect the year-over-year growth for this line item to be right around this level for the full year in fiscal 2022.
Slide 12 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. While our pre-tax margin target in this near
zero short-term interest rate environment is around 16%, we've generated a pre-tax margin of 20.1% in the fiscal
first quarter or 20.3% on an adjusted basis, boosted by record revenues particularly for investment banking, still
relatively subdued business development expenses, and the loan loss release during the quarter.
We will probably have to revisit our pre-tax margin and compensation ratio target at our Analyst and Investor Day
scheduled in May if we start seeing increases in short-term interest rates. Hopefully by then, we will also have
more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for investment banking revenues, the level of
business development expenses, travel and conferences resume more fully, and the impact of recently closed
and pending acquisition.
On slide 13, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $68.5 billion, an 11% sequential increase,
reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances
that we're accommodating on the balance sheet. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at
the parent ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, increasing 21% during the quarter. The total capital ratio of 26.9%
and the Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.1% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well-
capitalized, providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In December, the board of
directors increased the quarterly dividend 31% to $0.34 per share per quarter, which is not reflected on this chart

until next quarter. The board also authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion, which replaced the previous
authorization.
As of January 25, 2022, all $1 billion remained available under this authorization. Due to regulatory restrictions
following our pending acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares
until after closing, but we believe this authorization signals our intention to repurchase the associated shares soon
after closing. In the meantime, we expect our capital and our share count to continue growing between now and
closing.
Lastly, on slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan
portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans declined and non-performing
assets remained low at just 19 basis points. The bank loan loss reserve release of $11 million was primarily
driven by improving macroeconomic assumptions used in the CECL models. The bank loan allowance for credit
losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined from 1.27% in the preceding quarter to 1.18% at
quarter end. For corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.13%.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2022. We are well-positioned
entering the second fiscal quarter with strong capital ratios, records for all our key business metrics, including
client assets, client domestic cash sweep balances and strong activity level for the financial advisor recruiting and
investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with an 8%
sequential increase of assets in fee-based account, which should result in a 5% to 6% increase in asset
management fees given two fewer days in the second quarter. Additionally, based on our robust recruiting
pipelines, we hope to continue our recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused
values and leading technology platforms.
I can't promise we'll be able to sustain the 11% net new asset growth we achieved over the last 12 months or the
phenomenal 14% annualized net new assets we experienced in the fiscal first quarter. But given our strong
retention and continued interest in all of our affiliation options, I'm optimistic we will continue delivering leading
organic growth numbers.
In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong for the next quarter or two.
But given all the uncertainties in the market, we really don't have much visibility for the second half of the year at
this point. We do know we have a much stronger team than we had five years ago, and we have gained market
share. So our productive capacity has certainly grown. But what I can't tell you is what will happen to the markets
and activity levels across the industry 6 to 12 months from now.
We also expect solid fixed income brokerage results over the next quarter or two, driven by demand from
depository client segment, which is still flush with cash, and searching for yield optimization opportunities that we
do a fantastic job in helping our clients.
In the Asset Management segment, as equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively
impacted by the higher financial assets under management, which continues to be driven by the strong growth of

assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment. And Raymond James Bank should continue to
grow as we'll have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.
We will continue to focus on lending to the Private Client Group segment through securities-based loans and
mortgages, and we will remain selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan portfolio. Also, as previously
mentioned, we should experience significant tailwinds in a rising interest rate environment.
Finally, I want to thank all our advisors and our associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing
excellent service to their clients. These results are a testament to their hard work and everyone in the Raymond
James family.
With that, operator, will you please open up the line for questions?

Manan Gosalia Q

Hey. So, I was wondering if you can unpack your comments on the net interest income and the sensitivity to
higher rates. I know you said $570 million addition to pre-tax income, 65% NII, 35% account and service fees. But
does that assume a flat balance sheet and CIB balances staying flat and also third-party deposits staying flat? Or
– so, is there basically more upside to these numbers given the loan growth that you're generating and also the
upcoming acquisition of TriState?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, you're absolutely right. That is a static analysis based on current balances. And so we do have upside going
forward as we continue growing the balance sheet at Raymond James Bank and also as we hopefully close the
TriState Capital acquisition. So, we have some good tailwinds in a rising rate environment.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. So, then maybe I can push a little bit on your pre-tax margin comments. I know you're not giving any
targets right now, but maybe you can help us think through it. So, if I look at your quarter right now, you're running
at a 20% pre-tax margin. If I normalize for provisions and business development cost, maybe you get to 19%. And
then if Capital Markets' revenue is elevated maybe that gets you down to 18% when those normalized.
And your comment of $570 million, if I'm doing the math right, suggest there's 3 percentage points to 4
percentage points upside to the margin. So, should we expect that as we get through this rate hike cycle, your
margin can go up to 21%, 22% in this cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we're not ready to come out with a new target at this juncture but – because as you point out, there
are a lot of moving parts. But you are correct that the $570 million on today's revenues would equate to
somewhere around 300 basis points to 400 basis points of benefit, but I think the – some of the other factors that
we have to consider is sort of normalized business development, what Capital Markets' revenues look like going
forward.
So, there are some other puts and takes and variables to consider as we get more clarity. But with that being
said, if you look at where we were in the last rate cycle, we had higher a pre-tax margin target before rates were
cut to zero. And so, we obviously have upside and tailwinds from higher rates.

So, I wanted to start off with just a question on TriState Capital. At the time of the merger, you had guided Paul to
about 8% accretion from the deal. And if memory serves that only assumed two rate hikes through 2024. That
assumption certainly feels conservative given the forward curve reflecting close to eight hikes exiting 2023. And I
was hoping you could just provide some updated expectations for TSC accretion or the incremental sensitivity if
we do get additional rate hikes.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
And then just speak to your philosophy around how much of that NII windfall from higher rates would you expect
to fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested in the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, as far as the synergy guidance that we provided upon announcement that – if my memory serves
me correctly, I think it was 8 percentage – 8% accretion, not really factoring in any rate hikes at all and then
maybe an additional 300 basis points to 400 basis points with the rate projections that you just mentioned.
So, to your point, the rate increases are – look like they're coming faster than we anticipated at that point in time.
So, to the extent they have a floating – highly floating rate balance sheet locked in securities based loans, 65% of
their loans are in securities based loans that are floating. And so, to your point, there is more upside if rates
increase faster than we originally anticipated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's great color, Paul. And just for my follow-up and it'll a bit of a pointed question on organic growth. I
mean, your headline organic growth is the highest of any of the public companies that have reported so far. That's
coming in at an impressive 11% trailing 12 months, 14% annualized in the quarter. At the same time, the reported
AUM, when we go through the benchmarking exercise, the growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter is virtually identical to
peers that are growing at half your stated organic growth rate.
And it just also appears a little bit light relative to the gains that we saw in the S&P of about 10% in the quarter.
And I was hoping you could just speak to the stronger organic growth, why it's not necessarily translating into a
higher level of AUM growth granted one quarter does not a trend make and any differences you're just aware of in
terms of how you run the organic growth calculation relative to what some of your peers might be doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. As far as we can tell, Steve, we are calculating – most of the peers are calculating the organic growth
calculation similarly. We track that pretty closely. So, we have been generating, as you said, leading organic
growth if you look at our net new asset metrics. And if you look at our asset growth over time, which we've been
saying for a very long time even before we started producing net new assets, our asset growth is the best in the
industry as well. And as you point out, those two are correlated.
So from quarter-to-quarter, sometimes it's hard to tell. But if you look at it over one, three, five-year period or any
period of time, our asset growth on an organic basis has been leading in the industry. Sometimes, you have to
factor in acquisitions or big program hires or something like this, but certainly the net new asset and the asset
growth has been amongst the best. And in certain quarters, the best; certain years, the best in the industry.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Want to come back on the interest rate outlook and some of the moving parts here. If we look at the cash
balances, you saw a really nice step up in the quarter and big spike in December as well. I'm just curious, was
that just kind of year end selling or was it because of the strong M&A or some seasonality? I know there can
sometimes be some seasonality in there. So, really just trying to understand like how sticky you think that kind of
step function [ph] higher (00:32:22) was in the quarter.
And then also in terms of deposit betas, you absolutely have some good recent history of how things trended and
it was quite a bit better than, I think, expectations heading into the prior tightening cycle. How are you guys
thinking about maybe competitive threats or just competitive dynamics with fintech being a lot larger today than it
was four or five years ago, and many of those firms are kind of signaling that they're going to pass the majority of
the benefit through to customers? Does that play in or do you not look at them necessarily as direct competitors
when you're thinking about cash and deposit rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good question. Devin, I think there's a few things. First, you have to remember, client cash is only 6.5% of assets,
so it's not a high percentage. Typically for most periods, we're closer to 10%. So, clients are still pretty invested.
So, part of that with the market growth, obviously, the equities grow versus the cash. But – so, the client cash has
been very sticky in terms of the portfolio, certainly, not overweighted, but also because of our recruiting. We bring
a lot of cash in. When people move over, their clients are allocated somewhere 5% to 10% cash, so that
continues to grow. And our recruiting is just doing great. We're still full guns on it.
So, I think that's – we're pretty comfortable with that cash. I think it's almost the opposite. If there's a correction
during this interest rate period, we see a lot more cash generated. But we haven't seen any unusual movements.
So, as a percent of asset, still pretty low, probably driven more with us by just our success in recruiting.

Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. As far as your deposit beta question, there are more fintechs now than there were three years ago, but
there are a lot of high yield accounts available online three years ago as well. Yeah. So, maybe offsetting factor is
that unlike the last rate cycle, the banking system is extremely flush with cash now, maybe more so. Well,
definitely, more so than it was in the last rate cycle.

So, there's some puts and takes. We are assuming in our $570-million pre-tax upside 15% deposit beta, which is
commensurate with what we saw on the last rate cycle. We think that's conservative, but it could be lower or
higher than that for the first hundred basis points depending on those factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We find clients typically during these increases. If we go through history that – it's got to be over 1% base rate
before they can start looking at it. So, we have a long way to go from 1 basis point, certainly, and the early going
is in – fintechs can offer one, but there's not really many place to park them very liquidly at that rate.
So, I don't think – I think the first hundred basis points is a pretty safe assumption, probably conservative given
the history on the first hundred basis points. And after that as rates go higher, then there is – the game is on. But I
think the early raise is a pretty safe assumption.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yes. Okay. Terrific. That all makes sense. So just to follow up here with Charles Stanley closed, maybe if you can
just talk a little bit more about plans to accelerate growth and investments and kind of the UK wealth management
platform. I know it's still very small, but how we should just think about kind of the trajectory there and maybe your
enthusiasm for the potential for additional growth outside the US.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think that – it's just closed a few days now. So, we're just really starting to talk about integration and
that takes some time. But it's a great franchise. If it was constrained, it was constrained by capital a little bit,
family-controlled, and for a good reason they didn't want to dilute their position where they were. So, I think those
are off because we have plenty of capital to fuel it.
And, generally, when people join you, the first thing we always focus on is retention. And we've had a pretty good
track record. I think that'll be very positive there, too. And we need to get everybody settled down in the seat
positive of the story. I will tell you that I've – of all the ones we've ever done and we have TriState still pending but
who has a great cultural fit, this is the – we're hearing very little noise from the advisors. They think it makes
sense and they think it's good for them we will invest. We do have some technology that they can use some of the
other things.
So – but it's going to take a good year or so to really get through that integration. But we would expect where we
have one of the leading growth firms in the UK with RJIS, our independent, we think that we can really step up the
growth as is Charles Stanley management with the capital and, the ability to recruit in the story. So, we're
confident, but I wouldn't expect anything significant this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Great. If I can just squeeze one more in here just on the administrative and incentive comp kind of
trajectory. How should we think about that relative to revenue growth across the business? Meaning, is there
some leverage there or is revenues potentially continue to accelerate that that will track ahead? Just trying think
about some of the puts and takes there.

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, no. Devin, as you know, we are always focused on trying to realize operating leverage in the business and
growing revenues faster than expenses. And there's always noise quarter to quarter, especially when you're
comparing a fiscal year-end quarter with the beginning of the fiscal year on a linked basis. But if you step back, in
fiscal 2021 in the PCG business, we grew the administrative and incentive comp by 5%, but with revenues in that
business growing 19%.
So, that was really significant operating leverage. And that's kind of continuing in this quarter with 25% year-over-
year growth in revenues versus 14% year-over-year growth in administrative compensation expense. So, to your
point, we have always been focused and we're still focused on realizing that operating leverage as revenue
grows.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just to follow up on the compensation question for the – if I look at FA payouts
as a percent of compensable revenue, it seems like it went up year-over-year. I know that can move around. But
just – is there any kind of pressure on compensation given just competition or salary wage inflation or is that just
bouncing around? But it just seemed like it went up about 90 basis points year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The financial adviser payouts are on the grid and so – in the employee channel and both in the
independent contractor channel. So, as you noted, that does tend to bounce around 25 basis points, 50 basis
points from any quarter when you're comparing it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There are benefits that are
accrued in there and other things. It's not just direct payout that you would see on the grid. So, it can bounce
around from quarter to quarter, but we're not expecting a meaningful step up based on the mix of advisors we
have in our independent and employee channel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We have not changed, really. We haven't raised the payouts, and there are higher payouts and higher
production for some so you get a little bit of that impact. But it's really, I think, just more of a bouncing around
effect than it is any change here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Okay. So, no change in the grid. Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe on the TSC deal, as you get closer to it, do
you feel like there's an opportunity to really invest to expand that more rapidly? Should we expect some

investment spending around that business? Or is it really just, hey, stand-alone, we think they can grow with just a
little more incremental capital, don't need a ton of investment spend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think they're – if you look at their own releases, we don't – we're still in the middle of the shareholder –
they had a very, very good – they have very good growth. And, yeah, I think what you'll see is us just giving them
a little more capital and maybe to accelerate technology and to help serve their clients. And we may get some
synergies over time on compliance and those kind of functions. But outside of that, they'll be operating alone.
They'll have a little more capital and their growth rates are very good. We're kind of very pleased historically and
their current release was very, very good.
So, we certainly don't need them growing faster than they are. I mean, they're growing well, and I think it's going
to be more of our balance sheet deployment, the use of our cash, and they're going to do their thing and serve
their clients, so.

William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. So, just picking up on TSC. So, I appreciate the
upside with the higher rates. But then, they did have a strong fourth quarter for we could tell as well. How does
the fourth quarter trend relative to your baseline accretion of 8% as you sort of think about when this closes? And
any update on when you think the deal itself may close?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We kind of gave you some assumptions when we announced the transaction. We use conservative
assumptions when we do any kind of investment or make any kind of investment, and certainly the level of growth
that they've achieved in the fourth quarter – again, they're a separate public company, so I don't want to speak
about their results. But to your point, I don't think you would call those conservative. I mean, they've been
generating really strong growth. And so, I'll just leave it at that.
In terms of timing, it's all contingent on regulatory approvals. And so, we hope to get it done in calendar 2022. But,
again, that's dependent on the regulatory approvals and right now...

William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. Just as a follow-up, coming back to business development for a moment. Any update on how you're
thinking about sort of the glide path in fiscal 2022 and so that endpoint number of $200 million is sort of the exit
this year relative to what you sort of guided to last quarter? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I wouldn't say the $200-million was a guide. It was just a reference point for where we were pre-COVID.
That would have been $50 million a quarter. We are right around $35 million this quarter, and we actually were
able to have an advisor conference this quarter for the employee channel.
So, I would be very surprised – most of the things here in the second quarter we've postponed and pushed back
unfortunately due to the COVID spread. I would be very surprised if we are able to even exit the year at the $50-
million run rate per quarter, unfortunately. And I say unfortunately because we really do want to get back to
traveling again, to having the advisor recognition trips and the conferences. So, I think that's kind of the glide path
is probably longer. A flatter glide path than we thought this time last quarter, unfortunately.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just maybe picking up on that last point. You guys are generating fantastic organic
growth for this quarter over the last 12 months, and that's really without spending a lot on things like conferences
and your promotional expense to your point, Paul, has been running well below where you guys were back in
2019. So, lessons learned from the pandemic being you guys can still achieve significant growth without spending
as much. Why is that not the right passage from sort of here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
There's certainly lessons learned. I mean, we were going to a flexible work environment before the pandemic. So,
certain lessons were kind of reinforced. We could do it, but we think it's important to get people back in the office.
And we're making great progress, but obviously with the holidays and since we've been conservative as the cases
have been up.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
But the big part of a lot of those conferences, people think they're just kind of fun trips. They're very educational.
The advisors get a lot of training and develop a lot of it on courses that they do, and it's important culturally. So, I
think advisors understand why we've had to cancel or cut back on it during the pandemic, but they wouldn't
understand if things going back to normal that they would just disappear.
So, we certainly have learned you can do a lot of things with less travel. There's a lot of things that require that
face-to-face input. And frankly, we all know it from our own firms, there's a lot of – people are tired of not being
together and not seeing each other and interacting even though they like the flexibility. So, we got to find that
balance.
But the conferences are important culturally. They're important to get people together, keeps their bond with the
firm, and for training development. I mean, there's a lot of facets and they do cost money. But just as the investor
conferences of many of people in this firm will start back up post-COVID, some have been able to sneak some in,
but you do them for the same reason and so are we.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Makes sense. My second one is really just a follow-up and I'm sorry if I missed it. I think Steve
asked the question around just the kind of assumptions around reinvestment spend on the back of the higher
rates and the tailwinds you guys are going to get from obviously materially higher revenues on the back of high
interest rates. So, should we think about an acceleration in investment spend and things outside of comp as rates
go higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We don't have anything planned. I mean, we're going to – we'll have the same pressures on technology and what
are we going to spend, we're going to have as we grow, support will have to grow. We're spending a lot of time
automating the back office. So, there are things that cost money. There's been comp pressure in the industry. We
haven't – I don't think felt it as – we've felt it but it hasn't been as grave as a lot of other people have said it's been
or people leaving. Our turnover isn't up very much. And, again, I think that's culturally and we pay people well off
a good year.
So, I don't see any big initiatives. I think three or four years ago, we had a huge initiative to kind of redo the whole
compliance infrastructure and back office and systems and gear up. But you're seeing the leverage of that now
where those aren't really going up commensurate with revenues. So, we don't have any major plans. I don't know
what we'd change over the next three or four years. I'm sure there'll be investment initiatives, but nothing like we
had three or four years ago.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just one on the AFS book, the growth there slowed a bit in the quarter. Just
wondering if you could comment on your appetite to reaccelerate the growth there given the recent move we've
seen really in the belly of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're keeping an eye on it. We do plan on growing it modestly throughout the year, but we're trying to
position ourselves for the increase in short-term rates. So, taking four to five years of duration because there's not
a lot of three to four-year paper out there that's available. The Fed is still buying. But to take the four to five years
of duration for 1.2%, 1.3% is not overly compelling in a rising rate environment.
So, we're trying to preserve as much flexibility as possible. We do have a preference for being more exposed to
the short end of the curve – the really short end of the curve. And so, I think we're being kind of deliberate and
patient as we always are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And I think also we were – we debated when we knew rates were falling whether it was the lock in and we thought
we're just better off long-term with a floating balance sheet. So, now that we see all predictions are rates will rise,
you never know. It's kind of a – it's kind of the wrong time to abandon that, if you believe that rates are really
going up and you're going to get a bunch of raises in the next year as people are predicting now.
So, we're not – we are investing and growing the securities book, but we're not going to raise to do it because we
think within a year we'll look back and say, gosh, we probably shouldn't have done that, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. And if I could just ask a follow-up earlier to a question that was asked on the administrative
compensation in the PCG segment, you mentioned that it only grew 5% last year despite 19% growth in the
segment revenue. And now we've seen that accelerate to 14% year-over-year growth in the first quarter here. I'm
just trying to get a sense of this [indiscernible] (00:50:23) acceleration in this line for the full fiscal year, if there's
anything to really note in that line in terms of seasonality in the fiscal first quarter.
And then, if you could just maybe just give an update in terms like the medium-term outlook for that administrative
compensation line for PCG, is it right to think about that line as being kind of a mid-single digit growth line over
time on a normalized basis? If you could just comment there, that'd be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. There's a lot of factors. There's a lot of items that go into that line. I mean, there's, of course, seasonality as
there is with most compensation-related line items. But one of the line – one of the factors that goes into it is just
the accruals for benefits which are based on profitability growth. So, you're going to see growth in that line with
the growth in profitability.

And as Paul says, we have been very generous in terms of compensation to our associates. We have a long track
record of sharing the success of the firms with our associates. And with our fiscal year end being in September,
this line now reflects the salary and bonus increases that we gave at the end of our fiscal year end. You'll start
seeing that probably for most of our peers starting next quarter. So, I think this is – there's a lot of factors that go
into it, but as I said earlier, we're really focused on realizing the operating leverage going forward.

Christopher Allen Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered already. I guess just a quick one, just on the
client cash balances obviously helped by net new asset growth and [indiscernible] (00:52:10) percent of assets.
I'm just wondering if you see any typically seasonality there towards the end of the calendar year. And any
commentary just on – any shift in the risk appetite from a client perspective to start this year just given where the
markets are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. As Paul said, really the fluctuation in cash balances, the extreme fluctuations really are more dependent on
market movements. We have seen some end of calendar year buildup of cash over history over time. And then, of
course, as we get to the tax season in April, some of that cash gets used to pay taxes. But I would say that the
growth that we saw this quarter was really due to the fantastic organic growth that Paul was describing earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think if you look at client sentiment, I think – the most recent, it's been pretty flat with last quarter at about half
are confident in the stock market. Good news is 95% are still confident in their advisors. So, I think in an uncertain
times, people aren't going to rush to invest cash versus three or four years ago when you're in the middle of a run,
it looks like it's continuing to run. People are more likely to invest
So, I don't see any pressure for that number to really go down. I don't see a rush for them to put money into the
equity market. And again, as a percent of assets, it's lower than historical. So, I think we're doing well there. So, I
wouldn't expect any fluctuations. You never know, right? So, the market is dynamic, but I think we're in good
shape.

All right. So I'd like to thank everybody for joining. I believe that not only do we have fantastic quarter. All the
indications, recruiting is strong. We have upside on interest rates. Our pipelines in investment banking are very
strong. It's hard to give – I've been around too long or I see M&A come and go depending on market conditions. If
you had a really sharp drop in rate or equity markets, that certainly could impact it. But in a normal state, that's in
great shape.
And as long as we continue to first retain our advisors and have them do the great job they continue to have done
this last year and last quarter and our recruiting momentum is extremely strong, it's a – it feels good to start the
calendar year where we are. Hopefully, COVID gets through the system and we can have more of a normal life.
And – but it was a good quarter and I think we're well-positioned going forward. So, I appreciate you joining us
