I will now turn the call over to Charlie.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll
then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions.
Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results were solid with $5.1 billion of net income, diluted
earnings per share $1.42, and ROE of 11.7% and an ROTCE of 13.9%. All were up from the second quarter. Our
earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago, as we've been making strategic investments in many
of our businesses and deemphasizing or selling others. Our revenue sources are more diverse, and our fee-
based revenue has grown 16% during the first nine months of the year, largely offsetting the net interest income
headwinds we have faced over the last year.
We have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while
investing heavily to build a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity.
Headcount has declined every quarter for four years and was down 20% since the third quarter of 2020. Our
expenses in the third quarter were down from both the second quarter and a year ago.
Average loans declined from the second quarter, as we have maintained strong credit standards and are focused
on returns over volume. We've continued to grow our credit card portfolio with balances growing for 13
consecutive quarters, and commercial loan demand remains weak, reflecting economic uncertainty and the
expectation that rates will be lower in the future.
Overall deposits declined slightly from the second quarter, but deposit balances at our customer-facing
businesses continue to grow, which has enabled us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury deposits. We've
started to reduce deposit pricing in response to the recent Fed rate cuts, and we're closely monitoring marketing
conditions and will continue to make adjustments.
Both our consumer and commercial customers have remained resilient. In our wholesale businesses, credit
performance improved from the second quarter with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and
commercial and industrial loan portfolios. The office market remains weak, and we continue to expect additional
charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio and have accordingly maintained strong allowance
coverage.
Overall, customers in our consumer businesses continue to hold up relatively well, benefiting from the strong
labor market and wage growth. Consumer charge-offs declined in the second quarter, driven by lower losses in
our credit card portfolio, while our other consumer portfolios continued to perform well, reflecting the benefit of
prior credit tightening actions. We continue to look for changes in consumer health, but we have not seen
meaningful changes in trends when looking at delinquency statistics across our consumer credit portfolios.
Both credit card and debit card spend were up in the third quarter from a year ago, and although the pace of
growth has slowed, it is still healthy. We continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments
with lower deposit and asset levels, where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth. The
benefits of inflation slowing and interest rates starting to ease should be helpful to all customers, but especially
those on the lower end of the income scale.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Our capital position remains strong with our CET1 ratio of 11.3% up from 11% last quarter, and we continue to
return significant amounts of excess capital to shareholders. We repurchased $3.5 billion common stock in the
quarter and $15.6 billion of common stock during the first quarters of this year, up over 60% from a year ago, and
we increased our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%. Shareholders have meaningfully benefited
from our capital management actions, as our earnings per share are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2019,
benefiting from the 22% decline in diluted average common shares over the same period.
Now let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work, which remains our top
priority. We continue to move forward with confidence and believe we have the right culture, team, discipline, and
sense of urgency to complete the work that's required. That includes what is required under the recent formal
agreement we entered with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
We are also continuing to execute on our other strategic priorities. We continue to build our credit card business,
and this past quarter, we launched two new co-branded credit cards with Expedia, which provide our customers a
unique travel rewards program with instant discounts, enhanced perks, and accelerated rewards. Our broader set
of credit card products continue to be well-received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells
Fargo, with nearly 2 million new credit cards accounts this year.
Last month, we announced a multiyear co-branded agreement with Volkswagen Financial Services. Starting in
the first half of next year, we will be the preferred purchase financing provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in
the United States. The investments we've been making in our Consumer, Small and Business Banking segment
are starting to generate growth. After several years of no growth, net checking accounts have now grown for three
consecutive quarters, and we believe our debit card share has started to increase as well.
Mobile active users increased by 1.6 million, or 5% from last year. We are also investing our branches and have
refurbished over 460 branches during the first three quarters of this year. We continue to hire proven leaders in
our corporate investment bank. In investment banking, we made several important hires focused on key coverage
and product groups to help us build on our momentum and grow the business. We also hired a new vice chair of
corporate banking, who is focused on helping us continue to expand and grow that franchise. We also continued
to track experienced leaders in other areas. And in the third quarter, Bridget Engle joined Wells Fargo as Head of
Technology, reporting to me. I've worked with Bridget in the past and know firsthand how her deep experience
leading large-scale technology transformations at large global financial institutions will benefit Wells Fargo.
Our strategic priorities also include focusing on businesses that are core to our consumer and corporate clients
and when they aren't, shrinking or selling them. As part of this effort during the third quarter, we announced we'd
entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial
mortgage servicing business. We will continue servicing agency loans and loans held on our balance sheet.
Looking ahead, overall, the US economy remains strong with inflation slowing and a resilient labor market,
boosting income and supporting consumer spending. Company balance sheets are strong, contributing to both
consumption and investment in the economy but slowing demand for commercial lending. We continue to be
prepared for a variety of economic environments, and we'll balance our desire to increase returns and grow while
protecting the downside. We have one of the most enviable franchises in the industry and a top management
team capable of delivering strong results.
I want to thank everyone who I worked with at Wells Fargo for everything they've done to transform this great
company. I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results in the third quarter. We again
saw good growth in non-interest income across most businesses, and expenses were well controlled. Net income
for the third quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.42 per diluted common share.
During the quarter, we took the opportunity to reposition a portion of the investment securities portfolio. Our
results included $447 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities. This included the sale
of approximately $16 billion of securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into securities with yields
approximately 130 basis points higher than the securities we sold. The estimated earn-back period for this
repositioning is a little over two years.
Without the impact of the investment securities portfolio repositioning, earnings per share would have been $1.52.
When looking at our results compared with a year ago, I'd remind you that our third quarter results last year
included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits.
Turning to slide 4. Net interest income declined $233 million or 2% from the second quarter. $128 million of this
decline was due to the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts in Wealth and
Investment Management that we highlighted on last quarter's call. This was the lowest linked quarter decline in
net interest income since third quarter 2023 as customer migration to higher yielding deposit products continued
to slow and the pace of deposit pricing increases also decelerated. Deposit costs were up 7 basis points in the
third quarter with approximately half of this increase driven by the pricing increase on sweep deposits in advisory
brokerage accounts.
The third quarter increase in deposit costs was lower than the 10 basis point increase in the second quarter and
the 16 basis point rise in the first quarter. In response to the Federal Reserve rate cut in September, we have
reduced rates on promotional deposit offers in our consumer businesses. Pricing on sweep deposits in advisory
brokerage accounts, which are aligned to money market funds, will continue to move in line with Fed rate cuts.
Commercial deposit pricing has responded quickly to Federal Reserve rate reductions, just as it did when rates
were rising. We are continuously monitoring competitive conditions and deposit trends and will adjust pricing, [ph]
tenor and e-balance (00:12:08) requirements based on our observations.
We highlight loans and deposits on slide 5. Average loans were down from both the second quarter and a year
ago with continued growth in credit card loan balances, more than offset by declines in most other categories. I'll
highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits increased $1.4 billion
from a year ago, and growth in our customer deposits enabled us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury
deposits. Average deposits were down $4.8 billion in the second quarter. This decline was driven by $18.5 billion
reduction in higher cost corporate treasury deposits while customer deposits grew $13.7 billion from the second
quarter. All else equal, a reduction in corporate treasury deposits is a positive for net interest income in the
current environment.
Turning to non-interest income on slide 6. We had strong growth in non-interest income, up 12% from a year ago.
As Charlie highlighted, this growth reflects the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as
well as market conditions. We grew non-interest income across most categories including double-digit increases
year over year in many of our largest fee-generating activities including investment advisory, net gains from
trading activities, deposit related fees, and investment banking. We also benefited from improved results in our
venture capital investments. I will highlight the specific drivers in non-interest income growth when discussing our
operating segment results.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Turning to expenses on slide 7. Non-interest expense declined from both the second quarter and a year ago. The
impact of our efficiency initiatives helps reduce salaries and professional and outside services expense compared
with a year ago. These declines were partially offset by higher revenue related compensation, predominantly in
Wealth and Investment Management, as well as higher technology and equipment expense. Operating losses
declined from a year ago and from the higher levels we had in the first half of this year.
Turning to credit quality on slide 8. Net loan charge-offs decreased 8 basis points from the second quarter to 49
basis points of average loans. The decline was driven by lower commercial net loan charge-offs which were down
$145 million from the second quarter to 24 basis points of average loans with lower losses in both our commercial
real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio
declined in the third quarter, market fundamentals remain weak and we still expect commercial real estate office
losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients.
Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $45 million from the second quarter to 83 basis points of average loans,
driven by lower losses in the credit card portfolio. Non-performing assets decreased 3% from the second quarter,
driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Commercial real estate office non-accruals declined
$164 million which included paydowns and net loan charge-offs.
Moving to slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $50 million in the second quarter with
modest declines across most asset classes, largely offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans driven
by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for loans has been relatively stable over the past year as credit
trends remain within our expectations. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and
commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% since third quarter of
2023.
Turning to capital liquidity on slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 11.3% continue
to be well above our new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%, which became effective in the fourth
quarter. The increase in our CET1 ratio from the second quarter included a benefit of 28 basis points from higher
accumulated other comprehensive income due to lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security
spreads. With the $3.5 billion of common stock repurchased in the third quarter, our share repurchases during the
first three quarters this year were $6 billion higher than in the same period a year ago, and diluted average shares
outstanding declined 7% from a year ago.
Turning to our operating segment results, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11. Consumer,
Small and Business Banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances and the
impact of customers migrating to higher yielding deposit products. However, the pace of migration continued to
slow. The slight increase in home lending revenue from a year ago was driven by higher mortgage banking fees.
Credit card revenue declined 2% from a year ago as lower fee revenue more than offset higher net interest
income. Auto revenue decreased 24% from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread
compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was also driven by lower loan balances
and loan spread compression.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 14% from a year ago
reflecting the progress we've made on simplifying the home lending business but grew 4% in the second quarter.
We also continued to make progress on reducing the size of our servicing business. The amount of third-party
mortgage loans serviced was down 16% from a year ago.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Since we announced our new strategy early last year, we reduced head count from lending by 46%. The size of
our auto portfolio continued decline with period-end loan balances down 14% from a year ago driven by previous
credit tightening actions. Origination volume in the third quarter was stable year over year and grew 11% in the
second quarter. Debit card spending increased $2.3 billion or 2% from a year ago. And credit card spending was
up 10% from a year ago, with growth in all categories except fuel. Payment rates were modestly lower than a year
ago but remained above pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 1% from a year
ago, driven by lower net interest income reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury
management fees. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue decreased 4% from a year ago driven by lower net
interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from equity investments. Average loan
balances in the third quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand remained weak as many
clients remained cautious about investing in inventory buildup and in capital expenditures due to economic
uncertainty and high borrowing costs.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 14. Banking revenue was down 5% from a year ago,
driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a
year ago reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue. Markets
revenue increased 6% from a year ago driven by strong performance in rates, structured products and
municipals, partially offset by lower revenue in equities. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by
continued reduction in our commercial real estate portfolio and lower loan balances and banking as clients
continue to access capital markets funding.
On slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 5% compared with a year ago due to higher
asset-based fees driven by increased market valuations, as well as higher brokerage transaction activity, partially
offset by lower net interest income driven by the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage
accounts. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth
quarter results will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were up from both a year ago and from July 1.
Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined a year ago driven by net losses on debt securities
related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by improved results from our
venture capital investments.
Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and non-interest expense on slide 17. We currently expect
fourth quarter 2024 net interest income to be roughly in line with the third quarter of 2024, which would imply an
approximately 9% decline in full year 2024 net interest income compared with 2023. Based on this expectation,
we believe we are close to the trough. However, exactly when this occurs will be influenced by a variety of factors,
including the pace of Fed rate changes, deposit mix and pricing, and day count.
Turning to expenses, we still expect full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $54 billion, which
has not changed from our guidance last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and
customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year.
In summary, we had solid results in third quarter, which demonstrated the progress we were making to transform
Wells Fargo and improve our returns. We grew non-interest income by 12% from a year ago, with growth across
most businesses. We achieved this double-digit growth even with the $447 million loss we took to reposition the
investment securities portfolio, which will start to benefit our results in the fourth quarter.

While this growth in non-interest income was more than offset by an expected decline in net interest income, the
investments we have made in our businesses to drive better fee income and diversify our revenue were evident.
We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with expenses down from a year ago and head count
down for 17 consecutive quarters.
Our results also reflected our credit discipline and strong capital position, which has enabled us to return more
than $23 billion to shareholders over the past year through common stock dividends and share repurchases. And
while we are pleased with the progress we've made, we are even more excited about the additional opportunity
we have throughout all the businesses to continue to improve our results.
We will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first
question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Sir, please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to start with NII. So your fourth
quarter number should be flattish with the third quarter level. And I believe you mentioned toward the end of your
prepared remarks that you believe Wells is sort of close to the trough. Was hoping you could just unpack, please,
a bit more what you see is the swing – the main swing factors either way, as well as kind of what it might take
from here for it to begin to inflect back upward more visibly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Scott, no, I appreciate the question. So, I mean, it's the same drivers we've been talking about now for the
last number of quarters. So, obviously, deposits and the mix of those deposits is going to be a big factor in the
near term. I think, as – you can see in our trend that NIB deposits were behaving pretty well.
I will note, though, in the trend, that there is a product switch conversion that we did that sort of impacted NIBs
and IBs. So if you take that out, the percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits is effectively flat to the third
quarter. And so that's the first time now in a while where we've seen that be the case. And so that's one of the
factors that we'll have to see sort of play out for a little bit longer time period, but so far so good in terms of that
trend participating in the way we thought, or behaving in the way we thought.
Obviously, deposit pricing, as rates come back down, is going to be a big factor. If you look at, as I said in my
remarks on the consumer side, we've already adjusted the promo rates as well as CDs. Those will continue to
adjust as rates move. We're seeing exactly what we thought we would see on the most interest rate-sensitive
deposits. So on the commercial side, as rates started to come down, the betas are exactly what we thought and
are pretty high for those deposits. So that's working.
Obviously, we haven't seen any loan growth but we weren't expecting that, but that'll be a factor, as you sort of
look a little bit longer time period. And then, this is a little bit in the weeds, but as you sort of look at the first

quarter, you do have day counts and things to kind of adjust for, so you could bounce around a little bit depending
on the quarter based on factors like that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then you touched – I appreciate that. Then you touched on loan demand as a factor as well.
You all have been pretty reserved regarding that backdrop throughout the year, which has been borne out to be
correct. I guess, hopefully, we're beginning to get some clarity on some of the unresolved issues, like cost to
borrow, and I guess we're getting closer to the election. Maybe just some additional thoughts on the overall
outlook there if possible, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No, I think – I mean, you hit on a couple of the things that people are thinking about. But based on the
conversations our teams are having with clients, I think people are still being very prudent about borrowing. I think
the 50 basis point reduction is helpful but not by itself a factor that will drive people to borrow or not. I think they'll
need to see that come down more meaningfully if that's like the driving force.
The uncertainty around the election, the uncertainty around just macro backdrop, I think as people get more
confidence, that base line case of a soft landing will materialize. You get past the election, you see rates come
down a little bit. I think all those things will come together and help give clients more confidence about either
building inventories or making further capital expenditures that they're holding off on now. So I think you've got to
see a few of those things come together. And as you say, as we get closer to the end of the year, you'll start to
get a little bit more visibility there and we'll see as it goes.

I guess, the first question, I think Charlie addressed this a little bit in his opening remarks around expenses. And I
appreciate you're not talking about 2025 today. But big picture, looking at your slide 7, personnel expenses flat
$8.6 million year-over-year, non-comp flat $4.2 million year-over-year. From a shareholder perspective and given
what you've said, is it fair to assume we continue to see some of this flatlining trend where there are enough

savings to reinvest in the platform, grow fee revenues, and do all the stuff that you're doing, but without seeing a
meaningful change in these two categories as we look forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Ebrahim, this is Charlie. I guess I'd just repeat what we've said in the past, which is we think that there continue to
be meaningful efficiencies around the company, but we also are investing in both spending whatever we need to
spend in the risk and regulatory space, as well as investing for the future. And when we get to next quarter, we'll
talk about 2025 and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves because that's something that we think we've
done a good job of balancing historically and will continue to balance it going forward in our thinking. And when
we've got specifics to share, we'll share it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
And Ebrahim, I'd just maybe put out one other thing. As you look at things like personnel expense, obviously,
there's lots that go underneath that. So we are seeing the efficiency come through on salaries and other items
and that's offset by revenue-related expense mostly in the Wealth and Investment Management business. And so
that's a good thing. Right? So you may see that bounce around, but underneath that is the efficiency really
coming through as head count continues to come down. I think we've all probably pointed it out. That head count
came down again in the quarter, so we're continuing to execute on that part of the efficiency agenda as well as all
the other non-personnel expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
But again, I don't think our thinking has changed about efficiency opportunities, but also opportunities to invest in.
So we just need to go through our own internal process as we think about 2025, and when we finish that, we'll will
share it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just maybe one quick, Mike, I'm sorry if I missed it, on NII. It's an asset-sensitive balance sheet
because of September 50 basis points cut. I would have assumed fourth quarter NII would have declined and
maybe there's about $50 million of bond book restructuring help. Just why is NII not going down despite the 50
basis points cut? And is there more room for additional restructuring as we look forward? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I mean, look it's just a confluence of all the factors that come together, right, around sort of what's
happening with the mix of deposits. Our mix is a little bit different, obviously, than others. I think the pricing actions
we took across the deposit base help as you look into the fourth quarter as well. And then, obviously, we've got
assets continue to kind of reprice up. We've got the repositioning but also just normal reinvestment as we see
maturities roll. I think on repositioning, we've been sort of repositioning the portfolio for a while. We'll continue to
look at it. Nothing on the horizon right now, but we'll continue to look at it as we always do, and we'll let you know
if we decide to do more.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question is could you remind us based on your understanding what happens next after
you submit your third-party review to the Fed as it relates to the asset cap work stream?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, so just the way consent orders work – I'll it answer very generally because we don't talk about anything
specific relative to where we are or what the timing is. We haven't and we won't – is you get a consent order, we
need to do the work to develop a very detailed plan. Regulators then look at that plan and give us feedback on the
plan. We execute on that plan.
And whatever is required in that submission, when we're done with the work, we submit it to them. And then they
have done some work along the way, but they generally do a review after the submission. And then they've got a

series of formal processes that they need to go through to make the decision on whether the work has been done
to their satisfaction. And when that's done, we find out about it and you find out about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And as a follow-up, you bought back $3.5 billion of shares in the third quarter. Mike, is this about the
pace that we should expect until we get your next SCB in June? I'm just trying to think about framing the buyback
opportunity over next few quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, Erika. We don't really talk about quarter-to-quarter pace. But I think if you look at where we stand from a
capital perspective, we're 150 basis points over the new reg minimum plus buffers of 9.8%. So we go into this
environment with plenty of excess capital. We're going to generate more capital obviously through earnings as we
go. And then we go through the normal process that we go through every quarter to look at sort of the
opportunities we have to help support clients.
We look at the risks that are out there, and then we'll decide on exact pacing sort of as we go. But we're happy
that we were able to buy back $15.5 billion so far year-to-date. And continuing to give excess capital back to
shareholders is something that's top of mind for us.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. So first question, just want to understand if the asset cap were to be removed – well, I should say when the
asset cap is removed, right, are there opportunities for you to lean in anywhere in terms of asset growth because
I've heard you in the past several times and I would assume it's same today that the asset cap is not keeping you
from doing anything that you want to do? And maybe that's wrong, but just want to understand where you would
lean in when it does get removed.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Sure. Mike, I'll start and then you can either amplify or change if you disagree with anything I say. I think what we
see and what we have talked a little bit about is the places where we have been the most careful about the assets
and our liabilities today is around. On the wholesale deposit side, there's certainly been places where we'd have
to be very careful about not bringing on significant deposits because we want to make sure that we've got the
room to serve customers elsewhere both relative to their borrowing needs as well as consumer deposits. And
obviously, when commercial deposits come in, it brings cash with it.
The other place has been in our markets business, where we actually have – since the asset cap has been in
existence, we've not just limited but reduced somewhat the financing abilities that we have for our customers. So,
those are the two places where we'd probably see the impact immediately. Not incredibly significant changes by
any stretch of the imagination. But we've been – had to be very, very careful in those two places. And then
beyond that, it's just normal growth opportunities that we would see across all the different parts of the company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And on the expense side, you've talked in the past about the $2.2 billion that has been invested to address the
issues in the consent order and to deal with them. When the consent order goes away, is there an opportunity to
pull back on that at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
We're not even – honestly, we literally aren't even thinking about that. We still have more work to do. We've said
that that is the most important thing. At some point, can we become more efficient in some of the things?
Absolutely. But what's most important is, from our standpoint, to make sure that the things we've built become
part of the culture of the company. So it's just not – when we think about efficiencies, we think about there are
plenty of other places for us to drive efficiencies and not focus on those activities at this point.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping you guys could talk about the anti- money laundering KYC, the disclosure
[indiscernible] (00:36:54) regulatory outcome on that. And given that it was in your 10-Q and so public, wondering
if you could just add some color around it. And then also just what it might mean to expenses and anything else
we should be mindful of going forward. Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Yeah. I mean, we put out something when we entered into the formal agreement with the OCC. And, like other
things that we find and they find, we take them extremely seriously. We're going to get the work done. As I've said
in my prepared remarks, I think as we identify issues and we see that there are things that have to get built, we've
got confidence that we've got the ability to do it. I would say – relative to the cost around it, I'd say the two
different pieces, which is just like all of the control-related work, we're going to spend whatever is necessary.
At this point, as we sit and look at the $54 billion expense base, don't see it having anything meaningfully that we
need to talk about beyond our ability to spend as we've discussed. And I would also mention that, and I think
we've said something about this, which is a significant amount of the work that is required in the consent order
we've been working on. And so, as we think about what we're spending, we're spending a significant amount of
money relative to what's necessary in that order already.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, are you able to comment, is this kind of a Wells specific thing or an industry-wide kind of area
focus? Because we know the banks are responsible not just for kind of policing their customers, but really keeping
track of all the money that's moving around. It seems like it could be a broader focus on that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up with the regulatory side. And can you remind us of the
mechanics of the asset cap without providing any insights as to when you think it may come off? But can the
asset cap be removed in your opinion without the consent order being removed completely?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Listen, I would – for anyone who is – if you have questions on the 2018 Fed consent order, it's very readable. It's
something like – I don't remember exactly, but it's like five pages – seven pages, Mike is telling me, of which there
are like – there's a page in there which is really the page that lays out what we have to accomplish and how the
Fed is going to look at things. So it really is very digestible. So I'll give you a brief summary. But again, please, I'd
point you back to it if you want to go through it.
We're required to – the board needs to be more effective. We need to build out operational risk and compliance in
the company. To lift the asset cap, that work needs to be adopted and implemented, and to lift the entire consent
order, it needs to be effective and sustainable. And so, that's what's laid out the way the Fed will interpret those
things and relative to things going on in the company is certainly their bailiwick. As I've said, we're very focused

on getting the work done and feel good about our ability to get it done given what we've shown that we can do
here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it. And then, the other question I had was related to the trading gains line.
And you've been putting up over $1 billion there per quarter in trading gains. What are some of the puts and takes
in that line that can create some volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I'll – it's Mike, I'll take that. Obviously, volatility in the market is a big factor. So it's kind of the market
conditions that we operate in. You generally have some seasonality to that line item as well but in the third and
fourth quarter as you get through the holiday season. And then I think where we have been focused there is really
just continuing to methodically improve the capabilities, make sure we have the right people in the right seats, we
continue to improve all of our technology and e-trading capabilities.
And we're seeing good results of that, but it's something that can move around based on market conditions quite
a bit. But our focus is just to make sure that we continue to have the right capabilities to serve clients. And we've
been pleased now that we've strung together probably seven quarters of pretty good performance there and we
look forward to what happens going forward.

Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just around the – a little bit more around the securities repositioning, how much of a benefit to [ph]
manager's (00:42:41) income did the securities repositioning have this quarter? And how much of a – would it be
a full quarter impact that you would expect for the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Very little in the third quarter. It's all done. So it's in the run rate for the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

It's in my remarks where we did about $16 billion of repositioning. We picked up about 130 basis points on that.

Michael P. Santomassimo A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately, just around the fee income commentary, I appreciate the
color you provided around the trading outlook. Can you perhaps unpack the rest of your expectations there just on
the fee side, how we should think about the trajectory of wealth management and possibly on the card side and IB
as well? Just what you're seeing there in terms of underlying drivers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I'd first – I mean there are like 15 underlying drivers. Right? And so you should look at each of the specifics
and do your own modeling based upon what you think. Right? We've got credit card revenues. We've got trading.
I mean all these different pieces. It's just not one monolithic number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And maybe I could just give you a couple pieces or color underneath that. So, obviously, on the investment
management line, market levels matter a lot as we've pointed out. About two-thirds of that line is equities. The rest
is fixed income. Most of that gets priced in advance based on the first day of the quarter, last day of the quarter,
prior quarter. So that's a pretty good way to sort of think about that line going forward.
If you look at card fees, as Charlie talked about, we've got a debit card and credit card business. As we sort of
see growth across the economy and we're successful in growing our business, that'll drive that line.
Investment banking is somewhat market dependent, but we've been investing there quite a bit, and so the goal is
to increase market share methodically over time. And so those are kind of the biggest pieces of the puzzle there.
But hopefully, that's a little helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
No, that is helpful, Mike. I appreciate you walking through the details there.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 11-Oct-2024
Hi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Can you guys share with us maybe a little color on the commercial real estate office
portfolio. It looks like this stabilization may be setting in on the credit quality. Any indicators of is it getting less
worse or when you go into market property down, the marks maybe aren't as severe as they were six months or
12 months ago? Any further details here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey. I'll take it. It's an interesting question because it depends on – I think it depends on who you talk to and how
you actually ask the question. Meaning, when we look at what's actually happening, things aren't getting better.
And it is kind of more of the same, but it's impacting more properties. Maybe to some extent, there's a little bit of
contagion to properties that are fairly well leased but people looking for better deals because they think there's
weakness out there. So you may see a little bit of that. But what you see is just more of the significant revaluation
because of supply and demand that's going on as these properties kind of move through the cycle.
So as we look at it, our kind of big picture is based upon what we expected, there aren't material changes at all.
We're actually seeing that play out. But things are getting worse because there are more properties being
impacted. So it depends on whether it's versus your expectations or what you've seen in the prior period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And Gerard, maybe I'll just add one other piece. So, it's the same – we're seeing the same kind of trend
where kind of new buildings, renovated buildings in good locations are doing fine. It's older office buildings pretty
consistent across the US. But as Charlie said, it's within the expectations we've had which we were pretty down
on the space now for a while and so it's playing out kind of largely within that range of what we thought. And as I
have said over and over, like it's going to take a while to play out. This is not something that will take a quarter or
two and be over. It'll play out over a longer period of time. And we feel really good about our allowance for
coverage ratio. We feel like that's more than appropriate for kind of what we expect to see here and we're going to
continue to work with clients as best we can to grow it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then I know, gosh, it's only been less than a month since the Fed cut the Fed funds rate, and
obviously the forward curve is calling for more. And you guys – as you addressed in your prepared remarks, Mike,
about deposit costs, the behavior – I know – again it's early, but any comments on – are you seeing the
consumers and the corporate customers behaving as expected in terms of what they're doing with their deposits
with lower rates? And as the second part of that question, with your loan-to-deposit ratio not being very high of
course, is there more room for you to lower deposit costs and not have to be as concerned being over-levered?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
I'd say, like the short answer on the behavior side is not much has changed in the last three weeks. The trend
though that we have seen now for the better part of the year-ish is that we've seen less migration to higher-
yielding alternatives. We've seen good stabilization deposits across the businesses. Those trends are all still true
and we're not seeing that shift in any significant way in any of the businesses at this point. I think as you look at
both deposit pricing and the other side of the equation that you sort of brought up, on the loan side, we feel it's
really important to have very consistent approach to underwriting credit over a long period of time and that's kind
of what we've been doing. And I think that served us well, and I think that's going to continue to be the approach.

On the deposit side, I think we'll make the decisions we think are the right decisions product-by-product and

approach we're going to continue to take.
