Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per share of
$2.39, driven by continued loan growth, a favorable rate environment and effective management of balance
sheet, credit and capital. Despite the recent industry disruption, we affirm the strength of our core deposit base by
successfully retaining our relationships. While we saw some deposit pressure, it was predominantly localized and
very manageable. Our prudent risk management had us well prepared. Our effective liquidity strategy allowed us
to remain laser-focused, while seamlessly supporting customers as we opened a significant number of new
accounts. We remain focused on business as usual, winning new opportunities, attracting talent, underwriting
credit, and expanding relationships. We believe our strong deposit franchise is now even more attractive and
stable, with a lower percentage of uninsured excess deposits and less concentration with price-sensitive
customers.
Moving to a summary of our results on slide 4. Broad-based loan growth and increased non-interest income
exceeded expectations. Credit remained a key strength for the quarter. And although we saw modest migration,
we were starting from very low levels. Despite some pressures related to funding costs and expenses, we
maintained a solid efficiency ratio and produced a robust ROE and Tier 1 capital ratio.
Complementing our compelling financial results, we achieved significant milestones, including our new
partnership with Ameriprise, aimed at further elevating our Wealth Management customer experience, digital tools
and capabilities. The launch of our new Investment Banking Group and the national expansion of our Small
Business Banking platform strengthened our solutions for customers throughout their lifecycle. Further, these
initiatives advance the priority of increasing our mix of non-capital consuming fee income.
Turning to slide 5, we generated earnings of $324 million or $2.39 per share in the first quarter. Average loans
grew almost $1.1 billion. Average deposits decreased $3.5 billion, due primarily to normal first quarter seasonality
and customer utilization of funds related to [ph] Fed's (00:04:18) monetary actions.
Credit quality outperformed, with net recoveries in our criticized loan percentages remained well below our
historical average. Expenses were elevated due to pension and several larger notable items, but we maintained a
solid efficiency ratio. At all, we retained our strong capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.09%. It was
a remarkable quarter for Comerica and I'm excited about our future and our ability to support our customers, while
delivering compelling results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review the quarter in more detail.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Thanks, Curt and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6. Broad based loan growth exceeded expectations
as average balances increased 2%. Commitments grew across most business lines, up 2% from the fourth
quarter of 2022, utilization increased modestly to 46%, but remained below historical averages.
Growth in our Commercial Real Estate business of over $640 million continued to be driven largely by
construction of multifamily and industrial projects originated over the last two years in addition to the slower pace
of payoffs. Our Commercial Real Estate strategy remains highly selective, with a focus on Class A projects and
our office exposure is limited.
National Dealer Services loans grew over $360 million as a result of new relationships and continued customer
M&A. Wealth Management and Middle Market also contributed to our strong loan growth. Elevated interest rates,
lack of housing inventory and normal seasonality continue to pressure Mortgage Banker as average loans
declined to $184 million for the quarter. The MBA forecast expects higher volumes in the second and third
quarters, consistent with a normal spring and summer buying season.
Slide 7 provides an overview of our deposit activity. Quarter-to-date deposits through the first week of March
trended in line with guidance as customers continued to deploy funds into their business and we experienced
expected seasonality. Following the March industry events, excess balance diversification efforts by our
customers further impacted deposits. We saw our peak impact in the days immediately following concentrated in
certain customers with balances well in excess of their operational needs.
Outflows moderated and, in the last two weeks of March, we saw a return to a more normal pattern and that trend
has continued. The greatest outflows were localized in select portfolios with a muted impact across the rest of our
businesses. Despite onboarding new customers in TLS, balances declined as this disruptive sector diversified
deposits. Portfolios with larger than average deposit relationships such as Corporate Banking and select
customers in Middle Market California also saw a diversification within a portion of their excess balances.
These three business lines saw disproportionately high deposit growth through quantitative easing and much of
the decline offset that increase. Utilization of an FDIC reciprocal deposit product was an effective strategy, and
through quarter end, our customers placed $2 billion in balances in that solution. Deposit diversification efforts
were concentrated in more price-sensitive customers, and the increase in deposit pricing to 152 basis points was
driven by the cumulative impact of previous pricing changes. Our strategic relationship focus was proven
successful as we retained and in fact grew our total number of core deposit relationships.
Slide 8 highlights the strength of our core deposit franchise. It is important to note how elevated deposit levels
have been since 2020. With that context, our current position is much stronger than prior to the pandemic, as we
have higher overall deposits, a better loan-to-deposit ratio and a lower percentage of uninsured deposits.
Some look to uninsured deposits as the primary metric to detect risk of elevated outflows. However, we believe a
more comprehensive view is appropriate. As a commercial bank, it is natural to have a higher relative percentage
of uninsured deposits, the majority of which are non-interest bearing, which we view as a key strength and a
proxy for operating accounts.
With 95% of our commercial non-interest bearing deposits utilizing treasury management services at an average
of more than seven treasury management products for a Middle Market customer, we are integrated with our
customers' daily operations. We feel our market and business diversification, favorable deposit mix, commercial
orientation and connectivity into our customers' operations combine to create greater relative stability in our
deposit base.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
We see opportunities to even further improve the resiliency of our deposits, including strategic investments
underway to enhance payments, digital customer transformation and Wealth Management, in addition to our
national Small Business Banking strategy, which should drive granular deposit growth over time. Ultimately, our
deposit base has always been and continues to be a differentiating strength, and we expect even more stability
with a more favorable level of uninsured and a high percentage of operating deposits.
Successful execution of our liquidity strategy proved effective as shown in slide 9. Following the Following the
industry events in March, we conservatively increased our cash position and our abundant liquidity allowed
uninterrupted support of our customers and businesses usual operations. Our quarter-end loan-to-deposit ratio
was 85%, remaining below our 15-year average and very light unsecured funding maturities create flexibility to
manage funding needs and cash levels over time.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on the slide 10 declined over $700 million as paydowns of
maturities offset the positive mark-to-market adjustment of $309 million. The total unrealized loss, after tax, of
$2.1 billion affects our book value, but not our regulatory capital ratios.
Our securities strategy remains unchanged as we stopped reinvesting in the third quarter of 2022. From that peak
through the end of 2024, we expect natural portfolio attrition of approximately $4 billion and a 42% improvement
in unrealized securities losses. We maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale, providing full transparency
and management [ph] flexibility (00:11:02). As our portfolios pledge to enhance our liquidity position, we do not
foresee any need to sell our portfolio and therefore unrealized losses should not impact income.
Turning to slide 11. Net interest income decreased $34 million to $708 million as the benefit of higher rates and
loan volume were offset by the impact of lower deposit balances, deposit pricing and fewer days. We still saw a
net positive impact due to rising rates and net interest income remained incredibly strong relative to our historical
results.
Slide 12 demonstrates our desirable interest rate sensitivity profile. Successful execution of our strategy and the
current composition of our balance sheet favorably positioned us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual 100
basis points or 50 basis points on average decline in interest rates. As intended, our strong non-interest income
stream is now more insulated from rate reductions.
Credit quality continues to be a strength of our franchise and remained excellent, as outlined on slide 13 with $2
million in net recoveries. Nonaccrual loans declined and inflows to nonaccruals remained low at $9 million. Loan
growth and the weakening economic outlook drove the $30 million provision and the allowance for credit losses
increased modestly to 1.26%.
Criticized loans increased but remained well below historical levels as we saw expected credit normalization in
portfolios prone to pressure from the elevated rate environment. Office is not part of her primary strategy, only
making up 7% of our total Commercial Real Estate line of business. Of this limited office exposure, a majority is
suburban with strong contractual financial support from sponsors. Within the overall Commercial Real Estate
portfolio, pressure from the elevated rate environment contributed to a modest increase in criticized loans and we
expect continued manageable migration in the coming quarters.
Robust fee generation increased noninterest income by $4 million relative to a seasonally high fourth quarter
2022, as shown in slide 14. Capital markets income grew $5 million and is now distinguished in our reporting to
reflect the investment and opportunity in that business. Derivative income in Investment Banking offset the

seasonal lighter quarter for syndication fees. Brokerage benefited from the rate environment and strategic private
wealth investments contributed to growth in fiduciary income. Continued expansion of our non-capital consuming
fee income remains a priority. And with growth in nearly every customer category, we are excited to see the
results from this emphasis.
Turning to expenses on slide 15. We had a number of notable expenses in the quarter, including $16 million
related to modernization initiatives, $9 million of which were attributable to the Ameriprise transaction. While
litigation-related expenses and operating losses were elevated, the largest drivers related to isolated events.
Quarter-over-quarter non-salary pension expense increased $17 million as expected. Salaries and benefits
increased $8 million, driven by higher stock-based compensation with first quarter grants, inflationary pressures
and attracting talent.
FDIC insurance increased $6 million, driven by the higher statutory assessment rate and the impact of funding
late in the quarter. Occupancy came down $12 million with the reduction in lease termination fees, lower rental
expense and a seasonal change in property tax rates. Both consulting and advertising declined from a seasonally
high fourth quarter. With a track record of proven discipline, we are committed to carefully managing expenses,
balancing necessary investments for the future and overall earnings power in order to maintain a solid efficiency
ratio over time.
Slide 16 provides details on capital management. Strong profitability continued to generate significant capital to
support loan growth. Our CET1 is estimated at 10.09%, above our target, and we were excited to announce a 4%
increase in our quarterly dividend for common stock at April 1. Our conservative excess cash position impacted
our tangible common equity ratio adjusting for cash increase – we've increased over the fourth quarter in AOCI,
our first quarter TCE ratio would have increased to 9.47%. Expected loan growth, profitability and any potential
regulatory changes will continue to be carefully considered as we manage our capital strategy.
Our outlook for 2023 is in slide 17 and assumes no significant changes in the economic environment. We expect
momentum, especially in our Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services business to drive average
2023 loan growth of 8% to 9%. We continue to expect growth in both businesses, but plan to be appropriately
selective supporting opportunities most aligned with our target credit, pricing and relationship strategy. Our
estimated average year-over-year deposit decline of 12% to 14% assumes continued stabilization and reflects the
impact from Fed monetary actions that began last year in addition to the first quarter industry events.
Despite the impact of funding, we still project net interest income to be at an all-time high, growing 6% to 7% over
our record 2022 performance. Through effective execution of our balance sheet strategy and based on our
current composition, we delivered on our objective to limit rate exposure and protect a high level of net interest
income. Credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong. We continue to forecast net charge-
offs at the lower end of our normal 20 basis points to 40 basis points range and expect a gradual normalization in
credit metrics.
We expect strong non-interest income performance to drive 6% to 7% growth over 2022. Customer-related
income is projected to increase, particularly in card, due to our payment strategy and fiduciary income, which
benefits from rates and investments in Wealth Management. Risk management income related to our internal
hedging position is forecasted to increase relative to 2022, but will vary over time as rates move. FHLB dividends
created a new tailwind in this quarter. Since we do not expect to repeat the elevated derivative volumes from
2022, we expect the year-over-year derivative delta to offset positive momentum in other capital markets
categories. A reduction in our deposit service charges is expected due to an increase in commercial account ECA
rates and adjustments to our retail NSF fees, more than offsetting growth in core treasury management income.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
With robust overall non-interest income performance in the first quarter exceeding seasonally high fourth quarter
results, we feel very good about our momentum. Despite elevated expense pressures in the first quarter, we
maintained our 7% guidance for 2023 expense growth, considering expected adjustments to select discretionary
expenses. Even after including expenses related to the Ameriprise transition, we still expect modernization to be
lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We acknowledge the dynamic nature of the current environment and plan to
assess the longer-term implications of the March disruption. With a culture of prudent management, we expect to
manage expenses as appropriate based on the new environment.
In summary, we expect strong overall financial performance and forecast record net interest income for 2023.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Slide 18 highlights our compelling story. Risk management decisions made over the last several
years prepared us to emerge from the recent disruption in a strong position. We were resilient. We built liquidity.
We protected relationships and we grew our customer base. It was a great quarter for our company. Broad-based
loan growth and robust noninterest income exceeded expectations and credit quality remained excellent. We
produced an ROE of over 24% and an ROA of 1.52% and we feel very good about our outlook.
Comerica has long had one of the most enviable deposit franchises, and now, it is even better with lower
uninsured deposits, improved granularity and less price sensitivity. In addition, we have a loyal blue-chip
customer base, robust fee income, balance and interest rate exposure, strong capital, and an impeccable
reputation for credit. We are diversified in great markets to support our strategy.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our tenured and tenacious colleagues who partners extraordinary well with
our customers. Banking is based on trust, trust we have in our customers and trust our customers have in us. I
feel this period has proven the strength of our relationship model and reaffirm Comerica's stable foundation as the
trusted banking partner into the future. Thank you for your time. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. And we will first go to the line of
Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. Good morning, everyone. So, no surprise, I want to start on the deposit side. First, the color you
provide in the slides is really helpful. I'm curious when we look at the decline in the deposits from March 9 through
the end of the quarter, I'm surprised that TLS specifically, was it a beneficiary of the SVB situation. And even
when I look at the decline in Corporate and Middle Market, I'm again surprised because I would have thought the
company would have been somewhat of a [ph] port to start (00:21:39), right. I mean, you've been in markets for
decades, you've been with customers for decades. Could you take us behind the scenes, what did you hear from
your customers during this time in each of those and why were they moving balances away from the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, this is Peter. So, I would tell you that in the very beginning, for sure, we actually took on a lot of accounts
and Curt mentioned in his remarks that we opened a number of accounts from customers that were wanting to
come to Comerica from the other banks that had failed. So, during that time, we definitely took on new customers.
I think the average balance probably is just not as high.
But on the whole, we saw some departures. Some of that is because we've got a lot of late stage also, which a lot
of late stage TLS customers are going to have more deposits, but not as much credit. And so, that's where you
did see some diversification wanting to occur at that level. But net-net, if you look at our TLS slide in the back, we
have seen deposits coming down in that space going back to second quarter of last year, really.
So, what's occurred I think in this space in general has been burning through cash. So, we saw that. But we didn't
necessarily think that we would be taking on excess deposits fleeing from SVB coming to us out of this deal. We
did take on more accounts and we definitely saw that. We also saw, during the period, as I mentioned, already,
late stage fleeing, but we saw some accounts sort of spreading across not just us, but other banks as well out of
the TLS.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Yeah. Same thing there, Steve. I think on the Corporate side, in our Corporate business, that's our, sort of,
national business with banking large corporates, we saw diversification there as well. And then, Middle Market
was mostly in California.
So again, we haven't lost – in just about all of these stages, we have not lost customers. We have just seen
diversification of excess balances that they have. So, we believe that there's opportunities for those to return in
the future. We're not relying on that, but we still have relationships with these customers. We mostly have just
seen diversification. So, that's really what we've seen in those three businesses that we've got outlined on the
slide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the noninterest-bearing, so you saw a pretty sharp drop in the quarter, which
was anticipated somewhat, right, because of seasonal factors. But given everything that just unfolded, where do
you see that mix now bottoming and where's the timeframe for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Steven. It's Jim. I'll take that question. We still think that we are likely to end up very close to 50%.
We did see most of the drops occur in the DDA space over the course of the quarter. That was not a surprise to
us at all. As rates continued to go up, new customers would continue to be more rate sensitive. We knew that a
lot of reserves balances that we have were still more in DDA than interest-bearing. We knew a lot of the seasonal
outflows, relative to what came in in the second half of 2022, were likely buried in the DDA. In fact, that's where
they were.
And then, we did have some customers that switched over using some FDIC products that had been in DDA. But
for safety reasons, they were attracted to the FDIC products, which pay a nice rate of interest. So, all those things
moved us closer to the 50% number. We still think we're going to end up right around there. We moved a lot
closer to it during the course of the quarter. And so, we still expect to have really one of the strongest ratios of
noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits amongst all our peers, if not well above our closest peers. So, we
still feel really good about noninterest-bearing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. Jim, if I could ask you one last question, which is somewhat theoretical. But – so interest-bearing
deposit costs are 1.5%. If the Fed does start cutting rates in the second half of this year, but the rates you're
paying are still well below market rates, how do you model this impacting your deposit cost, right? I mean, do
market rates need to move below or close to what you're paying before you could start lowering deposit rates
yourself? Because I don't recall other periods where the banks were this far out of the money with what they're
paying and the Fed could potentially start lowering market rates. What do your models show you in terms of how
this would flow through to your interest-bearing deposit cost? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Of course, we do expect rates to continue to go up, but relative to what might happen when rates go down,
it's important to remember that we have a pretty wide distribution of rates paid to a variety of customers. So, I

don't really view that average the typical customer. We have a lot that are well below that range, a lot that are well
above that range. So, each one of those is going to respond differently.
But we do think that there is some degree of symmetry in the betas that we pay on the way up and the way down.
The key is that there likely is a couple months lag, two to three months lag when rates start to come down before
we can really respond to that drop. There's just that same lag that we saw on the way up. But ultimately, we do
think we'll be able to start cutting pay rates if in fact the Fed makes some material moves.

Ebrahim, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning. I guess, just on deposits, so you mentioned the excess deposit diversification
played a role in the quarter. One, give us a sense of like how much of your deposit base or NIB within noninterest-
bearing that you would consider operational versus excess? And do you see some of that still continuing as
businesses? And we would love some perspective around just from a customer base standpoint, in terms of small
businesses, treasurers, CFOs actively thinking about diversifying. Like, is that trend done or do we – do you still
expect that to continue? Maybe if you can start there, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Ebrahim. I'll take that and Peter may want to add on. In terms of what percentage were non-
interest bearing or operational, we view them as largely operational. In fact, 95% of our noninterest-bearing are
tied to treasury management products. So, from that standpoint, it is a largely operational base. Now, there are
fluctuations in terms of how much they need to put on those noninterest-bearing accounts to take care of

operational needs and what they can leverage from an ECA standpoint. And there probably is still just a little bit of
excess in there, which is why we see the ratio coming down from 52% to 53% down to around 50%. But we think
largely, that attrition is gone. In terms of where the diversification efforts might go, things seem pretty settled down
right now. And I think that's going to depend largely on just what happens to the industry in terms of other events
that might happen. But for now, it does feel like the diversification efforts have largely slowed down. And those are
the trends that we've seen over the last two to three weeks, three or four weeks even.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I would agree with that, Ebrahim. This is Peter. And I would just also continue to point to where we saw
most of the diversification occur and you mentioned Small Business. In our retail franchise, Small Business,
Business Banking, Middle Market, most of those businesses really have not seen the diversification issue. It's
been sort of business as usual, if you will. People using deposits for running their businesses or what – and so
forth. But the strength of the rest of our deposit base is something that we are really, really proud of and are going
to continue to lean into. And so, I think Jim is exactly right. We feel like the diversification efforts, if you will, at this
point is pretty much stabilized.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Noted. And I guess maybe just another question, Jim, around the outlook for NII, NIM. I was wondering if you
could give a sense of the trajectory that saw 6% to 7% year-over-year growth. How do you see quarterly NII and
NIM trending from your – from 1Q levels?

Ebrahim, I'm going to probably refrain from giving, as I often do, from specific NIM percentage guidance. I think
that the examples are great. This quarter is a great example of why we don't like to give that. With our business
model being a commercial bank, we do see some variations in a number of line items, cash, securities, et cetera.
In this particular quarter, we did put a lot of safety net level of cash on to the balance sheet, which does put a drag
on NIM percentage and it just creates a kind of a non-correlation between the numerator and denominator. We
just don't see them going in the same direction or correlating very well. So, the numbers that – I'm shying away
from still, we're obviously probably moving towards the low-3s, but I wouldn't want to get more specific than that
and I would just stick to the percentage guidance that we gave for the quarter and the full year.

But Jim, if rates don't get cut, do you expect fourth quarter NII to be the low point for the year in terms of as we
think about the exit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
We – obviously, we are doing a little bit of a reset with the deposit run-off. And so, we have the second quarter
guidance out there. We actually have net interest income probably growing slightly quarter to quarter after that.
That's a function of loan growth primarily. And we do expect to get some degree of seasonal deposits probably
later in the second half of the year. That's beyond the day impact that you might get. So, we do think that we're
going to be on a positive trajectory from the second quarter on. We're just essentially resetting that baseline in the
second quarter.

Good morning, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Another question on deposits for you. You noted you retained a lot of the relationships and
only lost some of the, I guess, excess balances that people were holding. So, in terms of the room to bring those
deposits back, what is the strategy here? Is it just to be up on grade or through ECR to bring those deposits back,
or is there anything else you can do? And is there a level of deposits you think would flow back once this volatility
subsides?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Manan, it's – this is Peter. The last part of your question I'll say is yes. We believe there is a level of deposits that
would flow back. I would say the number one thing that we do is to talk to our customers pretty regularly. We
continue to believe that we provide a better customer relationship, better service than other banks and quite often,
it's not unusual for people to come back to us because they don't get the service that they wanted at another
institution.
So I think when we get to the other side of this, that will probably be the number one reason we start to see
deposits flow back. But I also want to iterate again, as Jim said, that's not necessarily something we're relying on
in our outlook. We think that we will see it, but we believe that that'll just be a function of us providing great
customer service. I don't think we're going to have to pay off for it necessarily or things like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I might just emphasize too, Peter. I don't believe that across all of our portfolios, this is probably less about
rate and more about sort of two things. One is the sort of surge, excess deposits flowing out that we saw during
COVID stimulus, PPP, et cetera and we were expecting that in the quarter that we would lose some of that. And
then those that have sought diversification, I think as the noise level settles down across the industry and things

get back to normal, I think we've got a good opportunity at some of those deposits coming back on balance sheet
and we're just staying very, very close to all those customers. They have access to our relationship managers, but
also to any of us on the leadership team as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, maybe to round out the discussion on the balance sheet, you added a lot more short term and
long term debt this quarter to boost your liquidity. How should we think about the right level of liability mix outside
of deposits and the right level of cash that you want to hold on the balance sheet going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Those questions are connected to each other. Certainly, the level of cash that we hold will really be
strongly correlated to what's going on in the industry. We always want to make sure we have abundant level of
cash during turbulent times. So, we have been comfortable with our targeted $3 billion level of cash prior to the
disruption in the industry. Obviously, we pushed closer to $9 billion as we have on the slide, on slide 9 and we will
hold there for some period of time until we're sure of the industry has passed some of this turbulence. To the
extent we have loan growth, of course, we'll see that starts to go down.
On the funding side of the balance sheet, we started with very low levels of unsecured debt, as you can see on
slide 9, probably some of the lowest amongst our peers. So, we felt like we were in very good shape to begin
with. We have a lot of flexibility. We did draw on a lot of FHLB during the initial days of the crisis, which we
thought was a very prudent thing to do. The good thing is we did that in a way that gives us tremendous flexibility.
A lot of those maturities are laddered, starting this year all the way through the next couple of years. And so, we
have the option as those maturities come up to either roll them over or let them just mature naturally.
So, we feel like we have a tremendous amount of flexibility, but it's going to depend on the environment that will
drive the amount of cash we have and the amount of funding that we have on the balance sheet. But we are
starting from very low levels and we feel really good about our current position. So, we're fortunate that we have
that capability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And is that largely revenue neutral because you are raising essentially close to the Fed funds rate and then you're
deploying that in cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
There is a modest drag on that. There's probably a 40 to 50 bp drag as I look at it. And that's one of the reasons
we shied away from NIM percentage guidance. I mean, not only does cash have the capability to inflate or deflate
the balance sheet, but whether that's free cash coming in, in the form of deposits or it's cash carrying a negative
spread, that can make an impact on the NIM percentage too.
So, baked into the outlook, we do have a fair amount of cash still there. And that's one of the things that I look at
as an opportunity as we move towards later in the year and into 2024, we'll get past that modest amount of drag
from the negative spread on the cash carry.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we go to the line of Brody Preston with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone. Could I just circle back on the NII guide? I just need – I was just hoping to get
some help tying the 2Q, what – the step down that you have for 2Q versus the full year guide? Just because if I
try to run through the numbers quickly, it kind of looks like at the midpoint of the 2Q guide relative to the full year
guide, you kind of expect like a 3% step up in the back half of the year on the quarterly NII run rate. And so, can
you can you help me understand sort of how we get there and how much of that assumption is driven by what you
do with borrowings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. There's a little bit of play in there as you take the midpoints of those percentages. So, I wouldn't put the
stuff up in the second half of the year quite at that level. There's just a little bit of rounding, trying to navigate those
mid percentages that you mentioned. We do see a small step up in the second half of the year. Some of that is
days. Some of that is loan growth, a little bit of seasonal deposits we expect to come in. So, you will see a very
small step up quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year, probably not quite at the level that you just mentioned,
Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, if I could just ask one more on the deposit front and I'm sorry if
somebody else asked this and I missed it. As you think about the go-forward on deposits and customer
concentrations, and I'm thinking particularly as it relates to the TLS deposits, what are the kind of governors that
need to be put in place going forward to kind of help navigate any future liquidity events?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
I'm not really talking near term, because I don't think a lot of us think that's going to come to pass, but you never
know what's going to happen going forward. And so, how should we think about the balance sheet flexibility in a
stressed environment going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Brody, what I would say is that we've been in a bank for 174 years and we've managed through lots of
different cycles. And one thing that we've always kept central in our approach is our relationship focus. Many of
these deposit relationships we've had for decades. And while we did see some deposit decline during this period
of time, we did not see it as much in our core businesses, Retail Banking, Small Business, Business Banking,
Middle Market, Wealth Management, et cetera. And so, we're going to continue to focus on those business lines.
We will obviously have an opportunity, I think, to bring back some of the deposits that we lost along the way. But
our focus on treasury management services, our focus is on Small Business and retail deposits. Those types of
things will continue to be sort of key drivers for us. We can't fully control [ph] whether – an (00:41:01) industry
issue that unfolded like it did previously. But what we did control was we had a great liquidity playbook in hand,
and we were able to execute against that. And again, I think kind of on the back side of this, we do believe – while
it's not in our modeling, but we do believe we have a chance to get some of these deposits back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then, just one more, just on the betas. And again, I'm sorry if somebody else asked this. But have you
changed your thinking about your through-cycle beta at all, and have you changed how you think about like what
your terminal beta would be just given the deposit volatility? And I guess I'm more trying to narrow down to the
interest-bearing deposit beta if you have any color around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yes, Brody. We do see the betas going up above previous guidance. And I think we had been more in the mid-
40s last time we gave an outlook. We now see that likely hitting the 50% point sometime this summer and then
kind of hanging out there and then things get a little – things starts to go down with the lag that I mentioned
earlier. But we will likely get up to around 50% sometime in the early to midsummer on a cumulative basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Got it, and that's interest-bearing, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That is pure interest-bearing, all in.

Brody Preston Q

And I think you did say earlier that you do feel like on the way down, it might happen with a lag, but you do feel
like you'd be able to pass through the same amount of beta to the downside that you pass through on the upside.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. I'll switch gears on you and ask about credit. Could you give a little bit more color about the
increase in criticized loans? I know you mentioned, it's interest-bearing with the higher rates that's impacted it. But
if you could give a little bit more color on that. And then, secondly, on net charge-offs, is there much left in terms
of recoveries?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Peter, this from Melinda. So, I'll take the first one. The increase that we saw this quarter in criticized, I think
Jim mentioned it or Curt did in his comments. It really was expected. I mean, the reality is we've been bumping
along the bottom here now for four or five quarters at exceptionally kind of non-sustainable levels. So, over the
last couple of calls, I said we would expect to see some normalization, just given all the inflationary pressures that
customers have been dealing with, certainly the increase in interest rates.
So, those interest rate sensitive portfolios, certainly our leveraged portfolio, kind of core Middle Market,
Technology and Life Sciences, and we did see credit migration this quarter in our Commercial Real Estate book,
a couple hundred million, that is on special mentioned credit. I don't see that migrating really to any kind of loss

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
content and that's really on some projects that have pressure related to the rising interest rate environment and
from a multi-family perspective, a little bit of softness in a couple of sub-markets in terms of leasing rates and
leasing pace. So, that softness, coupled with the increased interest burden caused a couple of those projects to
move into that criticized category.
But again, I do not see lost content in that Commercial Real Estate book. We did increase our Commercial Real
Estate reserves this quarter just as a precautionary measure. But again, that commercial real estate book is
predominantly multi-family and industrial. Close to half of it is on the construction side, loan to cost and that book
is generally in the 50% to 60% range. So, there's a tremendous amount of equity and room in those projects to
hold a little bit longer, should we need to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And then, just on the recoveries for net charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Recoveries, yeah, yeah. I call that as a gift that keeps on giving. And quite frankly, recoveries are almost
impossible to predict. They've continued to surprise us really over the last four or five quarters. So, at some point,
we're going to run out of that, but I would expect it will still be modest levels, the declining of recovery in the
coming quarters. [ph] Mostly get charge-offs that's incredibly (00:45:42) low as well. There's not a lot to recover
left.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. And just one follow-up question. In the 10-K, you had mentioned possibly looking at resuming buybacks,
but I'm just wondering, just given all the uncertainty in the environment, is that kind of on hold for now on
buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I would say buybacks are on hold until further notice. There is a lot of uncertainty in the environment as you
mentioned. Certainly industry uncertainty, but perhaps even more importantly, regulatory uncertainty for all banks.
We just don't know where this is going. And we want to make sure that if there is any kind of regulatory change on
the capital side that we can get there organically, which I believe we likely, very likely will be able to do. But I think
caution is in order in that regard. And so, share buyback is certainly on the sidelines in the foreseeable future.
