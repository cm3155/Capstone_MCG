Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. Net income
totaled $137 million, which includes the effect of an after tax goodwill impairment of $16 million in our US based
equipment leasing subsidiary. Excluding this impact, net income would have been $153 million, $2 million more
than the previous quarter. The increase in net income was driven by lower operating expenses and higher net
interest income, offset in part by a higher provision for credit losses and higher income taxes. We grew loan
balances by $1 billion during the quarter. BPPR generated loan growth across almost all business segments,
reflecting the continued strength of the local economy.
Popular Bank achieved growth in commercial and construction loans. Year-to-date, loan balances had grown by
$2 billion. Our net interest margin decreased 7 basis points to 3.07% in the quarter, primarily due to a 27 basis
points increase in deposit costs. This was partially offset by higher loan balances and the repricing on loans in a
higher interest rate environment. Non-interest income remains solid and continues to benefit from steady
customer transactional activity. Excluding the goodwill charge, operating expenses decreased $17 million, driven
by lower professional fees and customer activity related fees. Credit quality trends generally remained positive.
Non-performing loans decreased once again and net charge offs remained well below pre-pandemic levels. While
we are beginning to see some credit normalization in the Puerto Rico unsecured consumer segment, we are
attentive to the evolving credit landscape and are taking action to address these developments.
Deposit balances at quarter end decreased by approximately $700 million, primarily due to a lower level of Puerto
Rico public deposits. However, average deposits for the period increased by $1.4 billion, also driven by public
deposit activities. Borrowings decreased by approximately $300 million due to the redemption of senior notes
during the quarter. Tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $50.20, a decrease of $1.17 per share as
net income for the period was offset by an increase in the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio.
Regulatory capital levels remained strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio in the third quarter was 16.8%.
Please turn to slide 4. I am very pleased to highlight that during the third quarter we crossed a significant
milestone in Puerto Rico and now served more than 2 million unique customers. Utilization of digital channels
among our retail customers also remains strong. Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million or
54% of our customer base. In addition, we continue to capture more than 60% of our deposits through digital
channel. In the third quarter, consumer spending remained healthy with combined credit and debit card sales up
6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our auto and lease loan balances increased by $104 million compared
to the second quarter, as demand for cars has continued to be strong in Puerto Rico and available inventories
have improved. Mortgage loan balances at BPPR increased by $121 million sequentially in the third quarter,
driven primarily by home purchase activity.
The Puerto Rico economy performed well during the third quarter. Business activity is solid and remains in good
shape as reflected in the continued positive trends in total employment and other economic data. The tourism and
hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy. There are roughly $51 billion of
hurricane disaster recovery, infrastructure and pandemic related funds that have yet to be disbursed. The pace of
disbursement of these funds has accelerated, and we anticipate that these funds will support future economic
activity for several years. As this infrastructure investment and the economy expands, we are well-positioned to
serve the needs of our customers and to benefit from such activity.
In short, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, particularly our strong loan growth in both Puerto Rico
and in the US, as well as the continued strength of our deposit base. We are also encouraged by the strong
performance of the Puerto Rico economy. We remain optimistic about the future of our primary market and our
ability to manage and serve the needs of our growing customer base.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Please turn to slide 5. We reported net income of $137 million compared to $151 million in
Q2. Quarterly net income includes the effect of a goodwill charge. Excluding the charge, net income was $153
million, $2 million higher than the prior quarter. Net interest income was $534 million, $2 million higher than Q2.
On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was $564 million, an increase of $5 million from Q2 due to
higher volume of tax exempt investment securities, offset in part by higher disallowed interest expenses in Puerto
Rico taxes.
Non-interest income was $160 million, essentially flat with Q2. The provision for credit losses was $45 million
compared to $37 million in the second quarter. Total operating expenses were $466 million in Q3, an increase of
$6 million from the prior quarter. This expense number includes a $23 million pre-tax and non-cash goodwill
impairment in our US based equipment leasing subsidiary.
The goodwill impairment results roughly from two equal effects. First, a higher discount rate for the projected cash
flows resulting from higher rate and equity premiums. And second, a lower projection of future income. Presently,
this subsidiary has lease balances of about $113 million and remaining goodwill of $17 million. Excluding this non-
cash expense, Q3 expenses decreased by $17 million for the prior quarter. The variance in operating expenses
was driven by lower professional fees by $12 million in advisory expenses from corporate initiatives, primarily
related to regulatory compliance and transformation efforts. And an $8 million reversal of an accrual related to
regulatory examination fees in BPPR.
During Q3, we incurred $4 million transformation related expenses compared to $7 million last quarter. Our
transformation effort is progressing as planned, but due to the stage of execution of various major projects, the
timing of some of the expenses will be somewhat delayed. Also, the decision to use in-house resources to
repurpose previously planned consulting fees into longer term investment or capitalize our initiatives has resulted
in a lower than forecasted expense. As a result, we now expect transformation expenses for 2023 to be
approximately $30 million, down from our prior guidance of $50 million. We expect Q4 expenses to be
approximately $475 million. Normalizing for the $23 million non-cash goodwill impairment, total expenses for 2023
would be around $1.82 billion or $50 million better than our original guidance, driven by lower transformation
expenses and cost control initiatives undertaken during the year.
If the proposed FDIC special assessment is implemented as presently drafted, we estimate Popular would incur
an additional expense of roughly $66 million. We will provide 2024 expense guidance, including transformation
efforts in our January webcast, once next year's budget is completed. Our expected tax rate – effective tax rate
for the quarter was 25.1%. The higher Q3 tax rate was attributable to certain tax benefits recorded in the second
quarter offset by lower income before tax. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be
between 22% and 25%.
Please turn to slide 6. Net interest margin decreased by 7 basis points to 3.07% in Q3. On a taxable equivalent
basis, NIM was 3.24%, a decrease of 5 basis points versus Q2. The decrease is driven by higher interest
expense on deposits due to increased cost of public deposits and growth in high cost deposit accounts at Popular
Bank. This was partially offset by higher loan yields and balances across all major lending categories and higher
yields in our cash balances and investments. At the end of the third quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were
roughly $17.8 billion, a decrease of roughly $700 million compared to Q2. Decrease in Q3 was consistent with
historical trends. However, public deposit balances have remained higher than we had anticipated. As such, by

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
the end of 2023 we now expect public deposits to be in a range of $16 billion to $18 billion compared to our prior
expectation of $14 billion to 16 billion. Excluding Puerto Rico public deposits, customer deposit balances grew –
were up by $46 million, primarily driven by increases in time and saving deposits at Popular Bank, offset
somewhat by retail outflows at BPPR. Approximately $300 million of client deposit at BPPR were transferred to
our broker-dealer during the quarter searching for higher yields.
Ending loan balances increased by $1 billion compared to Q2, driven by growth in almost all loan segments at
BPPR and on commercial and construction loans at PB. Year-to-date, loan balances have increased by $2 billion
versus $2.3 billion for the same period a year ago. We are encouraged by the demand for credit at BPPR and PB.
We will continue to take advantage of funding opportunities to extend credit and improve the use and yield of our
existing liquidity.
Our interest rate sensitivity is relatively neutral. We continue to expect the margin to resume an upward trajectory
in Q4. The timing results from our forecasted loan and deposit growth and mix, investment portfolio strategy and
the pace of repricing of public and incrementally retail and commercial deposit.
Please turn to slide 7. Deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are now above the prior cycle. We have seen
a total cumulative deposit beta of 34% to date, but the rate of increase of deposit cost continues to slow down. In
BPPR, total deposit cost increased by 24 basis points compared to an increase of 26 basis points in Q2 led by
public deposits. Excluding the public deposit balances, total deposit costs were 55 basis points compared to 50
basis points the prior quarter, for a cumulative beta of 7%.
In the third quarter, the cost of public deposits increased by 47 basis points compared to our July estimate of 50
basis points. We expect the cost of public deposits to increase by approximately 10 basis points in Q4. The
deposit pricing agreement with the Puerto Rico public sector is market linked with a lag. This source of funding
results in an attractive spread under market rates. At Popular Bank, the deposit costs increased by 29 basis
points compared to an increase of 54 basis points in Q2, led by retail deposits gathered primarily through our
online channel.
Please turn to slide 8. Our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage-
backed securities, which carry minimal credit risk. Including our cash position, this portfolio has an average
duration of approximately 2.2 years. In Q3, the unrealized loss of the AFS portfolio increased by $231 million,
driven by an increase of $274 million in the agency MBS portfolio, offset in part by a reduction of $44 million in the
US treasury portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, the balance of unrealized loss in AOCI of our HTM portfolio
stood at $702 million, a reduction of $44 million from Q2. We expect this loss will be amortized back into capital
throughout the remaining life of that portfolio at a rate of approximately 5% per quarter through 2026.
Please turn to slide 9. Our return on tangible equity was 9.4% in the quarter. We continue to target a sustainable
14% ROTCE by the end of 2025, driven primarily by higher net income. Regulatory capital levels remain strong.
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio in Q3 of 16.8% decreased by 6 basis points from Q2. Tangible book value per
share at quarter end was $50.20, an increase of $1.17 per share, mostly resulting from increased AOCI – sorry, a
decrease of $1.17 per share.
Given the continued uncertainty on the outlook for rates, the economy and the proposed regulatory response to
events in the banking sector, we will not engage in share repurchase during 2023. We do plan, however, to
consider a dividend increase this year. We will review future capital actions as market conditions evolve. Our long
term outlook on capital return has not changed, anchored on our strong regulatory capital ratios. Over time, we
expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the levels of our mainland peers, plus a buffer.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continued to exhibit stable credit quality trends with low
levels of net charge off and decreasing non-performing loans. Consumer portfolio, however, reflected increased
delinquencies and net charge off primarily due to the expected credit normalization. We continue to closely
monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance given higher interest rate and
inflationary pressures. We believe that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the
risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolios positions Popular to continue to operate successfully under the
current environment.
Before discussing the credit metrics for the quarter, I would like to address the risk profile of our office commercial
real estate exposure and consumer portfolios. We have included additional information for these segments in the
appendix to today's presentation. Popular consolidated office CRE exposure is limited, representing only 1.9% or
$634 million of our total loan portfolio. It is mainly comprised of low- to mid-rise properties located in suburban
areas and is well-diversified across tenant type with an average loan size of $2.1 million. The portfolio has a
favorable credit risk profile with low levels of NPLs and classified loans. In terms of our consumer portfolios, these
have begun to normalize as expected, reflecting increased delinquencies and net charge offs. The credit card,
auto loan and lease portfolios continue to exhibit delinquencies and net charge offs that are below pre-pandemic
levels, although gradually increasing. In the case of unsecured personal loans, however, the year-to-date net
charge off ratio is 3.4%, which is above the 2.5% average for the 2011-2019 period. We are closely monitoring
the performance of our consumer portfolio and have made changes to the – to our underwriting criteria to
decrease exposure to higher risk segments.
Turning to slide number 10, non-performing assets and non-performing loans continue to decrease driven by the
commercial and mortgage portfolios. The decrease in the Puerto Rico commercial portfolio was aided by the
payoff of an $11 million relationship. NPL inflows also decreased driven by lower contractual inflows in Puerto
Rico and lower commercial inflows in the US, offset in part by higher mortgage inflows in Puerto Rico. At the end
of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio decreased to 1.1% from 1.2% in the previous
quarter.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge offs increased from the prior quarter to $33 million or annualized 39 basis
point of average loans held in portfolio. The increase was driven by higher consumer and net charge offs in
Puerto Rico, mainly in the auto and personal loans portfolio. This increase was in part offset by an $11 million
recovery from a commercial loan payoff.
Please turn to slide number 12. The allowance for credit losses increased by $11 million to $711 million, driven by
reserve built up in the Puerto Rico auto and personal loans portfolio, changes in macroeconomic scenarios and
loan growth. In the US, the allowance for credit losses decreased by $18 million due to the implementation of a
more granular model for the US commercial real estate portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $44 million,
compared to $36 million in the prior quarter. The corporation ratios of allowance for credit losses to total loans
remained flat at 2.1%, while the ratio of ACL to NPL stood at 197%, up 15 percentage points from the previous
quarter.
To summarize, our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends in the third quarter, with low net
charge offs and decreasing non-performing loans. Consumer portfolios, however, reflected increased

delinquencies and net charge off due to credit normalization. We remain attentive to evolving environment but
remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date have been strong,
driven by solid earnings, robust loan growth, stable credit quality and continued customer growth. It is an honor to
serve over 2 million customers in Puerto Rico, providing a wide variety of products, services and channels and we
value immensely the trust that they place in us. Earlier this month, we celebrated Popular's 130th anniversary.
Since 1893, we have successfully adapted and led throughout changing conditions, and we are proud of our
history and the legacy that has made Popular what it is today, a strong, vibrant organization with deep rooted
values. I had the privilege of visiting many of our colleagues during the anniversary and was inspired by their
passion and dedication. We are encouraged with the progress of our transformation that position us well for the
future. We are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. Economic trends in Puerto Rico continue to be
positive, and a considerable amount of recovery funds yet to be disbursed are expected to support increased
economic activity for the coming years. Our diversified business model, robust levels of capital and most
importantly, the talent and dedication of our people, position us well to support and meet the evolving needs of
our growing customer base.
We're now ready to answer your questions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
How much – hi. I'm wondering how much of the delayed transformation expenses occur in 2024. And I guess the
total amount of transformation costs, is that now lower or is that expense just pushed out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, some of the expenses have been re-characterized, Timur. So, for example, as we mentioned,
some expenses that we expect that to be external consultants were brought in-house and some of those may end
up being capitalizable as last part of the project. Others have been delayed because the projects have taken a bit
longer to get going or whatever the case may be. So it will be a combination of some pushed into 2024 and others
that will not happen anymore. We will – that – what that combination might be will be clear when we complete our
project plan for 2024 and we complete our budget for 2024 and we will provide the guidance on expenses in
January as we normally do, including both overall expenses and transformation expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess looking at funding cost, to what extent are interest rates now done pressuring deposits
and the pressure now comes from mix shift?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, I mean, to the extent that you think the Fed is done, we will continue to have an effect because of the one
quarter lag of the effect of public sector deposit costs in Puerto Rico. But most of the rest would probably be result
of shift as opposed to base rates changing, with the sole exception of the Puerto Rico public sector, which again
will have the lag of the third quarter increases into the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. For those balances, just looking at period end over average and then seasonal expected outflows in the
fourth quarter, those balances of public fund deposits should be materially lower on an average standpoint in 4Q.
Is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, depends. We've updated our range for year-end, as you heard from 14% to 16% to 16% to 18%. If the
balances end up at the high end of that range, then the average for the fourth quarter will be not very different.
They'll be a bit lower than the average for the third quarter, but not too much different. So it depends on what –
where we end up in Q4.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Right. And then just last for me. On the credit normalization, the unsecured PR consumer book, the comment
about limiting exposure to higher risk segments, can you just maybe talk through what's been the greatest source
of stress in that portfolio and which segments you're referring to in that comment?

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Wanted to start on the expense – on – back on the expenses in the third quarter and get a little more color, if I
could, on – I didn't quite understand the noise around lower regulatory costs. Most are having higher. Can you
maybe talk a little bit more about the items that reduced expenses in 3Q? And then how that might change you
think in the fourth quarter relative to the $475 million guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's mostly professional fees, Brett. Now, that's our professional fees that – we hired a consultant to
assist us in a whole bunch of different things. And the reduction in the quarter was mostly related to some
assistance we get on regulatory matters or transformation and things of that sort. But this is – this was normally –
this number goes up and down, is just that the professional fees number tends to be a lot more stable as opposed
to coming down. So you'll notice the change. But in any given quarter, the expense in those professional fees can
gravitate from advice and regulation to advice on transformation to advice on something else. So it's just a bit
more notable this quarter, but it is mostly professional fees. The other thing is we do have a reversal of an accrual
for regulatory exam expenses that we had accrued – over-accrued in that. And that's an $8 million in this quarter,
which obviously also helped the expense number.

I think it's also fair to say that we are challenging our teams to make sure [indiscernible] (00:30:21) as much as
possible in-house versus consulting or using our consultants more intelligently. So it's not that regulatory costs are
necessarily going down [indiscernible] (00:30:30) professional fees and consulting fees are going down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then on the margin, as we think about 2024, assuming the Fed has stopped, would seem
like the margin would start moving higher with the government deposits not repricing [indiscernible] (00:30:52)
three months. Any thoughts on your willingness or ability to invest maybe some of the cash flow in the securities
portfolio into higher rates and just how you see the NII dollars playing out over the coming year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, the – probably the colloquial answer to your question is we have – we hope we'll have to have the decision
on the investment portfolio extension because we have enough loan demand that we can put the maturities into
loans. That would be our preferred outcome. That obviously is the best use of our liquidity in terms of margin.
You're correct, I mean, to the extent that the Fed is done and the pressure on the funding side should be less. We
are still originating loans that are higher rate level, so that should be helpful to margin. And the same is true of the
investment portfolio. Whatever is coming due tends to be old treasuries, older investments that were at lower
rates. So that should be helpful as well. So, the – those are the variables there and the math will be whatever the
math is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then just lastly for me, the 14% ROTCE target by 2025 seems like it's possible that that might be
achieved a little bit earlier if things line up relative to rates and loan growth. Any thoughts on timing of that target?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, the timing we were very specific in our timing. It was at the end of 2025. And this target is not an easy
target. So we're working very hard to make sure we get there. God bless you, and hope you're right that we can
get there earlier. But at this point in time, for us, it looks like the end of 2025.

Just to expand upon that last question on the ROTCE target, when you guys initially set that out, I think it was
back in January and one could have assumed or maybe you guys assumed that buybacks to be part of the story
this year, which they're not. I'm just curious when you say it's unchanged, is it just basically saying that –
reiterating what you said back in back in January or is there an update to the assumptions on capital levels
incorporated in the reiterated guidance as well?

It's unchanged.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
I want to ask the government deposit question slightly different – differently. Obviously, we're very focused on the
impact to your guys' balance sheet. But looking at them a different way, it seems like there's almost $18 billion of
government deposits now that is basically cash that the Puerto Rican government has to eventually put to work
into the economy, into the various programs, into things that should continue to help the Puerto Rico picture. Is
that accurate thinking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
It is. But keep in mind that it's a very diverse group of depositors. It's -I think we estimate over 140 different
deposit clients that have clients ranging from the Puerto Rico Treasury Department to the small municipalities.
Most of the agencies had much more money available than they did now. Some of this money is specifically
earmarked for programs, so they can't use it [indiscernible] (00:35:32) want. But definitely things are happening.
Not only the Puerto Rico central government, but the municipalities are deleveraging, which not only means that
they have money to spend, which means in the future [indiscernible] (00:35:45) have more room to borrow and to
do other capital projects if they are good projects. So, yeah, that should be a [indiscernible] (00:35:53) effect, but
again it's 140 agencies with many different programs and that are specifically earmarked. So, we definitely – it's
obviously good for the economy – it's good for the economy that the government across the board is
deleveraging, which is I think is important.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, when you talk about the earmarks, are there any like big ones out there that you kind of have line of sight
on hitting in the next couple months or years – I guess years is too far, but next couple of quarters that would
make that number change dramatically one way or another?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we have seen the pace of disbursement of federal funds increase
during the year. So, at this point [indiscernible] (00:36:38) about $2.8 billion had been disbursed. That compares
to $1.7 billion last year. So the pace is picking up. We do see – a lot of the infrastructure projects will continue to
pick up pace. There's a lot of projects in the energy sector, lot of on the water sector, there's a lot of projects,
there's a lot of highway projects going on. A lot of that is still in the planning – in the permitting, the planning, that
process. We do expect one area will pick up next year will be the [indiscernible] (00:37:13) funds for housing.
There's a number of projects that have been awarded and those are projects where private developers build in a
series of houses and the government will buy those houses from the developer and then later give it to people
with vouchers for up to like $230,000. About – there's a number of those projects has been awarded this year.
We're involved in about 11 of those. So we should see that activity pick up next year. Again, it takes permitting,
whatever, but those projects have not been awarded, so I think you're going to continue to see the basic
infrastructure, energy, highway, water and I think you're going to be beginning to see housing pick up next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Keep in mind, Alex, that probably more than half of this balance is the actual operating accounts of those 100-plus
or almost 200 clients. So there's always going to be a given balance there that in normal course of business will
never go away. So the – there is that which is will always be there. The amounts are earmarked for different
projects. There are a whole bunch of different things in different accounts for different purposes. So, it is positive
12

that the government has more cash on hand. But it would probably be an understatement to think it's anywhere
close to $18 billion. It's a fraction of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Yeah, that's great. And then just expanding on the 11 projects and some of the other things that Ignacio
you were just mentioning, does that result in a larger level of construction disbursements for Popular next year
that could help to drive loan balances higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes, definitely. I think there should be the residential construction, which has been kind of limited that should –
there should be a pickup in that from those projects. Again, it depends when they actually break ground and they
start disbursements. Again, those projects unfortunately – or fortunately for – will not last very long on our balance
sheet because the way it happens is the developer builds the homes and the government takes them out. So
instead of the take out coming from individual buyers, the government takes them out. But yes in the short run
there should be an increase, especially in the residential construction. Again, apart from the government
[indiscernible] (00:39:34) we're seeing low income tax credits also stimulating certain developments for elderly,
especially in Puerto Rico and for [indiscernible] (00:39:41) there's a number of projects that are gaining
momentum there. I think we should see some of that next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then is it fair to assume that mortgage that's been growing for a couple of quarters, is that expected to
continue just given the – obviously where rates are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, well, that's a question I ask. We've seen some pick up in the purchase activity, but you're right. I mean, I
think we've got to expect that the higher interest rates will have some impact on that. I mean, that's just basic
logic. So, a lot of the activity as we said in the...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

And then final question on loan growth, are you guys willing to disclose how much of the highway loan you guys
will take down?

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes [indiscernible] (00:40:34) I can tell you this, the highway deal is very important deal [indiscernible] (00:40:40)
from various perspectives. One, I think it shows a lot of confidence in Puerto Rico in the sense you're talking
about a 40-year concession and you had a – this is the largest project [indiscernible] (00:40:52) the Spanish
company has done in the last 15 years. And the second largest project they've done in the history of the
company. The syndicate of banks that came in was a syndicate of international banks including major Japanese
banks who have invested in Puerto Rico projects I think in a while. We took the – we shared the top lead bank
role with one of those large Japanese banks and we will be disbursing at closing approximately $240 million. And
there's another commitment for $60 million going forward for capital [indiscernible] (00:41:24) in the future. So our
total commitment is around $300 million, but at closing we'll be disbursing $240 million.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well [indiscernible] (00:42:36) have to go with your estimate of what the margin on that business is and multiply
by $2 billion because, as you know, we never disclose the specific [indiscernible] (00:42:48) of the margin on that
business. But it should be [indiscernible] (00:42:52)

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
If in fact the balances end up at the high end of the our updated range, it should contribute to NII, yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
All right, you're too quick. I was trying to catch you on your feet. I did notice that the commercial beta ticked down
on the chart that you disclosed. And it looks like it was driven by the US business with that beta ticking down from
45% cycle-to-date to 36% cycle-to-date as of 3Q and I wanted to ask if there was something specific that drove
that like a higher balance kind of account leaving that was maybe costly, just looking for some color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, there was some balance distortion of an account that had larger – high cost account that left, but that
wasn't in this particular quarter. This quarter [indiscernible] (00:43:57) costs being relatively flat. And then
therefore they kind on the last bump in rates that we saw was not kind of pass-through, so you got a little inching
down in cumulative beta due to that.

Do you think that it can continue to kind of level off or do you think that that can – with whatever happens with
rates going forward, do you think you've kind of peaked on the rate offering there and that beta can continue to
head lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, I think [indiscernible] (00:44:38) more of a stabilization. I think that intense pressure that was in
deposit cost, especially following kind of the mini banking crisis that we saw at the beginning of the year, some of
those pressures have leveled off and the fact that the rate of increase in Fed funds rates again has slowed down.
So I think all these things help reduce the pressure on that and specifically on the commercial. The area where it
continues to be a bit more sensitive is kind of like the higher cost retail deposits. There's still a fair amount of
competition both in our branches and our national online gathering platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. I also wanted to ask on the non-owner-occupied CRE growth that you had this quarter, was that a
result of prior commitments kind of funding up or was that kind of new originations? And if so, can you kind of
speak to the geographic location of it? Was it on the island or was it on the mainland? Just wanted some more
color there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I would say it's a combination of both. I mean, we had some growth in terms of our construction portfolio in New
York. We also have growth – non-occupied growth both in Puerto Rico and the US; Puerto Rico, more in the retail
space; in the US, more in the shelter, healthcare sectors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just my last one. So I guess I understand that you guys are being cautious around uses of
capital. But when I step back and kind of do the math on securities restructures, for you guys in particular, it's
pretty attractive. And it's a pretty – you kind of quickly accrete CET1 on the backend of it. And so within a couple
years you're kind of back to an extremely robust CET1 ratio, but [indiscernible] (00:46:51) earnings meaningfully
which could be beneficial to the stock price. So, how do you kind of think about securities restructuring and using
capital at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
We are aware, we've done the numbers, we – it's something that we review periodically. One of the [indiscernible]
(00:47:19) considerations when we're thinking about these things is the fact that if nothing changes and we do
nothing, we get roughly a third of AOCI by the end of next year. So that starts when you start comparing – not
taking execution risk, not taking market risk, not taking a number of other things and having that outcome, it gets
difficult to sometimes do alternative things, but we have looked at it and we continue to look at it. We have not
decided that it makes sense for us for the moment.

Kelly Motta Q

...I want to make sure I got that right. So one-third of AOCI comes back by the end of next year if no change in
rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That's what we – that's our best estimate. Yes. That number is consistent with what we've been discussing
for the last quarter or so when we did the calculation, is roughly – probably what I think is going to be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Pretty fast tangible book value accretion. Can you remind us what the cash flows are of the securities portfolio
and where you're prioritizing that money, whether just sticking it in cash, you're yielding higher rates versus loan
growth versus paying down some of the higher cost borrowings that you have?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, it's about $1 billion a quarter still that matures in the bond portfolio. And I think this quarter is a nice
example where we did everything you mentioned essentially because we mostly funded loan growth, which is our
preference. And then some of the cash also went to repayment of the senior notes. Now, we don't have an
17

immense amount of high cost debt in our balance sheet, so that option is not huge. But the preference would be
to fund client activity to the extent we can and hopefully the demand will be there for that to occur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah, no, in addition to that – this is [indiscernible] (00:49:57) again and you could see it on the presentation on
page 8. We have around $1 billion worth of like treasury notes and MBS that prepay any given quarter. That's
being then reinvested at market rates in T-bills, so you kind of see about $1 billion going off of the [indiscernible]
(00:50:16) portfolio and going into short term T-bills, which currently have very attractive yields and especially that
are exempt for Puerto Rico tax purposes as well. So you get that incremental push every quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's super helpful. I was hoping – I know portfolio – loan portfolio purchases or something you've got in
the past as things that you're looking at, just wondering if there's any update there, any appetite or potentially –
potential changes in what you're seeing in opportunities to add through some of those strategic purchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
There's not nothing to update. I mean, our appetite remains the same. If we get shown portfolios of assets that
are within our wheelhouse [indiscernible] (00:51:11) geographies and in segments that we like and we think the
opportunity, we'll take a very close look at them, but we don't have anything to report. We are looking and people
bring us opportunities all the time. Sometimes they are outside our credit box or outside of our geographies, but
yeah, we are open and we will continue to be opportunistic if the right opportunity comes our way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Last question for me and then I'll step back. I think on prior calls you had said on the fee income side about
$155 million to $160 million a quarter was a good run rate and this quarter was really strong. If you back out the
MSR gain, you're right in the middle of that. Just wondering if you could provide an update on what you're seeing
on the fee side and any give or take there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, we still think that's the right range, Kelly, $155 million to $160 million. As you know, the – one of the
reasons we like to talk about that range is that any given line in our fees will be up and down every quarter. But
the summation is actually a lot less volatile than the individual lines. So, I think that range is still the right range. In
any given quarter, the fees in credit cards may come down or the fees in something else will go up and that may
be the opposite the following quarter, so they move around a lot. But the summation actually is pretty steady
stream of business. So $155 million to $160 million still looks like the right range for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you so much. I'll step back.

Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. Just back on the fee comment there. Are you able to disclose the level or
your level of interchange fees in any given quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, we do. If the reason for your question is the newly announced proposed changes on interchange debit
fees, the proposal, if implemented as it stands, will probably mean something in the neighborhood of $3 million a
quarter to us in reduced income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
You nailed it. That's exactly what I was asking. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up on the loan purchase
question as well. I think a lot of us are paying attention to these FDIC – the loans that the FDIC is selling and a
number of them come in, in kind of unique structures, these JV structures. Is that something that you'd be willing
to take a look at or would you only really consider cash purchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, we'll look at everything. I mean, the JV structures might produce fee income if it makes sense. So we'd look at
everything. We're a little bit shy about the sharing losses with the FDIC given our prior experiences, but we'll look
at everything. I mean if the deal is right and it's priced right, we'll take a look at it.
