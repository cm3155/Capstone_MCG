Thank you, Tawanda. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Bruce Lee, President and CEO. Welcome to HTLF's

quarter and year, then turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Chief Financial Officer, for more on our results. Also
joining us today is Nathan Jones, Chief Credit Officer, who can answer questions regarding the excellent credit
quality across our portfolios.
HTLF had tremendous success and significant growth in 2022. We are driving momentum, executing our strategy
and delivering strong results that exceed expectations. This month, our board of directors approved a record
quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the company's common stock, a 7% increase from the previous
quarter. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2023. This increase reflects our strong performance for the
quarter and year, and our confidence in our strategies and ongoing results.
In 2022, revenue was a record $726 million, an increase of $37 million or 5% for the year. Total revenue
increased $10 million or 5% from the linked quarter. For the year, we delivered net income available to common
stockholders of $204.1 million and EPS of $4.79. For the quarter, net income available to common stockholders
was $58.6 million and EPS of $1.37. For the quarter, we saw a notable expansion of our net interest margin on a
tax-equivalent basis, rising 20 basis points to 3.65%.
Our efficiency ratio decreased 15% from a year ago to 54.33%. For the year, we reduced our number of
employees by 11%. We're driving efficiency, while investing for growth. And total assets grew to a record $20.2
billion, up $970 million or 5% from a year ago. Assets increased $561 million or 3% from the linked quarter. Asset
growth was driven by strong momentum in commercial and consumer loans, and we continue to see growth in
deposits and service fees.
Let's start with loan growth highlights. In 2022, we saw a tremendous loan growth of $1.6 billion or 17%, excluding
PPP across our portfolios. In the fourth quarter, loans grew $505 million, an increase of 5% from the linked
quarter and greatly exceeding our guidance for the quarter. This includes approximately $105 million in increased
credit line utilization, primarily in agribusiness and approximately $100 million of loan growth, which we previously
expected to close in the first quarter. This was an exceptional quarter and our commercial loan pipeline remains
strong at over $1 billion. We expect total loan growth of $150 million to $200 million in the first quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we saw a significant strength across our commercial portfolios. From the linked quarter,
commercial and industrial increased $185 million or 6%. Owner occupied real estate decreased $20 million or 1%.
Non-owner occupied real estate increased $111 million or 5%. Construction increased $80 million or 8%. And our
ag portfolio increased $139 million or 18%. Seasonal line utilizations were up, and we expect this to normalize in
the first quarter. For more on line utilization, please see page 24 in the investor deck.
In the fourth quarter, we saw commercial loan growth in 8 of our 11 bank markets. We added 303 new
commercial relationships, representing $296 million in funded loans, and $229 million of new deposits. On
average, new originations were of higher credit quality than the overall portfolio, as measured by risk ratings and
credit scores, and 79% of these loans have variable rate structures, compared to 69% last quarter.
The depth and breadth of our products and services is expanding relationships and developing new ones. We
have made strategic investments in specialized industry verticals and capital markets expertise, including loan
syndications, interest rate derivatives, trade finance, and foreign exchange. And we're driving business in fee-
generating products. Service charges and fees increased $2.1 million or 14% for the year and 1% for the quarter,
driven primarily by our growing credit card business.
In 2022, HTLF reached a significant milestone, surpassing $1 billion in purchase volume as a commercial card
issuer. HTLF continues to be one of the fastest-growing Visa commercial card issuers. For more on the growth of

our commercial noninterest income, please see page 20 in the investor deck. Our consumer loan portfolio saw
significant growth in 2022, increasing $87 million or 21%. Consumer loans grew $11 million or 2% from the linked
quarter. Residential mortgage increased $24 million or 3% for the year and was flat from the linked quarter.
Turning to deposits. Non-time deposits increased $302 million or 2% for the year. Non-time deposits decreased
$448 million or 3% from the linked quarter, mostly due to balance declines that occurred in our commercial
operational accounts for seasonal needs and year-end distributions, and not as a result of account attrition. We
expect these account balances to rebuild over time.
Time deposits increased $793 million or 77% for the year and $694 million or 62% from the linked quarter. The
increase in time deposits for both the year and the quarter was primarily driven by an increase in wholesale time
deposits. Overall, total deposits grew to a record $17.5 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 7% for the year and
$245 million from the linked quarter. We maintain our favorable deposit mix. 90% of deposits are in non-time
accounts. 36% of total deposits are in noninterest-bearing accounts, and our deposit pricing strategy continues to
serve us well. In the fourth quarter, core deposit costs were 44 basis points and total deposit costs 74 basis
points. For detail on our deposit beta, please see page 23 of the investor deck.
Turning to key credit metrics. Our disciplined credit approach is delivering excellent credit quality across our
portfolios. Delinquency ratio is at a historic low of 4 basis points. Nonperforming loans represented 51 basis
points of total loans. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained low at 33 basis points.
Nonpass-rated loans decreased to 44.7% from 5.3% in the linked quarter. Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we had net
loan recoveries of $1.7 million.
We continue to take a conservative credit approach, given concerns around the current economic environment.
Despite some headwinds, we've sustained momentum, we're executing our strategies, and we're delivering
record revenue, record organic loan growth, record customer acquisition, improved credit quality, expanded net
interest margin, and a lower efficiency ratio.
We're doing all this, while consolidating our bank charters. In 2022, we successfully executed five bank charter
consolidations with our banks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, and Minnesota becoming divisions of HTLF
Bank. Transitions have been smooth and the project continues on schedule and on budget. We expect to finish
charter consolidation early in the fourth quarter of 2023 and deliver $20 million of annual savings and capacity
after the project is complete. Bryan will share more details in his comments.
We also continue to optimize our branch network. In 2022, we reduced our number of total branches by 8% to
119 total locations. In alignment with HTLF Bank's Colorado Charter, as of January 1, HTLF's corporate
headquarters is now in Denver. Geographic diversity is a strength of HTLF. We have 11 markets in 12 states with
Denver as our largest market. HTLF's corporate headquarters in Denver reinforces our presence in and
commitment to growth markets. We are committed to our strong and sizable presence in Dubuque, Iowa, where
17% of our employees are located. HTLF operational and administrative functions will continue to be largely
staffed and run from Dubuque.
As I look back on 2022, it was a year of significant growth and tremendous accomplishment for HTLF. We
continue to execute our strategies, grow our business, operate more efficiently, deliver strong results and, most
importantly, serve our customers and communities. This is all the result of the hard work and dedication of HTLF's
employees. I want to recognize and thank them for their continued commitment to delivering strength, insight, and
growth to our customers, communities, investors, and each other. We move forward together because, together,
we are HTLF.

I'll now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and
financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. As Bruce just outlined, this was another strong quarter for HTLF with
earnings per share of $1.37, loan growth of just over $500 million, revenue growth this quarter of over $10 million,
and stable, clean credit performance.
Included in this quarter's results were three large notable items. First, $2.4 million of losses on the sale or write-
down of assets [ph] which were primarily facilities (00:15:34) related; second, charter consolidation restructure
costs $2.4 million; and third, shareholder dispute resolution costs of over $1 million. Together, these items
decreased pre-tax net income by more than $5.8 million and earnings per share by $0.11. Before I go into more
detail, I want to remind everyone that our fourth quarter earnings release and investor presentations are both
available in the IR section of HTLF's website.
So, I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which totaled $3.4 million that's a $2.1 million
decrease over last quarter. This quarter, the provision reflects our strong loan growth, continued stable, healthy
credit performance, and an economic outlook that anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next 12
months. In addition, the provision benefited from $1.7 million of net loan loss recoveries.
At quarter-end, the allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for credit losses
on loans and unfunded commitments, increased $5.1 million to $129.7 million or 1.13% of total loans. In addition,
at quarter-end, unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled just over $10 million or 9 basis
points of loans.
Moving to investments. Investments remained flat at $7 billion, representing 35% of assets, with a tax-equivalent
yield of 3.45%, and will generate cash flows exceeding $1 billion over the next 12 months. We continued to
actively manage the portfolio by taking several actions during the quarter. First, we utilized nearly $65 million of
cash flow this quarter to fund loan growth and; second, we took advantage of some mid-quarter market disruption
and reinvested $115 million of cash flow into a AAA-rated security with a purchase yield of nearly 9% and a
duration of less than a year.
With regards to capital, regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier 1 at just over 11% and
total risk-based just over 14.75%. The tangible common equity ratio reversed a several-quarter decline,
increasing 27 basis points to 5.21% at quarter-end. The rise in market value of investments this quarter
contributed 15 basis points of the increase.
Moving to the income statement. Starting with revenue, net interest income totaled $165.2 million this quarter,
which was $9.3 million higher than the prior quarter, and the net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis rose 20
basis points this quarter to 3.65%. The main drivers of the increase were our strong loan growth and asset-
sensitive balance sheet and the Fed's short-term interest rate increases.
This quarter, the net interest margin includes 3 basis points of purchase accounting accretion, which is
unchanged from the prior quarter. Noninterest income of $30 million this quarter was $800,000 higher than the
prior quarter. Excluding security losses, core noninterest income was $30.1 million, which was at the high-end of
5

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2023
our $29 million to $30 million forecast. So, in total, quarterly revenue grew $10 million or 5% and exceeded
expectations.
Shifting to expenses. Noninterest expense totaled $117.2 million this quarter. That's up $8.3 million from last
quarter. Excluding restructuring, tax credit costs, and asset gains and losses, the run rate of recurring operating
expenses increased $3.1 million to $109.1 million, compared to $106 million last quarter and exceeded our
forecast of $105 million to $106 million.
Operating expenses were higher than anticipated in Q4, primarily due to legal and other cost reimbursements
related to the resolution of a shareholder group dispute and higher incentive compensation accruals due to
stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and loan growth. As a result of the strong revenue growth this quarter,
the fourth quarter efficiency ratio improved to 54.33% from 55.26% last quarter.
Now, looking ahead to 2023, HTLF expects to see continued success and improvement, highlighted by expected
loan growth of 6% to 8% next year with $150 million to $200 million expected next quarter. Deposit growth is
expected to be 3% to 5% next year, with Q1 expected to show nominal growth. Investment cash flow will be
utilized to fund the gap between loan growth and deposit growth. Net interest income for Q1 will be down versus
Q4 due to two fewer days in the quarter. Full year, net interest income will be much higher than 2022. That
reflects our higher net interest margin and larger balance sheet. However, the magnitude of the increase will be
dependent upon future Fed rate moves and deposit pricing, which are difficult to predict at this time.
Provision for credit losses are projected to range from $4 million to $6 million per quarter, given projected loan
growth and assuming credit trends begin to normalize from their current levels. However, declines in economic
conditions and projections could significantly impact future provisions, if a worse-than-moderate recession
develops. Core noninterest income, that is excluding investment gains and losses, is expected to be $28 million to
$29 million next quarter and is projected to raise 4% to 5% on a full year basis, as persistently weaker mortgage
revenue is offset by growth in other income categories, primarily commercial fees.
Recurring operating expenses are expected to be $108 million to $109 million next quarter, and show a 2% to 3%
increase on a full-year basis. This includes the impact of an increase in FDIC cost of $3 million to $4 million for
the full year. Charter consolidation restructuring costs are expected to be $2 million to $2.5 million next quarter. In
total, we estimate the remaining cost to complete the project will approach $10 million over the next four quarters.
And finally, we believe a tax rate of 22% to 23%, excluding new tax credits, is a reasonable run rate.
So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions and answers.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now conduct our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is open.

Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Bryan, thanks for all the financial outlook. Maybe if I could just ask a question. The $20 million of benefits from
the charter consolidation, could you remind me, is that all on the expense side? And then maybe, if we just take a
step back, could you give us a few real-world examples of the benefits of the charter consolidation outside of the
numbers? And maybe, just to finish the thought there, has there been any impact on local decision making, or
even the perception that things have changed there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Bryan, let me maybe answer or give some comments on Terry's last question. There is absolutely no
impact on local decision making, not only the perception, but there's actually no impact. The decisions that our
local CEOs and leadership teams were able to make pre-charter consolidation and post-charter consolidation are
exactly the same. So, there's absolutely no change there, and it's actually gone very, very, very smoothly. Bryan,
why don't you talk a little bit about the real-world examples of not just the expense side, but the actual changes,
because your area has a lot of that benefit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think there's certainly internal efficiencies that we'll gain, Terry, for example, not doing as many call
reports. That's a simple one, right. But we also manage multiple investment portfolios. We'll eventually only need
to manage one. Same with liquidity, maintaining liquidity at 11 banks versus 1. So there's a lot in finance. There's
7

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2023
– throughout the operations side, [ph] Rego (00:25:52) doesn't have to be reported as much. There's some
compliance things that help as well. So there's lots of those things.
I think, additionally for customers, it will be easier for them to bank at any one of our locations across the footprint,
easier than it is today. And so, there are customer benefits as well. In terms of the $20 million efficiency gain in
terms of dollars, it's really in a couple, maybe two or three places. The predominant places is expense savings. As
you can probably see, our FTE count is down already; whether we have to replace some of that, but we certainly
won't have to replace it, I don't think, all back to the levels that we were before because it will become more
efficient. So there's some cost take-outs for not having to do certain things, but there's going to be efficiency gains
as well, where we won't have to add back people, even if we continue to grow.
And maybe the third and this is probably the smaller one is, there's probably some efficiencies in the treasury
area, just with when we do exercise some of our trades, they're probably bigger blocks and we can maybe get a
little bit better execution. So – oh, one other thing [indiscernible] (00:27:12) one big benefit that we get internally is
we don't have to participate loans back and forth between banks. And we spend a lot of time in the operations
area and in the finance area kind of sorting that out and we put it all together, but then keeping the bank separate.
So, Bruce, anything else to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Just two other things, and I want to piggyback on what Bryan just said about the internal loan participations
between our charters. One of the real benefits of the banks that we've already consolidated is that their balance
sheet and, therefore, their income statement now actually reflects the work that they've done; where before, if
they had made a loan and it was participated, only the amount of the loan that was not participated remained on
their balance sheet.
So, they're actually now getting the full benefit for everything they're doing, whether it's originating loans or on the
deposit side, they're getting the benefit of the deposits if others are using those deposits to fund loans, so that.
And then also, we had to manage capital at 11 different charters in the past, where now, you don't have to do that.
So those are just some of the kind of the non-expense side, but the real benefits in how we operate going
forward, Terry. Thanks for the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for all the color there. And then as a follow-up, on the deposit side, what's that, $800 million of
brokered CDs at $3.95. Can you just talk about how long you expect those to be on the balance sheet? Is it kind
of a one-year type product? And maybe, what's our deposit beta good going forward from here? It's been
relatively low so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Bryan, why don't you take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think the $800 million of brokered CDs, I believe, are all less than a year, and I think they're
predominantly less than six months. So, they're not long CDs, Terry. And then our deposit betas and you probably

can see in the deck that there's been about 14 or 15 basis points or beta in the fourth quarter. I think those will
move up a little bit. It wouldn't surprise me if we saw another 5 to 10 ticks on that beta. It just – we're having to do
a little bit of catchup, but we've moved pretty close to the mark, but we're going to move a little bit more to stay
with the market. And on our commercial side, we have been making decisions all along that we need to make to
make sure that we maintain our customers and are open to what relationships we have to customers to price
appropriately.

DelMonte with KBW. Your line is open.

Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good evening, guys. Hope you guys are all doing well today, and thanks for taking my questions. Just
wanted to ask a little bit about the margin, Bryan. I heard the commentary that NII will be down on a lower day
count in part. Just kind of wondering where you see the margin peaking, if you think it's a first quarter event or a
second quarter event, and kind of how you look at the cadence of the margin throughout the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Now, that's probably the toughest question I'm going to get today just because...
[indiscernible] (00:31:09)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...but let me take it in chunks. I would say, the first quarter here, our margin, I would say, without any fed moves,
would probably stay just slightly below the 3.65% that we posted. I think, as I said, there's some latent beta
catchup here that I think happened in December and maybe even early January. So, I think we'll fight without any
Fed help to stay there.
Now, if the Fed raises, like everybody thinks, 25 basis points in a couple of days, we'll get a little bit of benefit from
that, but not nearly like we were getting before. And I think the deposit betas are going to continue to ratchet up a
bit. So, we might get a tick or two there. So, I would say, all-in, we're going to stay somewhere in the first quarter
between 3.60% for sure and maybe 3.65% on the top end. For the full year, if the Fed doesn't reduce rates in the
last half of the year, maybe we get one additional, so we get two bumps instead of one, I think we can stay above
3.60%. But we probably are close to topping out. Now, we might go up a little bit with the Fed move, but I think
we're going to slide back down. So, we might touch a little bit higher, but I think we're going to bounce around this
3.65% to 3.70% maybe once in a while, but then, I think, long term, we're in the 3.60s.

Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to the outlook for loan growth, I think
you said like 6% to 8%, are you seeing greater opportunities on the C&I side or the CRE side, or is it kind of
equally weighted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. This is Bruce. Let me take that, and then I'll ask Nathan to weigh in since he sees everything. I think there's
more opportunity right now on the C&I side. And our agribusiness group is also generating a lot of opportunity.
There's some activity clearly on the real estate side, particularly in the industrial space. Some of the warehousing,
some distribution, and a couple of the markets still has some multifamily activity going on.
Nathan, do you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Bruce. I would fully concur. I think the opportunities really do show themselves on the C&I side. And then
where we're seeing opportunity on CRE and being very strategic, we do see some good opportunities there as
they're coming about, but they're just not as prevalent as they had been historically. [ph] Currently, we're just
watching it a (00:33:43) little bit tighter now and taking precautions appropriate for sizing and doing sensitivity to
make sure that they'll perform through the cycle.

Hey, Damon. [indiscernible] (00:34:18). Just to add maybe on to that office though. Nathan, you might add where
those offices are typically located, because I think office can be a very general term. Is it downtown, high-rise
office space? Is it more low-rise suburban? Could you give a little bit of that color, Nathan? Because I think that
would help everybody on the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Just by nature of kind of where we're located in our footprint, we really stay kind of more
focused outside of the central business districts, and more focused kind of in a suburban office kind of really
looking at more of a granular portfolio, multi-tenant nature, amortizing, and we think, very well underwritten. So,
so far, we feel very good about where we're at, but we are watching in very diligently and kind of continuing to
stay in front of it, talking with our customers, and making sure that we understand kind of where they're at. And
so, we can make those decisions earlier. But from that perspective, we do feel that the performance today still

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe one for Nathan. Just wanted to – the type of loans that were, I guess, resolved
out of nonaccrual in the quarter, I think around $6 million net, but just wanted to kind of get a sense for what was
recovered?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. We – it's really – there wasn't any area of significance. The recovery was really on a credit that
we had in agriculture from really several years back, just due to the really great work done by our special assets
group to stay with it, was really able to see through and get some recoveries there. But from the nonperforming
perspective, kind of how that's been going, we just continue to work it down. I wouldn't say there's any one area
specifically we could call out as being systemic as we're working through it. It's just the overall book itself. We
continue to work hard to make sure we're getting out of those credits and getting them either; A, back into our
performing line of business, or helping them find a different bank or opportunities for them going forward.

...change – sorry, Bruce. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No, I was just going to provide a little more color. Jeff, the recovery was on a loan that had been previously fully
charged off. So, it didn't have any – that was not connected to the decrease in our nonaccrual loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Right. Yeah. I kind of flubbed the question there. I was really looking for the direction of nonaccrual. I got you. But,
I think, Nathan [indiscernible] (00:37:12) overly specific, it's been just continued work, and kind of the follow on
was there's no change in aggressiveness. It's not as if this mild recession is upon us, you didn't change gears
and/or anything. It's just working those credits and just got, like you said, nondescript reductions in nonaccruals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Correct.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And just a follow on, maybe for Bryan, did that recovery impact the margin at all? Was there anything in there that
you'd say that kind of non-core, or just the 3.65%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. No, there was no interest recovery. It was all principal recovery. This one – Jeff, just for a little bit of color,
this one was one of the loans that we charged off coming into the COVID. We had a couple of big charge-offs,
and as we entered COVID, I think it was back from that time. So it's been like almost 2.5, 3 years since we took
the charge-off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. Great. Thanks. And just jumping over on topics to the expense side, I wanted to make sure I got the
$108 million to $109 million and, Bryan, you said 2% to 3% full year growth, correct?

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A

Correct. Yeah. It excludes those items. I always exclude the charter restructuring, any tax credit costs from last

Bryan, do you do you have a 2022 core expense number? Relative to the [ph] $443,000 (00:39:18), like what
would be the core?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A

Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Following up on the expenses here. Just looking in, once the charter conversion is complete – charter
consolidation is complete, you have the cost savings in there. Has there been any – have you looked out and
seen what other investments in the franchise you expect to make? Are any of these savings going to be
redeployed, or do you think they're all going to follow the bottom line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Andrew. I think that's a really great question, and I would anticipate that, as I'm thinking about it, over half
of them will probably redeploy into the charter with products or potentially some geographic expansion. But it's
really where the opportunities are. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. That's helpful there. And then, on both the growth for this year, 3% to 5.5% deposit growth, I guess,
where is that deposit growth coming from? I would imagine it's not on the wholesale side, like you had here this
last quarter, but what's giving you the confidence that 3% to 5% is achievable in this tougher environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We think it'll come from the commercial side and the small business side, where we've been generating a
lot of new business and new opportunities. We think the consumer side, honestly, will probably be flattish as we're
just now starting to see the average balances in our consumer accounts start to decrease. You've heard us talk in
the past that those extra balances during the pandemic, they were holding steady. We just saw them start to
decrease for the first time during the fourth quarter.
So, our goal is to generate enough new business to offset that decrease on the consumer side, and we think that
we'll be able to grow the commercial and the business banking and small business side on a go-forward basis.
And we would have done that this year, except we did have a significant commercial operational outflows in the
quarter that I referenced.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hello. I wanted to circle back to the discussion on the deposit base and, Bryan, you gave some good color, so
appreciate it. But just, as you're looking out to the rest of this year, noninterest-bearing, I think we're at about
32%. Where do you think that ends the year? And do you have a rough deposit beta all in that you're using for
your outlook for this year as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Bryan, do you want to take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think our DDAs are 36% the way we calculate them. I don't know if maybe you've got average balances or
something, Dave, but I think it's 36%. But that's down a little bit from where it was. So, that has moved a little bit
this year with the way deposits have flowed. So, we think that that can probably solidify, and some of that outflow
that we saw at the end of the quarter was out of DDA in the commercial side. So, hopefully, some of that will flow
a little bit and build back.
And I think the new customers that Bruce is talking about, if we're successful in bringing in C&I customers, which
we have been, those tend to be more DDA and noninterest-bearing accounts. So, I think there, we can hold our
own and maybe grow just a little bit on the DDA side, and certainly grow the non-maturity deposits in total. Betas
that we...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And we think, Dave...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, Bruce.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'll finish with the betas, and then you can jump in and add some color. I was just going to say, our betas that we
model are typically around 25% to 30% on the non-maturity and probably around 80% on the CDs kind of blends
together for something in the mid-30s for overall betas. Now, we've been doing better than that. Particularly, we
did better than that in the first, probably 250-basis-point move, where we didn't move much, if any. So, I still think
we have some catchup, which is why I think our margin is not going to go a lot higher, and it's going to kind of
tread water here, because we're probably going to be having some catchup on those betas if you're going
forward.

Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. David, I was just going to mention on that commercial deposit growth. That will also help us on the treasury
management fee side, because those operating accounts of all those new relationships, we're able to provide
them with our products that we have on the treasury management side, as well as those C&I customers are using
more of our capital markets products, whether they're swapping their floating rate loans which, this quarter, 79%
of our loans were floating, which is an all-time high for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for the additional color. And then, just the last thing I want to ask is back to the deposit side. Within
your footprint, very broad-based footprint, do you notice any material differences in deposit pricing within your
footprint? Are you getting better pricing out West, maybe in the Midwest, maybe Texas? I guess, the question
specifically would be, where do you see the least amount of deposit competition and where do you see the most
competition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the Midwest always has had more competition than the West. I mean, that's been the history, and you've
heard us talk about that in the past. But I would tell you the one market that probably we do the best in is in New
Mexico. That would – and it's not so much that there's no competition. It's just – we've got a great team out there.
They've been there a long time. And there aren't as many credit unions as an example out there. Where we are
seeing the highest competition is where there is significant credit union activity, which also tends to be in the
Midwest.

record total revenue of $726 million, a 5% increase, record loan growth of $1.6 billion or 17%, excluding PPP. Our
fourth quarter efficiency ratio decreased 15% from a year ago to 54.33%. Our credit quality continues to be
excellent and improving. And we have increased the dividend on our common stock to a record $0.30 per share,
all while seamlessly executing charter consolidation to deliver improved customer experience, efficiency, and
unlock capacity for future growth. Our strong momentum continues into 2023, and we are well-positioned to
continue driving growth. Thank you for joining us tonight. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late April. Have
