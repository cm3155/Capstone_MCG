Lynn B. Fuller
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon, and welcome to Heartland's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We
appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance for the first quarter of 2020. For
the next few minutes I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the call over to Heartland's President
and CEO, Bruce Lee who will cover progress on business performance and our COVID-19 response. Then, Bryan
McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around Heartland's results. While during these very
challenging times, our priority has been the safety of our employees and the ongoing support of our customers

and communities. I think it's nothing short of amazing how well we have been able to support our clients' ongoing
financial needs without putting our employees' safety and health at risk. Bruce will provide more detail on the
many things we have done to support protect and care for our employees, customers and communities.
Now onto the financial highlights for the first quarter of 2020 that we're significantly impacted by our
implementation of CECL and a declining economic outlook, both of which led to significant build in credit loss
reserves. When you look at Q1 net income and related financial performance ratios, on a tax-effected pre-
provision acquisition, integration and restructuring cost basis, we really had a pretty good quarter. As a result,
these calculations are included as new tables in this quarter's press release to show the impact of these items on
earnings.
So our first quarter net income available to common shareholders was $20 million that compared to Q1 2019 of
$31.5 million. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.54 compared to $0.91. However, net income available
to common shareholders on a tax-effected pre-provision acquisition, integration and restructuring cost basis was
$38.1 million compared to Q1 2019 of $35.6 million, which results in earnings per diluted common share of $1.03
for both Q1 2020 and 2019. Return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was 8% and 14.46% on a
tax-effected pre-provision acquisition, integration and restructuring cost basis.
Well, assets ended the quarter at $13.3 billion compared to Q1 2019 of $11.3 billion, an increase of nearly 18%.
Non-time deposit growth for the first quarter was strong at $212 million, and Bruce will cover both deposits and
loans in his comments. Our net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis at 3.84% held up reasonably well.
That said it did decrease from 4.18% for the same quarter last year.
Our efficiency ratio continues to improve as expenses have been well controlled with this quarter at 61.82%
compared to 64.93% for Q1 2019. Both value and tangible book value this quarter were at $42.21 and $28.84
respectively, an increase over Q1 2019 of 6% and 7% respectively. As a result of our tangible common equity
ratio ended the quarter at 8.29% compared to 8.6% for Q1 2019.
Well, on the M&A front in February, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AIM Bancshares Inc., and
its wholly-owned subsidiary AimBank anticipated closing will be in the third quarter with AimBank a $1.8 billion
asset bank merged with and into Heartland's Lubbock Texas-based subsidiary First Bank & Trust. This
combination creates Heartland's largest independent bank charter with $2.8 billion in assets. The fifth largest bank
headquartered in West Texas and the third largest deposit market share bank in Lubbock. Also this transaction
adds six New Mexico branches with $250 million in assets to Heartland's New Mexico charter increasing New
Mexico Bank & Trust assets to $2 billion. The largest bank headquartered in New Mexico with the fifth largest
deposit share in the state.
With respect to concerns regarding bank stock dividends resulting from the impact of COVID-19, our plans are to
maintain our quarterly dividend. As a result, I'm pleased to report that last week Heartland's board of directors
approved $0.20 per common share dividend payable May 29, 2020 to shareholders of record May 15, 2020.
In closing, I'd like to remind everyone that Heartland was recognized as a Forbes' Best Bank in 2020. This is the
fifth time Forbes included us in their best bank list which ranks the 100 largest publicly traded banks and thrifts
based on growth, credit quality, efficiency and profitability. Overall, Heartland was ranked 40th in the nation.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President and CEO who will provide an overview of the
company's operated performance, COVID-19 response and credit. Bruce?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon everyone. As we began 2020, we could not have imagined that we would be
reporting first quarter results as we are battling a worldwide pandemic. During this challenging time, we have
been focused on the health and well-being of our employees, our customers and the communities we call home.
In January, I shared that Heartland has never been a stronger franchise or better prepared for the future. Our
business model is designed to endure challenging times. Our diverse geographic footprint reduces risk and
contributes to our strong financial metrics that reflects our conservative liquidity profile, healthy capital levels,
diverse loan portfolio and solid credit metrics. Heartland's financial strength has enabled us to care for our
employees, provide relief for our customers and help ease the hardships facing our communities. This afternoon I
will share key highlights of our performance, credit metrics and the actions we have taken in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. And then I will turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Heartland's Chief Financial Officer who
will provide more details on the financials.
We had significant momentum coming out of the fourth quarter and I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter
we continued to deliver deposit and loan growth. We delivered $77 million in commercial loan growth during the
first quarter with 6 of our 11 banks delivering growth. Our agricultural portfolio declined approximately $16 million.
Residential and consumer loans decreased by $54 million from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the current
mortgage refinancing environment. Bill Callahan and the Arizona Bank & Trust team delivered $51 million of loan
growth and are building strong relationships and have become the lender of choice for customers who are taking
advantage of the attractive investment opportunities afforded by opportunity zones. Citywide Banks in Denver and
Minnesota Bank & Trust also delivered impressive commercial loan growth.
Turning to deposits, customers saw at safe havens for market volatility. We did not experience the seasonal
deposit declines we have seen in the past. We had a strong quarter of growth including $212 million of non-time
growth. Deposit growth was evenly split between our retail and commercial lines of business. Minnesota Bank &
Trust and Arizona Bank & Trust reported the strongest deposit growth. We were prepared to respond when the
Fed cut interest rates. In the first quarter, the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 79 basis points,
down 12 basis points from the previous quarter. This response along with our previously implemented interest
rate floors on commercial loans enabled us to increase core interest margin by 2 basis points.
Turning to credit metrics, I am pleased to report that we continue to see stable credit quality in the first quarter.
Our non-performing loans represented 95 basis points of total loans at the end of the first quarter, which remains
flat when compared to 96 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter. Overall, non-performing assets as a
percent of total assets decreased slightly from 66 basis points in the fourth quarter to 64 basis points in the first
quarter. Other real estate also decreased from $69 million to $61 million over the same period. The delinquency
ratio increased slightly from 33 basis points in the fourth quarter to 38 basis points in the first quarter.
Non-pass rated loans improved from 6.7% in the fourth quarter to 6.4% in the first quarter and compares
favorably to the levels over the past several years. Lastly, net loan charge-offs for the first quarter were reported
at $5 million or 24 basis points for the quarter, which was slightly elevated due to [ph] one, $3.2 million (00:13:06)
charge-off of a commercial loan that was previously fully reserved. Last year, I shared the tremendous progress
made on our company wide strategic initiative that streamlined our processes, better aligned our people and
invested in and implemented best-in-class technology, Customer Compass.
In 2019, we invested in technology across our customer service centers. We implemented advanced self-serve
options to provide additional convenience to consumer customers. We introduced a new online banking platform
for commercial customers. We adopted a best-in-class technology loan origination platform and we installed a

new customer relationship management system. The investments we made in 2019 have made us faster,
stronger and more efficient. We significantly improved our efficiency ratio by 310 basis points year-over-year and
we have held salary expenses flat for the past nine quarters as we've increased our assets by more than $3.2
billion. Operating Customer Compass also prepared us for the dramatic shifts in customer behavior we've
experienced over the past 45 days.
Online account openings grew 12% in 2019 to 42% during the first quarter. We have seen a 17% increase in
online and mobile bank usage and a 40% decrease in branch transactions. And we've seen the use of self-serve
balance and transaction inquiries double. And in the days following stimulus checks being issued, we saw it
quadrupled.
Heartland acted quickly in early March and activated our pandemic and business continuity plans. Weeks before
the CARES Act was passed, we had already implemented several measures to protect and care for our
employees and customers. We restricted business travel and canceled all employee and customer in-person
events. We closed bank lobbies, implemented drive-through only and deep cleaned our locations. We enabled
two-thirds, more than 1,200 members of our workforce to work from home. We introduced a pandemic time-off
program and committed to pay all employees at 100% through May 31. And if an employee needs time-off
because of illness, to care for a sick family member or to provide childcare due to school closings they'll be paid,
covering 100% of any COVID-19 related medical expenses for testing or treatment. We're paying a 20% premium
to certain customer facing retail employees in banks and call centers and we're engaging with our employees,
providing information and resources through enriched communications and wellness programs.
We also proactively implemented relief efforts for our consumer, small business and commercial customers. For
consumer customers, we're waiving maintenance fees on consumer checking and savings accounts. We're also
waiving for an ATM transaction fees. Our customers will not pay any early redemption penalties on CDs and we're
allowing customers to make interest only payments on installment loans and not assessing late fees for 90 days.
Our small business customers can modify their loans to make interest only payments for 90 days. And for 90
days, our small business customers can skip payments on their credit cards. We are working individually with our
commercial customers to help them address the financial challenges they are facing. As of April 23, we've made
modifications to $513 million of loans, representing 7% of our commercial portfolio.
Of those modifications 68% are paying interest only for 90 days and the remaining 32% deferred principal and
interest for 90 days. These modifications reflect our disciplined underwriting practices. For more information, I'd
refer you to slides we've posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. These slides detail COVID-19
affected customer segments, geographic distribution, loan size and underwriting standards.
Today the COVID-19 pandemic is a health crisis across our country. Hardships are being created for certain
customer segments, will pose significant credit challenges as we head into the second half of the year. We're
proactively taking steps to help our customers stabilize their positions. We've added experienced leadership and
tripled the resources in our special assets group so we are in a strong position to help customers navigate a path
forward.
Next, I would like to discuss our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program. Congress passed the CARES
Act on Friday, March 27. Just one week later on Friday, April 3, our banks were among the first in the country to
begin taking requests for the newly created SBA Paycheck Protection Program. We quickly built a streamlined
automated process to collect and authenticate information and began the PPP application process.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
During the first wave of the PPP program, we have processed over 3,000 applications and funded over $1 billion
in loans. The 1,800 employees across Heartland and our member banks are proud to have served our small
businesses and helped to preserve over 100,000 jobs. We're actively participating in the second wave of the
program that opened today. We also recognize that our communities need us now more than ever. And we have
deepened our commitment to sharing our time, talent and treasures. In April, Heartland and our member banks
contributed $1.2 million to non-profit organizations across the states where we live and work. We are donating
funds to organizations that are working directly with those affected by COVID-19. We need to work together to
address the impacts of this pandemic.
We also need to work together to safely reopen our communities and our economy. Heartland's diverse
geographic footprint will allow us to reopen our branches gradually and in phases. First Bank in Texas and Rocky
Mountain Bank in Montana will be our first banks to begin to reopen branches this week. It may be some time
before restrictions are lifted in other states allowing us to reopen branches and resume full operations. This
gradual state-by-state roll out allows us to share key learning and best practices from each location as we
cautiously expand in-person service to our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan McKeag for more detail on our quarterly financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll begin my comments today by referencing the press release,
which shows our reported earnings per share of [ph] $0.54 (00:21:53) per share this quarter. This includes $21.5
million CECL provision for credit losses and $1.4 million of acquisition and integration costs. And excluding these
two items, our earnings per share was $1.3.
For the quarter other significant non-core items consisted of a mortgage loan servicing right valuation write-down
of $1.6 million and $400,000 of incremental COVID related expenses. So again this quarter core results were
solid with financial trends and metrics also positive in most aspects.
Now, before I go on to cover the balance sheet and income statement, I'm going to cover CECL right upfront. The
initial day one CECL adoption impact resulted in a $12.1 million increase in the allowance for funded loans and
$13.6 million increase in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments for a total of $25.7 million or a 37%
increase to our existing credit loss reserves, which after tax also resulted in a 10 basis point decline in our
tangible common equity ratio. This was right in line with the range we discussed on our last call and as disclosed
in our recent 10-K.
Our first CECL provision this quarter was $21.5 million and substantially all of the provision was related to the
significant deterioration in the economic forecasts since the beginning of the year due to the effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic. In total, the day one adjustment and quarterly provision, net of $5 million in net charge-offs resulted
in a reserve build during the first quarter of $42.2 million which represents a 60% increase from the year-end
reserves. At quarter end, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $97.4 million or 1.16% of total loans and
the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was $15.5 million or 19 basis points of total loans.
Together, these two allowances result in a total allowance for lending related credit losses of $112.8 million or
1.35% of total loans.
This reserve bill that I just discussed reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment, considering
the effects of COVID-19 and the impacts from the various government stimulus programs, along with a
heightened management risk assessment given the volatility and uncertainty that exists, surrounding forecasts in

this current economic environment. We utilized the March 27 consensus macro-economic baseline forecast from
Moody's as our most likely economic scenario. As the economic outlook evolves and our pandemic-related loss
profiles and experience develops, we will adjust our allowance for credit losses and provisioning accordingly.
Okay, now let's move on to the rest of the balance sheet where total assets grew $85 million during the quarter to
end the quarter at approximately $13.3 billion with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74%. The tangible common equity
ratio declined from 8.52% last quarter to 8.29% and includes the impact of our initial CECL Day 1 adjustment
which reduced the ratio by 10 basis points and an 18-basis-point reduction due to the change in fair value marks
on our bond portfolio. Excluding these two items, the ratio would have increased 5 basis points to 8.57%.
Investments also grew $180 million this quarter and comprised 27% of assets with a tax equivalent yield of
2.88%, a duration of just under six years and generate $43 million of monthly cash flow. Total borrowings remain
low at $398 million or 3% of assets. At March 31, our banking network had approximately $2.5 billion of unused
borrowing capacity.
So we believe that Heartland's balance sheet with strong capital and loss reserves combined with ample liquidity
and low leverage, provides sufficient strength – significant strength and positions us well to successfully navigate
through the turbulent economic times ahead.
Moving onto the income statement, net interest income totaled $112.5 million this quarter or $234,000 lower
compared to the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.84% which
was just below the 3.85% to 3.9% range we indicated last quarter. The decline of 6 basis points from last quarter
included a 16-basis-point decline in loan yields due to lower purchase accounting accretion and the Fed's rate
cuts during the quarter.
The lower loan yields were largely offset by lower interest costs on deposits and borrowings which decreased 13
basis points compared to last quarter. This quarter the net interest margin includes 9 basis points of purchase
accounting accretion compared to 17 basis points in the prior quarter. As a result, the margin net of purchase
accounting increased 2 basis points over last quarter.
Noninterest income totaled $25.8 million for the quarter, down $2.2 million from last quarter. Significant items
include trust fees and brokerage and insurance commissions, which were affected by the significant downturn that
occurred in the market halfway through the quarter, combined, these line items declined $450,000 or 7% from last
quarter. Gain on the sale of loans was up $1.3 million on higher loan refinance activity. We also recorded a $1.6
million write-down on loan servicing rights, reflecting faster mortgage prepayments speeds.
Moving to noninterest expense. Total noninterest expense was $90.9 million this quarter, down $2 million
compared to last quarter. This quarter, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $1.4 million compared to
$500,000 last quarter.
So on a core run rate basis, our costs that exclude acquisition, integration, restructuring costs, tax credit costs
and asset gains and losses totaled $89.3 million compared to $87.8 million last quarter or a $1.5 million increase.
This is due to the resumption of our FDIC insurance accruals and an increased cost for equipment required to
provide work from home capabilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
More specifically, salary and benefits were flat compared to last quarter, as salary costs declined on fewer FTEs
but were offset by increases in some benefit costs and mortgage-related commissions. Occupancy, furniture and
fixture expenses combined rose $500,000, primarily due to the increased costs for COVID-19.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Professional fees increased $1.4 million, primarily due to the resumption of FDIC insurance accruals, which
accounted for $1.2 million of the increase. The remaining expense categories were relatively flat compared to last
quarter. The efficiency ratio was 61.82% for the quarter which is over 300 basis points better than the same
quarter last year and better than the 63% to 64% range we indicated on our last call. The reported effective tax
rate for the quarter was 22.77% compared to 20.88% same quarter last year and was slightly higher than the 22%
we indicated on our last call.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Bruce.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Bryan. Before I resume my comments, I need to clean up an error, I made in my comments related to
other real estate. I should have said decreased from $6.9 million to $6.1 million over the same period. I think I
said $69 million and $61 million. So before Bryan fell out of his chair, I wanted to make that correction.
Banding together, we will survive this pandemic. Across Heartland, we have become even more collaborative,
more agile and more customer focused. Every day, we are deepening our bonds with each other, our customers
and our communities. Heartland has built a fortress balance sheet, and we have the financial strength to weather
this storm. When this storm subsides, we recognize that the landscape will forever be changed.
We're already looking to the future, anticipating the emerging needs of our employees and our customers. We will
continue looking to the future, anticipating the needs of our customers. We'll continue to have our compass
pointed forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Josh, we can now open the phone lines for questions from our analysts.

On the capital again, could you remind us what – or an updated number on pro forma TCE should the AIM close
in Q3?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's one I wasn't ready for. Let me dig a little bit if you want to ask next question – Jeff, I've got it here. I think
I've got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. I think maybe just broadly speaking if you talk about if there's some impact there, just general comfortability
levels, I think, much talked about maintaining the dividend is the plan and just kind of where the comfort levels
are? Should that be as that flushes out even post deal? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think I'm looking here but I believe that where we thought would be, would be about 8.4% projected. And I
think that was maybe getting through the end of the year, so I think that had a little bit of earnings added with AIM
coming in. The only difference I would say that's probably different now is the 18 basis points that we lost due to
the devaluation in the bond portfolio this quarter.

We anticipated the 10 basis points that we were going to lose from CECL that was already in. Yeah, and so then
we'll have to see what happens with COVID and how we go forward but that's – so we thought AIM, I think, was
going to keep us relatively flat on our metrics after you took down a 10 basis points that we knew about for CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay and then – thanks for the detail on your current exposure. I think, could you speak to what AIM has
got on its books in terms of a similar level of – cross-section of the loan portfolio, I guess, at risk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, this is Bruce. Our look at the AIM portfolio, we haven't done the same deep dive that we've done here.
We've been really focused with AIM around the impact of the oil and gas which they really have very little in the
way of direct exposure but because of what's going on in Odessa, Midland and other parts of West Texas, we
think that it's going to be, how they're affected will be much greater.
What I saw was Midland was number one and Odessa was number eight in communities affected by COVID-
related industries with both of them over 40%. So we haven't taken the deep dive but what we have seen is the
markets that they're operating in are severely impacted by COVID-19.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then one last one on the – just on the credit side, it sounded like on that commercial loan that
led to the – kind of the largest part of the charge-offs that that was fully reserved for us so that makes me think
that wasn't COVID related but could you clarify, kind of, what drove that charge-off there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, that charge-off was definitely not COVID related and it came to us through one of our acquisitions and it
was fully reserved and so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We've been dealing with it for multiple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Right, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Hey guys, good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Hi. I know it's tough to give too much guidance at this point but it seems like just on the expense side, a lot of
things are trending the way that you guys suggested a quarter ago. So is this a good run rate to build off,
recognizing there could be some one-time COVID events in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think, generally, we would be aiming to keep it flat and probably without COVID, we'd probably working to
get it down, but that may be a little more difficult. We will have – just for some bumps that maybe you won't think –
don't think about. We do have our merit increases which we will be giving employees here in April, have already
begun. And then, I think it really comes down to the COVID and the credit-related costs that we'll have to incur.
How much those are? We aren't sure.
I think the rest of that, and I think we would have been shooting to and, I believe, we will overcome that merit
increase with some other savings. The other thing we're working on, we announced that we did the $1.2 million of
contributions. We are working on ways, for example, maybe cutting back on some traditional marketing spend
that maybe we can do differently and some travel and related, it's going to be lower just because people aren't.
So there's lots of ins and outs that are moving.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Andrew, what I might say is that we would have – without COVID, we would have continued on a
downward trajectory as we continue to look at leveraging the business, so through AIM, we would have got
additional leverage there. But we are now going to have some COVID-related expenses and as the credit
environment worsens, we think that we'll have our collection expense could possibly go up. So little early for us to
kind of give any guidance around COVID or collection expenses, but I think, in general, you can expect to see sort
of flat to downward trends pre that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
That's helpful. And then related to the PPP funds and what's going to creep through the margin, do you guys have
an estimate of what the fees are going to increase like that? I guess, the first slug and I can extrapolate the
second [indiscernible] (39:21)?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So we did about $1 billion of funded loans and I think – we think that the number is going to be about 2.8%
of those, maybe 2.9%. So it's, I think, $29-ish million. If I actually started to get just a little bit of that cash in, how
it's going to hit the P&L, Andrew, I haven't got all figured out, I think even the accounting profession is working on
that because these will, in theory, come in and be forgiven and should go away in a relatively short period of time.
So how we bring that into income, I think, we're working on but I think the numbers first wave just around $29-ish
million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Andrew. I might just mention how today went after the SBA opened up PPP and clearly, I have been
working with our small business customers to get them ready to enter into the portal and we had about a
thousand people queued up. And we actually entered less than 30 because the portal was down, it was really a
disastrous reopening today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Got you. That's helpful. But kind of concerning for the government. So, I guess, excluding how this might flow
through the margin then, the margin trend still just downward. I know there's room on the funding side to cut and
[ph] build this (40:52) rates and I know the floor is there but is that the trend still so negative?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think you're going to see that core trend grind down as we kind of work through in this lower interest rate
environment. I don't think it's going to be a fast grind down things to be slow. You might see even see us be flat to
just down a little bit next quarter. I think we've got a couple of things that we can pull but not much in the deposit
side. We're working on the very last pieces of that right now. And then there will be a slow grind of probably, if
we're at [ph] 3.75 basis points (41:27) now, we might exit the year at, down maybe 8 basis points to 10 basis
points from there if things just grind down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. That's really helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I will just add purchase accounting is going to be really hard to predict because some of the modifications and
other things are affecting the timing we might roll over loans, how quickly those are going to come and pay down.
So I think that's going to be another interesting trend to keep an eye on that. I'm not sure exactly how that will go
but even probably more unpredictable than it normally is.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. You may proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. I hope, Bryan didn't fall off his chair when he saw the first quarter loan loss provision at $21.5 million. I guess,
my question is, I mean, the economy has unfortunately deteriorated since the end of March. If things remain
unchanged does it sound like Bryan that ACL to total loan ratio would continue to move higher under that
scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say it will, I just don't know how much. You know a lot of things will change. We focused on getting
where we needed to be at the end of the quarter. But as I see it, it looks like I'm guessing that the Moody's
forecast will deteriorate a little bit. Now, we still have another 60 some days yet before the end of the quarter, so
we'll see how return to work and some other things affect the economy. But I think all things being equal what I
know today it's likely that that number will creep up. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then – and thanks for the loan exposure in modification data. I guess, when you look at the
industries at risk, what specific industries would your highlight? Are you experiencing the highest amount of
modification request and could you maybe share some modification data within those industries?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Terry, actually if you look at some of those detailed pages for example, you look at lodging. The last bullet
point on the far right does reference our loan modifications. And I'm sure you probably didn't have time to look at

the slides in detail. But for example that the lodging portfolio has had $60.4 million of loan modifications through
April 23.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And Terry, on a relative basis, it's page 3 of the document, there's a second section. The restaurants and bars
even though it's about the same dollar amount, it's a higher percentage of that segment. So we've laid out the
percentages of the segments there. It's 26% of outstanding balances at the end of March. Lodging and retail real
estate are in the teens percentage. So hope that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. My tiny screen did not go all the way to the right. So thanks for pointing that out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then I guess just the – maybe last question. It really sounds like the Operation Customer Compass really paid
off over the last 45 days. Last year you were targeting, was it $10 million of benefits this year and then another $5
million next year and part of that was on the revenue side. Are you still comfortable with those types of numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would say that that we absolutely are, we actually overachieved from what we anticipated last year. And the
other thing I would say is based upon the last 45 days, we kind of were internally calling it Customer Compass
2.0, we think there is a whole another opportunity for us to make improvements on because of what we've seen
over the last 45 days and our ability to reallocate our people, change our processes and deploy new technology
that enable us to respond the way we have in the last 45 days. So I think I don't think we're quite prepared to give
additional guidance, but I think at the end of the second quarter, we should be able to give more guidance on
what can be expected out of that process through the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And as you can expect, the revenue lift is hard to find in amongst everything else what's going on, but I would say
if you look at our FTEs, those have dropped another 80 – almost 90 I guess people this quarter, a lot of that is
related to and a lot of the prior quarter's drop was also related to customer comps initiative. So as we found
efficiencies and we haven't replaced turnover and various other things and have utilized the capacity as we
brought in, thanks Blue Valley and Rockford Bank & Trust over the last half of the year, so it really feels like we're
getting good traction on the efficiency side. And I think we're in better position with the tools we put in on the
revenue side as well.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Yeah. On revenue side, you've seen our commercial loan growth, which we're pleased that that has really turned
around the last several quarters. I think that because of the customer modification – well not modifications, but
what we've done on waiving fees on the consumer side and small business side, we're giving back some of what
we would have for fee revenue, but we're pleased with what that core is before the waiving of those fees because
of COVID-19.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW. You
may proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hope everybody's doing well during these challenging times. Mostly my questions
have been asked and answered, and thanks for the great detail in the slide presentation. But I'm just wondering,
are there any concerns with the pending deal with AIM and that it could not close, are there any types of triggers
in the merger agreement that that could result in the deal not happening?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Damon, we have a double trigger. We busted through the first trigger, which is if we're down 15% from the
original price, meaning our stock prices down 15% or more that's the first trigger. So we busted through that
obviously if you look at where we got the deal and where the stock prices at $30 or $31 now. But the second
trigger is that we would have to be down 15% more [ph] in the KRX (00:48:41) and certainly we haven't busted
that. We've tracked very, very close to the [ph] KRX (00:48:47), so we really don't anticipate that being a problem.
The management team is still very positive at AIM looking forward to being part of Heartland, so I really don't see
any issues that could kill that deal. And it's interesting because Lubbock has really done and continues to do quite
well. The locations, however, down in – as Bruce said down in Odessa-Midland, those would be more impacted
not because there is direct lending into oil and gas, but is the related support systems, hotels, motels, multi-family,
restaurants, bars so forth and so on that will clearly be impacted with oil slowing down. So I don't see any
problems with it Damon, we should be in good shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then with regards to mortgage banking, a pretty decent quarter, this past quarter. How does the
pipeline look kind of going into here in the second quarter and could we expect at least a similar level if not higher
than what we saw this quarter?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Yeah. I would say the pipeline is going into the quarter, look good and I think refinancing activity and other activity
is good at the moment. In the environment looking much [ph] pass the (00:50:04) next couple months and what's
in the pipeline is not an easy endeavor, so I think next quarter should be as good or better. I think we can do that
and then after that I would be cautious because I really don't know. You've seen some others like JPMorgan and
others who are pulled back from the industry – the industry. We haven't done that, but it does make you wonder
how the mortgage industry will do going forward, and we will be part of that industry, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And Damon as you know most of our mortgage operation today is being originated out of Texas and primarily
Lubbock and [ph] as Bruce (00:50:41) mentioned Lubbock has been very, very strong in the pipeline what we
expect in April and what we expect in May, very strong. But we just don't know beyond the second quarter what
that's going to look like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just lastly Bryan, just to kind of follow-up on your comment about being a challenge to
model out accretively yield going forward just given numerous moving parts. Would you say that this quarter's
$2.75 million or 9 basis point impact, would you say that that was kind of what you were expecting or would you
say that you might see it pick up a little bit higher like it has been in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would say before the pandemic hit, I would say that would have been a little bit lower than we would have
expected. Whether that will continue or not, the pace of refinancing – not refinancing, but getting at deals to re-
underwrite them at their normal time that they renew is what I'm just not sure about with what's the modifications
that we've done. Some of those might get delayed for 60 to 90 days. And so that could just push out when we
bring in the income [ph] book is (00:51:51) what we normally would. But I think it was a little bit lower than we
would have budgeted or thought going into the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, I think when Bryan provided kind of some guidance last quarter we certainly didn't anticipate the Fed action.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
You know the emergency rate cut. So while we anticipated a little better, I think we're actually pretty pleased at
how we were able to respond and we were ready on both the deposit side and our floors kicked in.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2020
Okay. And could you remind us what percentage of your loan portfolio has floors. And can you just confirm that
that's a driving factor and not seeing more erosion on the core margin given the big movement and make by the
Fed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So the way I usually explain this is of our commercial loans about 50% are variable or what I would call
semi-variable. Another almost 55% to 60% have floors or about $2 million round numbers. Of those $2 million,
75%, I'm sorry – billion not million, right
[indiscernible] (00:53:01)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Same thing I was doing Bryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
These are billion. These are billion. So $2 billion have floors, $1.5 billion or 75% are in the money are already at
their floor, so we've dropped lower at the floor. So, we have a few where we put lower floors and just to guard
against, should we ever negotiate with customers to make sure we had at least something that wouldn't go
negative should we ever unfortunately get into a negative rate environment. So we have a few of those, but the
bulk are the floors kicked in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. That's all that I had. Thank you everyone.
