Richard Scott Blackley
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of today's presentation, where you can see Capital
One earned $2.4 billion or $5.06 per diluted common share in the third quarter. Included in EPS for the quarter
were three adjusting items, which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share in the
quarter was $5.05 per share.
In addition to the adjusting items, we had a couple of notable items in the quarter. We recorded a gain of $470
million, or $0.79 per share, related to an equity stake in Snowflake, which recently priced its initial public offering.
We also recorded a $327 million, or $0.54 per share, allowance release associated with moving a partnership
card portfolio to held-for-sale.
Turning to slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. Excluding the held-for-sale transfer,
we released $390 million of allowance for the total company in the third quarter, mostly driven by a smaller
balance sheet. In our allowance, we continue to assume no benefits from further government stimulus beyond
any residual impacts of prior legislation and a correspondingly severe economic outlook, with targeted qualitative
factors for specific areas of uncertainty. We assume we end this year at a 9.7% unemployment rate, improving to
around 8% by the end of 2021.
Turning to slide 5, you can see that allowance coverage levels were essentially flat as allowance releases were
commensurate with contractions in our card and commercial loan portfolios. Our Consumer Banking coverage
ratio declined modestly to 4% from 4.3%, mostly driven by a release in our auto finance allowance, which was
driven by updated auction price assumptions.
Moving to slide 6, I'll discuss our liquidity position. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio
during the third quarter was 147%, up from 146% at the end of the second quarter, and well above the 100%
regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity is
largely flat to last quarter at $148 billion, including about $44 billion in cash, driven by continued inflows of
consumer deposits.
Turning to slide 7, you can see that our net interest margin declined 10 basis point quarter-over-quarter. This
decline was driven by higher average cash in the quarter, the effects of investment securities and lower average
card balances.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
In the quarter, we purchased securities to manage down a portion of our excess cash balance, resulting in a
quarter-over-quarter decline in ending cash of approximately $12 billion. Given the low rate environment, we also
saw our premium amortization expense increase due to increased pre-payments on our mortgage-backed
securities, driving a 5-basis-point net interest margin decline relative to last quarter.
Looking forward, our net interest margin will depend on how the impacts of this downturn in any future stimulus
play out across our balance sheet, including asset mix, deposit balances and pricing and our cash position.
Lastly, turning to slide 8, I will cover our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13% at the
end of the third quarter, up 60 basis points from the second quarter. We expect to maintain our $0.10 dividend for
the quarter. Our decision is mainly driven by the fact that we are in the midst of our CCAR resubmission.
We continue to accrete capital and we expect to reassess our common stock dividend after we receive the Fed's
feedback on our CCAR resubmission. We recognize the capital distribution, both dividends and share
repurchases, is an important component of shareholder return.
Turning to preferred stock issuances in the quarter, we issued a new series of preferred stock as we expect to
redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series F in the fourth quarter. This redemption will result in a one-time
charge that will reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately $17 million in the fourth
quarter of 2020. Following the redemption of Series F, beginning in Q1 of next year, we expect quarterly preferred
dividends to be about $60 million, barring any future issuances or other redemption activity.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide 10, which summarizes results for our Credit Card business. Year-over-year,
Credit Card loan balances, purchase volume and revenue declined in the third quarter, driven by the impacts of
the pandemic. The biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved
significantly compared to both the prior year and linked quarters.
Credit Card segment results are a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11.
Consumer behavior was a key driver of Domestic Card results in the third quarter. In the current environment,
consumers continue to behave cautiously, spending less, saving more and paying down debt. These behaviors
are amplified by the cumulative effects of stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry.
We're seeing the effects of cautious consumer behavior across several key businesses' results, including
pressure on spending and higher payments rates, resulting in declining loan balances. But this cautious behavior
is also a key driver of the most impactful Domestic Card headline in the quarter, strikingly strong credit results.
We posted exceptional credit performance in the third quarter, especially in the context of the pandemic. The
charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.64%, a 48-basis-point improvement year-over-year and an 89-basis-point
improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.21%, 150 basis
points better than the prior year. The linked quarter improvement in the delinquency rate was 53 basis points,
even though the typical seasonal pattern is a 40-basis-point increase.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
In addition to positive impacts from cautious consumers, stimulus and widespread forbearance, our credit
performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began, including our avoidance
of high balance revolvers and caution on credit lines.
Our own Domestic Card forbearance is not a significant driver of credit performance because enrollment is low.
We provided updated information on Domestic Card forbearance on appendix slide 17.
Purchase volume is rebounding from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Third quarter purchase volume
was down just 1% from the prior-year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 15% in the
second quarter and about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic.
By late September and through the first half of October, year-over-year purchase volume growth was modestly
positive. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were
seeing before the pandemic.
In the third quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances shrank by $9.1 billion, or 9%, year-over-year. Average
loans declined 6% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, both ending and average loans were down 4%.
Cautious consumer behavior drove the declines. Our choices to tighten underwriting and pull back on marketing
early in the pandemic were also a factor.
Ending loan balances include the impact of two notable factors. We moved $2.1 billion of partnership loans to
held-for-sale in the quarter, as Scott mentioned, which adds to both year-over-year and linked-quarter declines.
And, of course, we added the Walmart portfolio last year, which offsets the year-over-year decline, but has no
impact on the linked quarter.
Excluding both the move to held-for-sale and the Walmart portfolio acquisition, third quarter ending loans declined
about 13% from the prior year quarter and about 2% from the linked quarter.
Third quarter revenue decreased 6% year-over-year, in line with average loans. The revenue margin was up 7
basis points from the third quarter of 2019 to 16.2%. Non-interest expense was down $274 million, or 13%, from
the third quarter of last year, largely driven by our choice to pull back on marketing when the pandemic hit. While
total company marketing in the third quarter was essentially flat compared to the second quarter, Domestic Card
marketing increased from unusually low levels, with most of the increase weighted toward the end of the quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect a significant sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter,
powered by the normal Q3 to Q4 seasonal ramp plus the full quarter effect of the increases in Domestic Card. As
always, actual marketing in the fourth quarter and longer term will depend on our real-time assessment of
opportunities for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace.
Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $632 million year-over-year, driven by the allowance benefit
of moving the partnership portfolio to held-for-sale and the volume-driven allowance release that Scott discussed.
Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Driven by our auto business,
ending loans increased 11% year-over-year. Average loans also grew 11%. When the COVID downturn began,
we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient assets. We believe several factors are
driving the growth we're seeing even in the context of our tightening.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
The auto market rebound thus far has been stronger for larger franchise dealers, the part of the market where we
are focused. Some of the recent growth is likely driven by pent-up demand from the early days of the shutdown.
And our digital products and services are driving growth in direct-to-consumer originations and growth with
dealers who want to provide a low-touch car buying experience in response to social distancing.
Our dealer relationship strategy and the digital infrastructure and capabilities we built from the bottom-up put us in
a strong position to grow high-quality auto loans even with tighter underwriting.
Third quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $43.3 billion, or 21%, year-over-year, driven by the
stimulus-driven surge in deposits in the second quarter. Average deposit interest rate decreased 65 basis points
as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics over
the course of the second and third quarters.
Consumer Banking revenue increased 9% from the third quarter of last year. Revenue growth from higher auto
loans and retail deposits was partially offset by differences in the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts preceding
our deposit pricing moves. Non-interest expense in Consumer Banking was up 3%.
Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $246 million year-over-year, driven by lower charge-offs and
a modest allowance release in our auto business. Our auto business posted unusually strong credit results in the
third quarter. The charge-off rate improved 137 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter to 0.23%. The
delinquency rate improved 271 basis points year-over-year to 3.76%.
In addition to the same general drivers of Domestic Card credit strength, auto credit benefited from very strong
auction values. And in contrast to Domestic Card, our own COVID auto forbearance is having a significant
positive impact, because we've extended relief to customers in later stages of delinquency and enrollment is
much higher. We provided an updated auto forbearance information chart on appendix slide 18.
Moving to slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 3%
year-over-year, driven by growth in selected C&I and CRE specialties. Average loans were up 5%. Average
deposits increased about 18% from the third quarter of 2019 as middle market customers continued to bolster
their liquidity.
Third quarter revenue was up 7% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue growth from higher loan and deposit
volumes, higher non-interest income and lower deposit rate paid was partially offset by lower loan yields. Non-
interest expense increased by 2%.
Provision for credit losses improved by $167 million compared to the third quarter of 2019, largely driven by the
allowance release that Scott discussed. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the quarter was
0.43%. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked
quarters to 8.7%, driven by downgrades in multi-family CRE. The criticized non-performing loan rate rose
modestly to 1.0%. Our oil and gas exposure declined year-over-year. We've provided a breakout of our oil and
gas portfolio composition and reserves on appendix slide 19.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results in the quarter and our positioning for the future. Capital One
posted strong third quarter results. Year-over-year revenue growth and lower non-interest expenses drove pre-
provision earnings up, and provision for credit losses improved by more than $1 billion as credit results across our
card and auto businesses remained strikingly strong.

Pulling way up, we continue to be well served by the choices we made before the pandemic. Since our founding
days, we've hardwired resilience into the choices we've made on credit, capital and liquidity through good times
and bad.
As a result, we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends, a fortified balance sheet, and deep
experience, and successfully navigating through prior periods of stress, including the Great Recession.
And our investments to transform our technology and how we work, and our efforts to drive the company to digital
are powering our response to the downturn, and positioning us for the acceleration of digital change, and adoption
driven by the pandemic.
As we continue to lean into resilience to manage through the near-term challenges, we also continue to focus on
the things that create long-term value, when delivered and sustained over time, profitable resilient growth,
effective investments to transform technology, positive operating leverage and capital distribution.
And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. I guess I have a question on the net interest margin trajectory going forward, Scott. I know you talked
about some contributors that caused the sequential degradation and the dependency for some items in the future.
But looking ahead, if we assume a stable macro, could you maybe just dimensionalize some of the upside levers
you have? I know there's a step-up in the Walmart share, you have the funding costs coming through, the lower
funding costs and then lower liquidity potentially. Could you just talk about those, Scott?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Sure. Hi, good afternoon, Sanjay. So, look, with respect to NIM, I think that the current margin is towards the low
end of where I would expect to see NIM, given our balance sheet mix. And if I just look at kind of the factors right
now, cash is elevated, but deposit growth has slowed in Q3.
In Q4, we're going to get the full quarter benefit of the deposit pricing actions that we took in Q3. And then, auto
growth is positive to NIM. So, I look at just those factors. And those are all positives.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
When you talk about longer term, more stimulus, is, the potential there is that that might drive more savings,
which would be a headwind to NIM if we received more cash, in the form of deposits. But on the other hand, that's
going to be a positive to our credit performance, and that seems like a good trade to make.
So, overall, at this point, feeling like we're towards the lows on NIM. And there are a number of factors that would
go in a positive direction, if everything and the economy kind of went – would stable from here forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And I guess talking about the economy, your reserve rates were stable, if not, sort of declined a tad.
Could you just talk about how you see that unfolding, assuming things don't change materially in the macro
situation? And maybe, Rich, you could chime in on some of the things that you're worried about or not on the
macro side because you mentioned credit quality looks strikingly strong. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Why don't I start on the allowance and then, Rich, you can jump on the back end of that question. So, when I look
at the allowance, there's a couple important considerations. One is that we build our allowance to exclude the
potentially positive effects of stimulus beyond what's already in place, and we've assumed some further
worsening in the economy.
Second, our delinquency inventories are at really, really low level. So, we're starting at a place where it's going to
take a while for losses to actually manifest. So, I feel really comfortable with our coverage levels where they are
today. And if we just look at going forward, more stimulus could be a significant positive factor to allowance and
the economy is another wild card, if it worsens beyond our current assumptions, and we didn't get stimulus in that
case. In that case, we might be looking at the potential for reserve additions. But in an economy, that goes kind of
sideways or doesn't worsen much or if we get stimulus, I think there's some upside in the allowance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Sanjay, just a comment about the consumer. It's – this is the biggest disconnect that I certainly have experienced
in my three decades of building Capital One between what we see in the economy itself and the actual
performance of the consumer, especially from a credit point of view. Now some things, I think, always happen in a
downturn and that is consumers tend to get more conservative. So, they tend to pull back, spend less, save more.
So, in some ways, why would what we see here be any different from the past? And look, I still put a high degree
of uncertainty around things. So, I'm going to give you some views, but don't use this as like a prediction of what
the consumer is going to do in the rest of this downturn. But I do think the consumer being in better shape going
into this crisis starts kind of on the plus ledger for the consumer.
Debt levels were lower, payment obligations, lower still, supported by the low interest rates. The savings rate over
the past few years was, I think, around double what it was before the Great Recession. And so, the consumer
entered in a stronger situation. Then what happened is, unlike most other downturns and certainly, unlike the
Great Recession, which took a lot of months to sort of build its momentum, this thing kind of came all of a sudden.
And the world went into a free fall sort of as I often say, we all went down the elevator together at the same time.
Consumers did, companies did and the government did.

Capital One Financial Corp.
(COF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
And so, that I think the reaction by the consumers was more striking and more conservative than has happened in
the past. So, they're spending less, saving more, paying down debt. And I think it's amplified relative to the past.
Then overlay on top of this, of course, that the swift and unprecedented government stimulus and the widespread
forbearance programs across the banking industry were both much greater and much swifter than occurred in the
past.
And so, the cumulative impact to consumer balance sheets of lower wages offsetting government support and
lower spending is the – some of these effects by their conservatism and some of the benefits that they were
granted by external parties has added up to a positive net consumer sort of savings effect of over $1 trillion or
about $10,000 per household.
And obviously, the impact across individual consumers and households is highly variable. But we now have the
expiration of the expanded unemployment benefit. That's a blow to many millions of employed – of unemployed
Americans. I think what we're dealing with is a cumulation of benefits that the consumer has had during this
downturn, such that when suddenly the stimulus was kind of shut off, we didn't see our credit metrics suddenly
skyrocket to worse places. I think the consumer is working through some of that cumulative that has built up.
But I think that we still have to look at – we're talking about electrifying economic numbers, awful lot of job losses,
now a lot more of them being more permanent and the government stimulus at this point not having been
renewed. So, I think it's just a matter of time before this thing could reverse itself in a significant way.
And you see everything I say, I just want to say relative to a metaphor I've been using when I talk to investors is,
every month that there are favorable credit trends, we're sort of burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the huge
economic worsening mountain, such that even as potentially things revert to significantly worse place for the
consumer, I think we've reduced the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact.
So, those are some thoughts, Sanjay, on what we're seeing. It's certainly not something collectively that I've
observed before. But – and no one should look at this and feel – I'll speak for myself. We certainly – we feel really
good about the performance we're seeing, but we feel quite cautious about what could happen.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the auto results. I know that you mentioned you have very strong auto results,
both on the loan side as well as on the credit side. First question here is just around the used car prices. They're
clearly up a lot, at about 15% year-on-year. And I guess, just wanted to understand how much that piece of the
equation impacted your net charge-offs and your NIM around auto? And what you're assuming for used car prices
going forward from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay, Betsy. There's been unprecedented volatility in auction prices since the start of the pandemic. At the start
of the pandemic, we saw a sudden collapse in auction prices, as stay-at-home orders basically froze markets and
auction houses rushed to move online.
By the end of the second quarter, we saw auction prices rebound to pre-COVID levels. And as the stay-at-home
orders were lifted, consumer demand experienced sort of a V-shaped recovery in the auto space and supply
remained constrained by lease delays and the decision of most lenders to suspend repossession.
At the start of the third quarter, there was a massive amount of uncertainty around the stability of these trends,
particularly whether consumer demand would remain strong with the expiration of stimulus and whether it would
be enough to offset projected increases in supply.
As it's turned out, through the third quarter, consumer demand remained incredibly strong, resulting in supply
constraints that drove up auction prices, as dealers struggled to maintain inventory levels. Over the last couple of
weeks, we've seen the industry start to work through these supply constraints with auction prices declining slightly
and dealer inventory starting to recover towards the pre-COVID levels.
So, going forward, we would expect auction prices to normalize over the next several months, as the industry fully
works through these supply issues. We're underwriting to an assumption that they're going to be significantly
adverse from there just because of the – just to be cautious and because of the extreme volatility.
To your question about how important was this in the results, it was one of the factors. So, for example, in the
credit results, there really were three auto – so, why was auto credit so good beyond what we're seeing in card
that we've talked about? There are three auto-specific effects.
One is, our COVID loan extension programs having a more meaningful impact on our credit metrics than it is in
card, because the program's got more – a bigger proportion of customers in it and because we extended relief to
the impacted customers in later stage of delinquency.
And then we've got the used car auction prices, which basically reached all-time highs in Q3. And we've also seen
somewhat higher auto recoveries from the catch-up from our temporary suspension of repossessions earlier in
the downturn. So, it's definitely sort of a bunch of planets aligning in the auto space driving performance that is
extraordinary and in some sense, certainly on the credit side, much of the things I talked about are more
temporary in nature.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Got it. Okay. No, that's super helpful. Thanks for all that color, Rich. The follow-up question I have just has to do
with what you're seeing with regard to the accounts that are exiting forbearance in the various product sets that
you have. Some other folks this earnings cycle have been suggesting that accounts exiting forbearance are
exiting with a higher rate of delinquencies. I'm wondering if you are seeing the same thing and if you could put a
number on what that difference is between accounts that were in forbearance and aren't. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, by the way, I would put a – let's say, you told me a downturn of any kind was coming and we installed
the forbearance program, I would, with 100% confidence, say, customers who enter a forbearance program and
exited will have higher delinquencies than those who never did only because you take a population and you now
create a filter, and this is an important filter, did you raise your hand and say, I'd like some of that forbearance?
It's versus one minus that group, it would be extremely rare for that group not to have higher delinquencies.
Interestingly, probably the biggest driver of the delinquency number is – it's like what – or what percentage of
them are when they leave and they stay current. But probably the biggest driver of that is how wide the funnel
was in the first place by which the company was inviting customers to come in and take the forbearance. The
wider the funnel, the more likely regular, very low-risk customers sort of took advantage of the program.
So in our business, let me just look this up here. If we look at the customers in our card business, we look at the
customers who no longer enroll – who are no longer enrolled but were previously, 88% of them are current. In
auto, it is 86%.
And the other thing, again, I just want to say I'm not sure how much information content there is in that, only
because one has filtered a population. The most telling thing would be the overall delinquencies that you see on
our portfolio because all these customers who have entered forbearance are basically part of the delinquency
metrics that you observed.

Rich, you noted that we could see a significant ramp in marketing in 4Q. Can you maybe just clarify what the
expectations are in terms of the quarter-over-quarter increase?
And second, just more broadly speaking, when competition has historically pulled back, you've used it as an
opportunity when you've seen a window to accelerate growth. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about
your approach to increasing marketing spend at this point. And are things still too uncertain for you to do that? Do
you have any sort of visibility at this point? Or is it more just seasonal in nature and we should expect it to remain
low as another issuer talked about this morning? Thanks.

Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, look, this – our saying that marketing could be higher in the fourth quarter than the third is not a
declaration that we see all the light at the end of the tunnel we're all in. You're right, at Capital One, we sometimes
zig while others zag. We also sometimes zig while others zig. And it's all a situational kind of thing.
The primary – the reason that we're kind of leaning into this marketing guidance relative to the next quarter is
more just how low it is now, not to look at that and say that at that low level, it's going to sustain itself.
So, let me just give you a little more context here. We pulled back in certain channels early in the crisis in
response to the decreased opportunity for quality growth, and just given the unprecedented uncertainty early on.
We've since reentered most channels. And it's interesting, while marketing was flat overall in the company, within
card, marketing increased through the quarter. Again, it was mostly just coming off such a very low level.
And so, what we are saying is, you have the seasonal ramp that always happens in the fourth quarter at Capital
One. And then on top of that, because even though our marketing was flat within the quarter, company-wide,
within card, it was quite low. And so, we're really saying just the full seasonal – the full quarter effect of that will
also pull the numbers a fair amount higher. So, it's really more a pulling up from being so low as opposed to a
statement of a big transformation and how much marketing and growth we're going after here.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. In your prepared remarks, you talked about capital return being an important part of the picture for
shareholders. If we look, the capital ratios are at 13% and once we get through the next few quarters, it should be
at at least 13.5% or over 20% of your market cap in excess.
Now, I know we saw a handful of things that we need to get through, the Fed stress test. But it seems like if we
have the minimum from the SCB of 10.1% and your internal target of 11%, it seems like you have the potential to
get pretty aggressive on returning capital. So, if you maybe just talk about the capital priorities and how quickly do
you think you can manage the capital down once we have clarity on where the economy is headed? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. Well, as you know, all the large banks are going through CCAR 2.0 right now. And as I
mentioned, we're going to get through that process and get our feedback before we make any adjustments to our
capital situation.

I think that as you talked about with the stress capital buffer, the buffer for us under that framework or the total
capital required under that framework is 10.1%, we want to operate in most environments with a buffer above
that, so probably over 11%.
I think that – what I'm hoping is that we'll start to see the Fed move away from the current level of restrictions in
that in the first quarter, they will migrate to the stress capital buffer framework, which should allow us to manage
our capital distributions, both dividends and share repurchases on a much more dynamic basis.
And as we talked about and you mentioned in our – the comments, we do appreciate that this is an important
component of shareholder return. And so, we're looking to get back into the business of having an appropriate
amount of capital and making sure the shareholders are receiving distributions.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Rich, you, in response to Sanjay's question, touched on
something that I think is really interesting. You mentioned divergence between labor markets and credit markets
and credit performance. And you hypothesized whether or not what we've seen is a delay in credit events or we're
actually going to see moderation from all of the policy initiatives. So, you alluded to the fact that you think it's the
latter. I want to make sure – I want to understand, in part what drives that view? And then I want to turn the
question to Scott and ask where is the reserve or the allowance in that context? Are you still more reserved in the
delay scenario at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah, Rick, I want to make sure that I articulate for a second your two – just articulate for a second, your two
scenarios, the delay scenario described what you're saying that is, that would be it's going to get as bad as ever.
It's just delayed in getting there, and the moderation [indiscernible] (00:45:30)...

...moderated. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll let Scott talk about the allowance. Just sort of – it's – there have been – well,
certainly, right now, there is – the divergence between the two is extraordinary. I do think that – and then the most
common thing everybody is talking about is government stimulus. And I believe that is an important effect.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
I wouldn't underestimate the collective impact of forbearance across the banking industry as well and to some
extent in rents and other things. But between the strength of the consumer entered the downturn and the various
things that are providing some relief, it is clearly disconnecting the relationship that we would otherwise see
between unemployment and the consumers' financial health and credit performance.
So, the – I think it is very plausible that this sort of bank account, if you will, of cumulatively some good things that
the consumer has had available is something that is finite and very plausibly can't last for an extended period of
time. I think it still buffers for a short period of time. But if we don't see stimulus, and if the economy continues to
really be hurting, I have trouble envisioning how the consumer doesn't end up getting in a worse place from here.
But my points are I think that timing of that can still be buffered by the accumulated benefits. And then, my other
point is that I think burrowing through the tunnel, I picture a big mountain, which is the bad economy going up and
then going down on the other side, burrowing through the tunnel, and even then if the consumer has to rejoin that
bad mountain, if you will, a strain metaphor, I think that some of the worst aspects of that downturn will have been
averted by virtue of every month that passes.
What I want to do is pivot to Scott to comment on how we've handled the allowance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Rich. Rick, so, if you think about what we have to do in the allowance, we're starting with
delinquency levels that are not connected to the level of unemployment that we're seeing. And so, one of the
things that we have to do in the allowance is to take those delinquency levels and over time, kind of get them to
link up with unemployment levels.
One of the reasons that we are thinking that's happening is that some of the stimulus actually comes in, in a form
where it's replacing income. And so, even though you've got elevated level of unemployment, you basically are –
you have a consumer who may be unemployed, counting in the unemployed calculations, but is receiving benefits
that are allowing them to stay current as if they were fully employed.
So, as we start to see stimulus unfold here, the real question that we face in the allowance is just how long is that
income replacement going to continue and what does that mean to the total loss content. So, those are the kinds
of issues that we would face with the allowance.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research
Thanks. Good evening. Rich, can you discuss the competitive landscape as you think about the potential threats
on one hand from the neobank sort of the Chimes of the world that operate exclusively online without traditional
branch networks in this sort of post-COVID environment?
And on the other hand, the buy now pay later like the Klarnas and Afterpays, how do you see their presence
impacting the competitive environment in the card business, say, over the next three to five years? I mean is there
any potential benefit to deploying some of your excess capital into M&A and what are those areas? Or are those
sort of capabilities, things that you think you can build on your own?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, well, Bill, it's certainly quite fascinating and striking to see what's happening on both the banking side and the
lending side with respect to these new competitors. Let me talk about the buy now pay later phenomenon. There
has been point of sale lending for forever basically. And it's always been there as another form of financing. And
it's interesting, in many ways, the credit card became the disruptor in point-of-sale lending. I never forget when
early on in the Capital One journey, I ran into this guy who said, hey, you ruined my business. And I said, I'm so
sorry, how did we ruin your business? And he said, I ran a furniture store. I made my money on financing, and the
credit card has kind of put me out of business. And so, the credit card has been an incredibly efficient tool in a
world where point-of-sale financing has continued, and there's logical reasons they both would coexist.
I think it's really striking what has happened recently with respect to the buy now pay later, which there's a couple
of striking things going on that are not – haven't been part of the historical context. One is the – just the
technology, the ease of the whole thing. And with a single click, you can kind of buy now pay later, that has been
one aspect of this. And the other is the – that merchants are paying the lenders at this point, the way the
marketplace works, merchants paying the lenders, which has allowed us to be a pretty financially attractive
business for some of these neo players and has helped keep that industry unassailable.
A lot of times, you have a race to the bottom in terms of how high the short-term pricing gets, et cetera. So, this is
something that's growing rapidly, and I think that it's something that we are looking carefully at and watching and
trying to assess where that market is going.
We wonder how sustainable the revenue model of that is with respect to the merchant subsidies in a more
competitive marketplace, so we'll have to keep an eye on that. But I think the – this is another example of how
digital technology and the real-time instant solutions is where the entire world is going.
The history of banking is to deliver solutions on a batch basis to consumers. And I think this is another example of
how real-time solutions are here and all banks, if they don't increasingly figure out how to leverage data in real-
time and bring instant customized solutions to consumers, may find themselves in a bad place.
Then you got the whole banking side of the marketplace, the Chimes and some of the other players that I think
also have created a disruptive model. We tend to root for their success because we are also a disruptor in this
marketplace. And the more collectively all of us can get at the – make progress against the highly inertial
entrenched behavior of Americans to always bank with their branch bank. The more we can chip away collectively
with that, I think the more opportunity there is for all of us, digital players, Capital One included, but we're certainly
inspired by some of the things that we see by some of the neobanks.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research
That's super helpful, Rich. Thank you. If I can squeeze in another quick one on auto, can you discuss how your
mix of new versus used originations has evolved? And whether there's any particular area that you've been
leaning into more heavily?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
There's not – well, there's been a lot of used, of course, just some of the market conditions that have led to the –
a lot of used car buying. So, I don't have in front of me data with respect to that. So, the used car opportunity is a
sweet spot for most banks because the captive lenders tend to subsidize their new car purchases. So, the
majority of our entire business is used. And the more the used car market thrives, the better it is for Capital One.
I think the bigger effect that's going on that we're struck by in addition to just how all the sort of the tide of auto
has risen all the boats for all the players, and it's just kind of a strikingly sort of good time in the industry,
parenthetically, we should all know in the middle of the massive pandemic, so we got to be very careful here. But
kind of on little cat feet, the traction that we're seeing with our digital strategy is particularly we're seeing in auto,
because of the very physical nature of how the product is bought.
And this is an example of where the pandemic is accelerating things that would happen anyway. But in the auto
space, the more they accelerate the sort of direct side, not necessarily the pure direct, where no one ever goes to
a dealership, but the semi direct or the hybrid direct, the thing that just involves faster, more digital solutions. That
plays into the hand of Capital One because we've invested for years in real-time automated solutions and being
able to underwrite any car in America on any lot in less than a second, and to be able to provide that information
to consumers before they go into a dealership and to also lessen the amount of hard work and waiting once you
get in.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Rich, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio.
And also, given the stress, are there any opportunistic opportunities that you see coming to market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, our commercial real estate is $30 billion across a range of property types. Relative to most banks, overall, our
portfolio is more concentrated in multi-family, which we view as more resilient, while it's under-weight in more
volatile sectors like hotel, retail, office and construction. So, in the multi-family space, we have $18 billion in
exposure to multi-family, about $13 billion is on balance sheet and about $5 billion in agency loss share.
16


Capital One Financial Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
And of that, of the $13 billion we have on balance sheet, about half of our exposure is in the New York
metropolitan area. And as you know, Don, there are real borrower challenges in the market with low rent
collections and eviction moratoriums.
So, our focus and the significant majority of our portfolio is in rent-regulated and Class B properties, which have
been historically more resilient in recessions. So, the big increase in criticized performing loans was in the multi-
family portfolio. We feel really good about the LTV, the low LTVs that we have backing this book.
But it certainly has our attention that New York's got a number of challenges on the real estate side. And so, we'll
very carefully monitor how this plays out. But we feel collectively very good about our overall real estate portfolio.
And the choices that drove us to where we are.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Rich, at the front end of the questions, you talked a little bit about some of the differences between
this and the Great Recession. I guess another one would be the banks and card issuers themselves are actually
in a better position than they were at that point. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about
how you think that impacts the competitive opportunity and what you're willing to talk about what Capital One's
plans are with respect to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a really insightful comment that you make, Moshe, because, one of the things that we know that
happened in the Great Recession is the consumer was more levered up. But you also had the banking industry,
both banks and non-banks were providing products that were not nearly as well underwritten, that often had
complicated features with them. And there was just a lot of disequilibrium to sort out.
And that really compounded the consumer's journey through the downturn, that their own condition and also
working through some of the things – the most extreme, of course, Moshe, was the mortgage products, and all
the issues there. So, the – and what happened is a lot of the bad lending practices, I'd say bad from a credit risk
point of view, and also certain consumer practices got driven out in the Great Recession.
And on the other side of it was a very rational, high-performing credit card marketplace. And I've said for years on
the other side of the Great Recession, I think this is a strikingly rational marketplace. I find it more rational than
the other lending marketplaces in which we compete. And each of the players there sort of has carved out a
particular niche and they're doing well.
17


Capital One Financial Corp.
(COF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
So, I see Moshe, very rational behavior even right now in the pandemic, virtually, everybody pulled back. First of
all, you start with card players have something happening to them that basically is pretty unique across lending
products. And that is, that our portfolios are shrinking pretty dramatically.
Here, in commercial in general, people drawing down online increase the volumes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, I think that we card players are struck by, oh, my goodness, just with the less spending and all this
conservative behavior by consumers, we've been going backwards pretty rapidly, pretty much all of us have. And
– but I think that that is the flip side of what comes from the strikingly sound and conservative behavior of our
consumers.
So, where does the industry go from here? I think the industry has pulled back, and I think all of us in our own
way, are trying to figure out no one's going to fully step on the bad gas. No one is all the way pulled back.
And I think for everyone, it's how to find the selective opportunities, where you can continue to lean into this thing
and book business that's going to be resilient, even if things get a whole lot worse. And some of the tried and true
strategies, Moshe, we've had for many years, are conservatism on credit lines, the avoidance of high balance
revolvers and so on.
Our strategy has been so resilience-focused. I think that for us, the opportunity to continue to book accounts, be
very conservative on credit lines, build up the potential energies, but continue to be – but being careful on credit
lines, book the – grow the potential energy and delay the release to some extent into kinetic energy through a lot
of line growth until we see more clarity on where this economy is going. So, that's how we're continuing to lean in
even in the context of this pretty electrifying economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks, Rich. And maybe a follow-up question there for Scott. I noticed that revenue suppression had improved
fairly significantly. I guess that works relative to actual delinquencies? And maybe you could just talk a little bit
about how that's going to look going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. You're right. The suppression is a shorter coverage period than allowance. It really only goes through the
point of charge-off. And when you've got low delinquencies, that's improved. So, as long as we see stability in our
delinquency levels that would stay at about the levels where it is now. We started to see them, delinquencies
worsen, that would increase the amount of suppression.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Oh, hi. Pretty much everything has been asked. I guess, just on marketing, I guess the normal seasonal increase
would be maybe $100 million, $150 million, maybe $150 million, $175 million, actually, a normal level would be
maybe more like $500 million or $600 million. So, are there any – I know you're not going to give a point estimate,
but are there any guardrails you should – you could give maybe are we thinking more like a normal seasonal
increase to the low $400 million? Or are we thinking more like a normal seasonal level to the mid-$500 million in
terms of something to pencil in on marketing for the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Brian, we're probably going to leave our guidance where it is. But the main thing we wanted people to just know
that it's been unusually low at this point and don't get too used to the unusually low level and that – so that's why
it's the double effect. We're calling for the double effect of the normal significant seasonal increase that we have
in the fourth quarter, around things like our sponsorships and a lot of things that happen late in the year, as well
as the continuation of what happened late in the quarter against our marketing levels in cards, a phenomenon that
was not visible in the aggregated credit numbers because it just turned out by coincidence, some of the marketing
elsewhere in the company around retail, which had really been sort of higher right out of the gate with all the
deposit inflows that we've had. We pulled back somewhat on retail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Fair enough. I think there was once a quarter in 2009 when you did $90 million in marketing, and I built that into a
