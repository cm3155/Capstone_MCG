M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us. To get started here, I think third quarter was an outstanding
quarter for us, with key success measures like asset quality, core deposit growth, fee growth, pre-provision net
revenue growth, intangible book value accretion were all very strong during the quarter.
We begin every quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our GAAP measures, but honestly, there's so many
adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that we're truly managing to here at Pinnacle that I will
move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted non-GAAP measures.
As you can see here, total revenues, fully delivered EPS and adjusted PPNR are all up meaningfully on a linked-
quarter basis. Revenues are up roughly 7% year-over-year. At a time when many of them predicting banks cannot
earn in 2021 what they earned in 2019, we're proud that fully diluted EPS is already back to the 2019 level for the
third quarter of 2020.
And most importantly, since PPNR has become our primary focus during this pandemic and for the remainder of
2020, adjusted PPNR is up nearly 7.5% over the same quarter last year and roughly 23% on a linked-quarter
annualized basis.
Loan growth of 16.2% year-over-year, for the third quarter, they were flattish. Average loans were up a
[indiscernible] (00:03:49) on a linked-quarter basis. Harold will review that in greater detail shortly and talk about
our expectations going forward, but generally, we continue to believe we'll produce loan growth primarily based on
our ability to take market share. Due to our prolific hiring, we have 73 relationship managers with tenures less
than two years. That's 22% of our RMs and that represents enormous market share movement potential.
Core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace here in the quarter. Of course, year-over-year growth of
$3.4 billion includes roughly $1.5 billion from our PPP borrowers. But the majority of that growth is not that PPP
and more likely is a function of the increased liquidity among our business clients and the low-cost deposit
initiatives that we have put in place this year.
What I think's been a really challenging year here, we continue to have a track record for consistently growing
tangible book value of nearly 13% year-over-year, 14.5% on a linked-quarter annualized basis. Across the bottom
row, you can see that asset quality held up really well in the third quarter with NPAs at just 40 basis points,
classified assets actually down this quarter to the lowest level in the last five years and annualized net charge-offs
just 23 basis points in the quarter.
I'm going to turn it over to Harold and Tim to review the results in much greater detail. As we go through the
details, I find that there is a lot to be encouraged about regarding our net interest margin fundamentals,
particularly the trajectory of our cost of deposits. Fee income was at an all-time high this quarter. We've talked for
some time about [indiscernible] (00:05:44) differentiated model and it has in fact proven to be extraordinarily

resilient, producing record loan originations at an average interest rate to the borrower of 14.4%, record loan
sales to correspondent banks with a record low in the cycle of 4.9% average interest rate, which makes
[indiscernible] (00:06:08) as the 9.5% spread demonstrates, both the value that borrowers place on the
convenience BHG offers and the demand BHG correspondent bank network has for that paper. They also had a
highly rated securitization of their loans during the quarter, further validating the quality of the product that they're
originating.
And as of October 16, just three loans are on a deferral. So, asset quality is holding up very well. We've said for
some time that our expectation was that BHG would prove out the differentiated nature of their model during this
cycle. It seems to me that they're doing that in spades. So Harold will review that in some detail. And as you
know, we've talked about our transition to defense earlier this year, allocating a meaningful part of our
[indiscernible] (00:07:02) capital to reviewing our loans book borrower by borrower. That work was completed in
the third quarter.
And so Tim's going to update you on that work and give you insight on what we're seeing and learning. But my
expectation is it is likely to create optimism despite the fact that there are still unknowns relative to the timing of
the vaccine, desired nature of the stimulus package and the full reopening of economy.
So, Harold, let me turn it over to you.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to get through these next few slides quickly. Many of them
we've shown for quite some time that third quarter results are basically consistent with what we anticipated from
last time. So, I don't believe there are any shocking revelations. As anticipated, loan growth for the third quarter
was essentially flat. [indiscernible] (00:07:58) dropped again to 49% at quarter end, which is the lowest that I can
ever remember. One positive note was that during the quarter, new loan bookings increased consistently each
month after bottoming in July. We're not going to declare that a trend just yet, but it is a positive signal. Our
annual loan book forecast, excluding PPP, remains in the low- to mid-single digits. And I'll cover both loan yields
and PPP in just a second.
Now, in deposits, we had another big deposit quarter. With lower rates, we get more deposits. We had
experienced significant growth in noninterest-bearing deposits ending at $7.1 billion at quarter end, up 47% since
year end.
The number of checking accounts is up almost 9% since year end. So, if I could do a cartwheel, I'd be doing one
right now. We're estimating that the PPP program provided about $1.5 billion of our deposit growth year-to-date.
That's a rough estimate because it's basically impossible to determine a precise number. That number is simply
the net growth in PPP borrowers' deposits between March 31 and September 30.
Last quarter, we mentioned that we expected those funds to evaporate over the next few quarters. My thought
now is that we could be holding on to that money for an extended period of time. More on deposit rates in just a
second.
Next is our usual update around loan pricing. Given the circumstances, this is absolutely great news. Obviously,
year-over-year loan yields are significantly impacted by yield curve adjustments, particularly LIBOR. But as the
tables at the bottom of the slides show, our relationship managers pay a loan pricing in the third quarter. We don't

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
talk about prime based credit much, but weighted average loan rates have not changed a basis point in six
months.
Keep in mind the chart excludes PPP money, so this is blocking and tackling kind of transactions with our client.
Loan pools absolutely are helping. If we can keep this going, our ramp game plan for 2021 will get a shot in the
arm.
I'm not going to spend a great deal of time discussing deposit pricing. This is obviously not a new chart. Nobody's
asking about deposit base anymore because we're so close to the bottom and there's only so much more deposit
money you can get. We continue to target a range of less than 25 basis points to 30 basis points for our deposit
costs by year-end. Our relationship managers have their client list and are working with them aimed at depositors
who have outsized deposit pricing. We have approximately $1.65 billion in wholesale funding maturities over the
next two quarters that we will likely allow to roll off without renewing, thus alleviating some of the liquidity build
and some of the pressure on our net interest margin.
Bringing this information forward from last quarter, the top left chart on investment securities is new. We've been
at an absolute level of invested securities with 13% to 14% of assets for a while. Not looking to change there.
We're starting to get a few questions about deploying excess liquidity into bonds. It's really hard to get excited
about any incremental leverage strategy at this point. There's just a ton of uncertainty right now and [indiscernible]
(00:11:02) the long end of the curve will probably stay where it is for the next several years, we believe carries too
much interest rate risk right now.
There are obviously products out there that we can – where we can get a few basis points for the next year or so,
but credit risk begins to enter the conversation. We've always taken the position that credit risk is reserved for the
loan portfolio. So we need to reduce our wholesale funding book over the next several quarters because – and
this is not rocket science. Eventually and hopefully, the PPP money is going to turn into cash. So this liquidity
issue is not a two- to three-quarter issue, it's likely to be a one- to two-year issue.
Along those lines, we're showing that we're a $34 billion bank at September 30. I've seen, I believe, we are more
like about a $29 billion to $30 billion bank as we've got about $2.5 billion in PPP money as well as a little more in
excess liquidity. So, that's about $4 billion to $5 billion [indiscernible] (00:12:00) investments like NIM and ROA.
That said, at least the PPP program is profitable. Our proposed liquidity bill is not and it's costing us around $1
million to $2 million a quarter. We will share the liquidity at some point, slower than we'd like. But that said, we
don't have a vaccine yet either, so the additional insurance is still there out of an abundance of caution. We
believe that both PPP and our excess liquidity negatively impacted our third quarter NIM by 40 basis points. There
is a slide in the supplemental information that shows how we calculated that number.
Now, here's some good news in all that [indiscernible] (00:12:38), we believe our NIM after PPP and liquidity is
approximately 3.22%. This compares to a similar calculation last quarter of 3.19%. I know that's only 3 basis
points of earning asset improvement, but that 3 basis points is about $9 million in net interest income over the
next 12 months.
Now to fee income, I'll be really brief. Fees were more than $91 million for the quarter, an all-time record.
Everyone knows that 2020 is a powered up kind of year for mortgage, it's unbelievable. I'll talk about BHG in a
few minutes, but BHG, as I say, is killing it. As anticipated, wealth management rebounded based on
[indiscernible] (00:13:17) for investment services where fee revenues are received in a year arrears and are
based on market performance.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
So now to expenses. Personnel costs, as we stated in the press release, increased due to incentive accruals. As
we discussed on this call last quarter, our board did modify our annual cash plan such that we are providing an
increased opportunity to our associates so that we can earn up to 50% of their annual award with this
modification. Had the board not elected to do so, our incentive accrual would have been around 25% of our
associates' target award. We believe this will keep our associate base highly energized and motivated to ramp up
the operating performance of the firm going into next year. This additional incentive opportunity is based on hitting
a PPNR growth rate over 2019 exclusive of PPP, the liquidity bill and BHG. This is our attempt to quantify the
blocking and tackling of what our associates do every day without the distractions of PPP, liquidity or BHG.
Also, given its PPNR, the pandemic's impact on our credit book is excluded. So our credit officers can work with
these borrowers that might have been impacted by COVID in such a way that the credit officers can do what they
believe is best for the bank without impacting the goals of this incremental incentive opportunity, which is to
motivate these 2,500 people to ramp into 2021.
Briefly concerning CECL, eventually this slide will lose its prominence and be permanently relocated to the
supplemental part of the slide deck. Our reserve without PPP loans increased only 2 basis points to 1.43%. We
also increased our on-balance sheet reserves slightly. And as the slide notes, our unemployment forecast
improved slightly this quarter. So that, plus flattish loan growth, contributed to the modest reserve level.
The PPP program is back in the news. Not going to go through the entire slide, but we [indiscernible] (00:15:19)
out the smaller loan balances in the top right table. We're unsure as to how the SBA will manage the simplified
approval process or the timing for reimbursement, but suffice to say they carve out the smaller loans to make it
easier to get repay. We won't characterize the rigor of the forgiveness process as similar to the initial funding
process. But we are not optimistic that the larger loans will likely be a choppier process, at least that's what we
think for them. So we're expecting some net interest income left in the fourth quarter due to PPP forgiveness, but
expect first quarter of 2021, we'll see the greater lift.
This is a new slide and I discussed on – as I discussed on the expense slide regarding incentives, this serves as
the foundation for what we're trying to do as we ramp into 2021 with increased momentum. It was a great quarter
for us as PPNR per share increased above $2 for the quarter to $2.08 per share. Our goal is to try to ramp into
2021 with a mid-to-high single-digit PPNR per share growth, which we believe will compare very favorably to
peers. Aiding our PPNR growth this year has reduced incentives, so increasing our expense load for 2021 with
target payout will be a big headwind for 2021.
So for 2021, we are discussing how best to manage that as we close in on our targets for next year. A lot to do
with that is where we see the pandemic evolving over the next few months. I'm not going to go through this slide
in depth. Obviously, we have some idea about credit cost for the fourth quarter, but we continue to withhold. But
suffice it to say, we are optimistic about our shorter term prospects and once COVID is over, we love our longer
term prospects.
Now briefly about tangible equity. These are high-quality assets that will – there are high-quality assets that will
eventually exit our balance sheet. We believe we will manage back into the high 8s and low 9s by year-end or in
the first quarter of next year.
Quickly some comments on capital. We were hearing some banks are getting back into or initiating buyback
program. That's obviously on our agenda as well. Likely not a focus for us for the next couple of quarters, we

intend to seek reauthorization of our buyback program soon and then evaluate whether we should restart the
program.
We are a firm that works on many things. We are focused on growing earnings per share in an outsized way, but
we are also intentional about growing tangible book value per share. We've accomplished a lot of things since
year-end 2016; our balance sheet was $11.2 billion in assets at 2016 year-end. One thing we are proud of is that
since that time, we have increased our tangible book value per share by 72%.
We are second to only one other firm in our peer group during that same time period. The 75th percentile of the
peer group is at 37%, roughly half of our growth rate. To say I'm pleased with how this quarter ended up is an
understatement. As the execution of various tactics, I think, it was one of the best quarters we've had.
It's difficult to relay the significant effort that my colleagues are putting forth every day, working with clients and
solving their problems through this pandemic. It truly is remarkable. We all know it's a difficult operating
environment, loan growth is sluggish at best and the yield curve is [indiscernible] (00:18:50) of any bank, plus it's
a yield curve that we believe we'll have to – that we will have to live through for an extended period of time.
Politics are also very distracting and tend to rob us of our optimism. However, the bright spots from Pinnacle can't
be overemphasized at this time. Depositors continue to trust us and borrowers are figuring out how to manage
their businesses through this cycle. Discipline has never been more important. We don't know how the pandemic
will play out over the next few quarters, but we do like our franchise and where we do business and with whom we
do business.
We believe migration patterns are favoring more people and commercial businesses moving into Tennessee, the
Carolinas and Georgia. We like our competitive prospects. We are, as Terry will discuss shortly, we're a force in
Tennessee as well as in several markets in the Carolinas. Deposit share data would indicate that we are getting
there in Charlotte, Raleigh, Charleston and believe me, we will score in Atlanta.
Now to BHG. We've shown a similar slide before and it's intended to give you a snapshot of BHG's business flows
over time and more importantly, how they're holding up during the pandemic. The blue bars on the chart are
originations and have ramped up with more loans being funded. So, business flows remain strong. The green bar
represents loans, on which gain on sale has been recorded and [indiscernible] (00:20:13) sold to downstream
banks.
This is the traditional BHG model, with gain on sale revenues being generated. As you can see, both bars are at
record levels in the third quarter. Coupons have fluctuated over the last four years, but there's no discernible trend
up or down, seems like a mid-14% is the tip. As to buy rates, they fell to below 5% in the third quarter, lowest I
can recall since we became involved with Bankers' Healthcare Group.
One thing we have not emphasized enough is the small chart at the bottom right. Over 1,000 banks are now in
BHG's network and almost 600 acquired BHG's loans this year. That seems to be one of the strongest funding
platforms for a gain on sale model on the planet. There are firms out there trying to replicate this, but they got to
get real busy, real fast to find a funding platform like BHG.
It's taken 20 years, but it belongs to BHG, they own it, they developed it and they capitalize on it. So, from 30,000
feet, business flows remain incredibly healthy. Loan originations remain strong, loan sales are at record levels
and the funding platform is ready to take BHG's inventories.

The top-left chart, we've shown on several occasion the quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily over
the last few years, but particularly in 2020. They continue to refine our scorecards and increase the quality of the
borrowing base. The right chart again is the most powerful chart I think I can offer related to BHG's improving
credit quality. Looking at losses by vintage, losses continue to level out [indiscernible] (00:21:50) since origination,
thus pointing toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans. Pandemic-related events will
likely cause these loans to move up. But the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive.
As Terry mentioned concerning deferrals, as of June 30, last quarter, total deferrals represented about 15% of the
total book. [ph] Dennis (00:22:15) led the group with a 35% deferral rate. BHG communicated with these
borrowers frequently and worked to decrease the numbers meaningfully in the third quarter as deferrals are
essentially nonexistent at the end of the third quarter.
95% of the deferred loans are current and paying. Of the 5% that aren't current, about 25% of those are paying to
plan and paying as agreed. The remaining 75% or 3% to 4% of the deferral base is in early-stage delinquency, so
losses from these could materialize in the next two to three months. With that said, this has been crazy good.
We've updated charge-offs and reserve builds. These are for loans that BHG has sold to their network of
community banks. The green bar shows that currently they've got more than $3.4 billion in credit with banks who
have acquired their loans. The orange line shows the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the
recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks. For the nine months of 2020,
losses are running at 4.2%, basically consistent with the last few years.
Lastly, we said it last quarter and we'll say it again. It's been a big year for BHG and we anticipate big things for
the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, the credit markets improved to allow BHG's opportunity to execute on
their first securitization. Appreciate that securitization [indiscernible] (00:23:44) an investment grade ratings. This
allows BHG to continue to diversify its revenue stream away from [ph] going on sale (00:23:50) with more interest
income as well as provide another very competitive priced funding source.
So, wrapping up, loan pricing is holding. Deposit growth is remarkable. Deposit pricing is headed down. BHG is
making an another great year and credit is very much managed.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to talk about credit.

Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Harold. Good morning, everyone. From a traditional credit metrics of past dues, net charge-offs,
NPAs, and classified assets, Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to hold up well. That said, we understand we may
not yet have experienced COVID's full impact on our loan portfolio. Before I discuss our credit slides, first a few
comments about our defensive credit work completed during prior quarters. During the second quarter, we
regraded all loans greater than $1 million that had a payment deferral. We also regraded all hotel loans and all
CRE retail loans greater than $1 million regardless of the deferral status.
During the third quarter, our focus broadened to include the remaining sections of our portfolio that we did not
regrade during the second quarter. This extensive underwriting effort included our past CRE loans with exposures
greater than $2 million. The only risk grades we did not re-underwrite were our top two grades for our very best
loans, generally loans secured by cash or marketable securities.

For our watch list, criticized, classified loans, our view threshold was much lower at just $500,000. Our regrading
exercise was a tremendous amount of work for our lenders and credit staff, but we believe the benefit of quickly
identifying any credits materially impacted by COVID will help us in the long run. During the third quarter, we
reviewed about 2,500 loans, totaling approximately $10 billion in exposure.
Our work during the third quarter consisted of collecting current borrower monthly financial statements,
conducting a survey questionnaire of our C&I clients, collecting data points in our CRE loans. The results of our
third quarter credit work is encouraging. At the completion of regrading work, the newly identified classified loans
in the quarter was only $33.6 million. But even more positive is that the net change in classified loans for the third
quarter was a decrease of $27 million. Our criticized assets had a very modest increase from the second quarter
to third quarter of $70 million.
A few comments about our hotel book, you'll recall during the second quarter we moved approximately 78% of our
hotel balances into a criticized risk grade. On a very positive note, since the second quarter, many of our hotel
borrowers have reported improving occupancy levels. Similar to the second quarter, we conducted a four-
question survey of C&I clients in mid-September. The survey population was [ph] 262 (00:27:07) clients with total
loan balances of $852 million.
This time the C&I survey was targeted to our lowest [ph] pass (00:27:14) grade credit in a variety of segments like
entertainment, restaurants, [ph] physicians (00:27:21). Three of our questions were asking the borrowers estimate
of revenue for third and fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The fourth question was regarding months of liquidity on hand to cover operating expenses.
The results were, 68% said third quarter revenue would be between 75% to 100% of third quarter 2019. 74% said
fourth quarter 2020 revenue would be between 75% and 100% of fourth quarter 2019. 76% said first quarter 2021
revenues will be between 75% to 100% of first quarter 2021. And finally, 62% reported having seven months or
greater of liquidity to cover operating expenses.
Pinnacle continues its approach of a well-balanced and granular loan portfolio. Given the extent and coverage of
Pinnacle's defensive work during the second and third quarters, we believe we have identified those borrowers
that have been extensively impacted by COVID.
Risk grade migration during the third quarter was modest. Through the efforts of our early problem identification
and a very strong special assets team, Pinnacle's classified assets decreased during the third quarter. NPAs
increased just 3 basis points from the second quarter, and net charge-offs increased modestly from 10 to 23 basis
points.
In March, Pinnacle began proactively reaching out to clients with loan payment deferrals. We believe many of our
clients accepted the offer of a payment deferral in March and April simply because the impact of COVID was
unknown to them. The table on this page illustrates that our loans with the payment deferral have dramatically
decreased from 18.7% of loans as of June 30 to just 3.1% by end of third quarter. By mid-October, our deferrals
had decreased further to just 1.8% of total loans.
A few comments about our 4013 loan modification, by September 30, we had executed on just a handful of 4013
loan modifications totaling approximately $49 million. Our 4013 loan modifications are not a one size fits all.
Modifications are tailored to fit the circumstances of the loan and the borrower. For illustration purposes, I'll offer a
couple of examples of modification discussions with hotel clients.

My first example, we met with the borrower and agreed to an interest only period to June 30, 2021, conditioned
upon the establishment of an escrow reserve of nine months of interest payments with Pinnacle. We also
implemented a LIBOR floor of 75 basis points. This was a good solution for us both.
My second example was a long-term client with several hotel rooms that had a deferral of principal plus interest.
The borrower requested a longer interest-only period. We replied we're open to a modification provided we
institute a interest rate floor. The customer declined our offer due to the rate floor paid all deferred interest and
agreed to resume regular P&I payments. Our thoughtful negotiation resulted in avoiding the 4013 loan
modification. Naturally, there are many more variations in these two examples, but our intent with modifications is
to help the client bridge to the other side of COVID, but also explore ways to improve the bank's position.
Pinnacle's approach to hospitality sector has always been a disciplined conservative approach of banking hotel
sponsors who are well-capitalized and have a long successful track record of operation, a few attributes to
[indiscernible] (00:31:39) conservative hotel underwriting, weighted average LTV of just 55%. Weighted average
2019 debt service coverage was 2.1 for stabilized properties. 91% had personal guarantees. All of our hotels are
open for business.
Prior to COVID, we only had one non-performing SBA hotel loan of just $3 million that we discussed last quarter.
During the third quarter, we moved just three hotel loans into a classified risk grade. The collective balance on
these three newly identified hotel loans totaled just $5.3 million. The combined LTV for the three is just 40%.
Business center, resort, high-end and airport properties are under the greatest amount of stress. Our exposure in
these categories is limited to a few in the business centers and/or airport categories.
This page contains data for our hotel loans. Approximately 74% of our hotel loans are in the extended stay,
economy and limited service sectors. Many of these types of hotels can cover operating expense and interest
expense with occupancy in the 45% to 55% range. As illustrated by the three graphs on this page, our limited
service, full service, and extended stay borrowers have reported improving trends in occupancy since the low
point recorded in April.
This slide provides details of our loans in the restaurant sector. It groups together exposures to real estate
developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators. Our restaurant exposure is
just 3% of our loan book. [indiscernible] (00:33:36) very successful PPP program provided $179 million in cushion
to our clients. Loan deferrals to our restaurant clients have decreased from 21% of the portfolio at second quarter
to a modest 3.6%. Of our 20 largest non-owner occupied CRE loan leased to restaurants, none have a payment
deferral. Our quick service segment is made up of names like Taco Bell, Sonic, Wendy's and KFC.
This slide provides insight into our retail portfolio. It consists of both retail store operators and commercial real
estate loans leased to retail operators. Loans with deferrals have decreased from 18% at second quarter to only
half of 1%. Pinnacle successful PPP program provided $189 million of cushion to our clients.
Approximately 23% of our CRE term loans are single tenant properties with tenants like Tractor Supply, Dollar
General, O'Reilly Auto Parts, 7-Eleven and Walgreens. Pinnacle Bank has always maintained a very limited
appetite for power retail centers. We only have six power retail centers in our entire portfolio. The primary tenant
for these properties are names like Walmart, Harris Teeter, Hobby Lobby and DICK'S Sporting Goods.
For our CRE retail construction book, 65% are built-to-suit single tenant to names like Tractor Supply, Dollar
General and 7-Eleven. Our retail strip center construction loans had an average loan size of approximately $44
million and had 75% of the space pre-leased.

This slide will provide some insight into the composition of our C&I retail book and the owner-occupied real estate
secured retail book. Similar to our CRE retail book, it is very granular.
This slide provides some insight into our entertainment portfolio. Pinnacle's entertainment portfolio was
approximately 3% of total loans. Over 50% of our entertainment exposure is in the music publishing space to
finance the acquisition of song catalogs. Each catalog of songs is made up of thousands of well-seasoned
diversified songs that are stable from an earning standpoint. Revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from
music streaming fees paid from firms like Spotify, Apple, Amazon and terrestrial radio. Pinnacle's very successful
PPP program provided $54 million of cushion to our clients.
To summarize, the present status of our loan portfolio was that of tempered optimism given Pinnacle's
comprehensive loan review and regrading during the second and third quarter. Net charge-offs continue to remain
in an acceptable range. Our level of classified assets is stable. Loan deferrals have declined to just 1.8% by mid-
October. In September 30, loan delinquencies were just 11 basis points. While we take a measure of comfort in
these metrics, we acknowledge that the duration of COVID and no second fiscal stimulus package could alter
these metrics in the coming quarters.
Harold, now back to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay, Tim. I'll take it from here. As part of our Q1 earnings call, I talked to you about moving our firm from an
offensive to a defensive posture. That included things like building a huge liquidity position on our balance sheet,
adding $0.25 billion in Tier 1 capital, nearly tripling our loan loss allowance since year end, and [ph] scarring
(00:37:51) our loan book aggressively, gathered financial information from borrowers to ascertain risk and
respond appropriately.
It also includes things like de-emphasizing our continuous recruitment revenue producers. Never mind that the
previous momentum in our recruitment pipelines resulted in bringing home 56 revenue producers year-to-date.
So, all that defensive work has been completed and I'm not telling you that there's no further need to be
defensive. But I am telling you that the human resources that we utilized on those defensive efforts that grew in
borrower-by-borrower assessment as an example. We now take that resource and use it on more offensive sorts
of an issue.
So, as we move forward, number one of course is that we'll continue to be in active dialogue with our existing
borrowers to aggressively respond to changing risk profiles. Number two, Harold has already discussed the
upcoming maturities in our wholesale deposit book that will facilitate the unwinding of our excess liquidity as the
pandemic subside.
Thirdly, during the course of this year, we have specifically launched four broad initiatives intended to accelerate
our PPNR. They include, one, proactively and aggressively lowering the cost of our existing deposit book. We
intend to drive it below 25 basis points by year-end.
Two, gathering additional low-cost deposits. We have built and launched a number of deposit products with
enormous potential to structurally alter our deposit mix over time. These include value-added products like
[indiscernible] (00:39:37) account for property managers, specialized expertise in captive insurance accounts, as
well as expertise surrounding large non-profits.

Number three, obtaining floors on loans as you heard from Harold, we've made great progress in that area, really
obtaining floors on roughly 98% of new, renewed loans. And then number four, focusing on the tremendous share
of wallet opportunities that we have to provide additional financial services to our existing clients that are currently
purchasing from someone else.
We currently have meaningful traction on all four of these, which should produce significant growth in PPNR or
EPS for some time to come. And finally because all of that heavy lifting that's behind us, we are now [ph] intent on
seizing (00:40:25) what we expect to be a once in a generation market share movement.
Specifically, [ph] Greenwich Research (00:40:33) indicates nearly a third of mid-market businesses intend to
switch, not that they're frustrated, but they intend to switch. They found that primarily to the responsiveness or
lack of responsiveness at our larger competitors, which just reinforces the power of our client-friendly approach to
deferrals and our nimbleness on PPP. And so, it's our intent to aggressively pursue this opportunity.
[ph] Guys those (00:41:02) that you know our strategic approach as a challenger brand, we're purposeful about
creating a work environment that excites our associates, [ph] believing (00:41:11) that if we're successful later,
they will create an engaging experience for our clients, and of course, [indiscernible] (00:41:20) result is the
shareholders [indiscernible] (00:41:22).
So, let me start with the exciting our associates. Just in the last 12 months, we've been recognized by American
Bankers the 13th best bank in America to work for and includes a lot of small and privately held banks in the
category of banks greater than $10 billion in assets, we are the single best bank in America to work for. According
to the Great Place to Work Institute and Fortune Magazine, we are the fourth best financial services firm in
America to work for behind some giants like American Express. Same group would have us as the fourth best
place to work for women. That's a powerful spot for us to be. We're the fourth best place for millennials in the
country to work. We're the 12th best place for parents. We're winning best place to work awards in Memphis,
Chattanooga, Knoxville, [indiscernible] (00:42:13), North Carolina, Roanoke, Virginia, Charlotte, and the State of
South Carolina.
And so the chart that you're looking at here demonstrates that we've in fact been able to translate that excitement
among ourselves, it's truly differentiating client experience. These are the major Tennessee and North Carolina
markets that [ph] our businesses will sail (00:42:33) from $1 million to $500 million. The farther to the right
[indiscernible] (00:42:38) experiences and the higher on the charge-offs, the more market share you have.
So, let's start with the top left with Nashville where we de novo 20 years ago next week, as you can see, our client
satisfaction is the farthest to the right indicating a differentiated experience and our market share is the highest
indicating that experience has resulted in a number one share position. We're about replicating that phenomenon
in every major market we serve. And as you can see with one exception our client satisfaction among major
competitors is the best in the market. And so, it seems obvious to me that we're in the best position to grow share
of all the major competitors in our market.
As further evidence that our [ph] – the service (00:43:27) model yields market share pickup, you're looking at the
recently released deposit share data from FDIC. For each market, you have a listing of the top banks showing
their market share rank, their year-over-year growth rate, and how that growth rate ranks in the market. So, again
you start at the top left with Nashville, we're in the number one share position and we're still the second fastest-
growing bank in that market. I think a lot of people are being concerned that the large numbers we give, but you
can see even in a number one share position, the flywheel is spinning pretty rapidly.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
As you skim across the page, in Knoxville, we de novo out there in 2007. We climbed into the number 4 share
position and we're the fastest-growing bank in that market. In Chattanooga, we bought CapitalMark Bank & Trust,
which was a de novo from the 2008 time period. We bought it in 2015. We've now climbed into the number 4
share position there and the fastest-growing bank in that market.
In Memphis, we bought Magna Bank. That was a de novo in year 2000 or so. We've substantially moved up in the
market share chart. We moved up two more slots this year, up to the sixth position. We're the fastest-growing
bank in that market.
Looking at Charlotte, North Carolina, we've moved up three slots there into the seventh position. We're the
second fastest-growing bank in that market. In Greensboro, we're in the number 4 share position. Raleigh, we're
in the 13th position, but we're the second fastest-growing bank in that market. That is a fabulous market
opportunity that we're working hard to seize.
Charleston, South Carolina, we're in the 8th position, but the third fastest growing. Roanoke, Virginia, we're in the
third market share position and the fastest-growing bank in that market.
So it seems adamant to me, first of all, that there is a once in a generation market share opportunity coming, and
secondly, we're the [ph] singularly (00:45:28) best position to be a winner, which of course results in outsized
earnings growth over time.
And perhaps further substantiation of why we expect the outsized growth is [ph] we're going to exit (00:45:40) this
recession is our track record. The bars on the left represent annualized growth from 2001 to 2007, post 9/11. And
[indiscernible] (00:45:51), we were a smaller bank coming off a smaller base [ph] grew (00:45:53) seven times the
industry through the extended period is meaningful. And on the right, on the larger base from 2011 to 2019, post
Great Recession, we grew six times the industry.
And so to sum up what we've talked about here today, the visibility we now have on asset quality as a result of the
extensive regrading work that we have done is very encouraging. EPS, PPNR, and revenues were all exhibiting
strong growth quarter-over-quarter. BHG is showcasing its distinctive model and highlighting what makes it
different, more or less comparison. And lastly, having completed the bulk of the defensive work that we set out to
accomplish over the last two quarters, we believe we're uniquely positioned to pick up meaningful market share
on a sound basis, which we believe will result in outsized earnings growth.
So, operator, I'll stop there and we'll be glad to take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Stephen Scouten at Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So, Terry, you gave a lot of good color there about the market share takeaway opportunity. Obviously, you guys
had a great track record there. I'm wondering specifically when you think that really ramps up from a talent
acquisition standpoint again. And is that the primary medium for which you think that will occur, or do you start
thinking more about M&A and some of these markets as well to kind of capitalize on all that opportunity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think, Steve, we have always and we continue to view ourselves to be primarily organic growers. You can look at
those historical charts and say we have mixed in acquisition and I think done it successfully. I wouldn't be
surprised if we did that, but I just want to be clear we primarily think about organic growth. Your question is a
great one. The market share movement, to be honest with you, I wouldn't be for [indiscernible] (00:48:12) and try
to meet a bunch of people, [indiscernible] (00:48:16), run an ad campaign, sales promotions, all that.
We don't do any of that stuff. It's all dependent on getting relationship manager, experienced relationship
managers from other banks, having them move those books of business to us. And so, that would continue to be
the [ph] approach (00:48:32). I think there are two things that are important about that phenomenon there.
Number one, I think I indicated early on that 22% of our existing FAs had been here for less than two years, that's
enormous market share taking capacity.
We've – as I mentioned, I'm switching terms on here, but I'll go back to revenue producers [ph] instead our
(00:48:58) relationship managers, which is a broader term, include mortgage originators and brokers and other
sorts of revenue producers. But among those revenue producers, even trying to shut down or tamp down the
hiring, we've added 56 revenue producers this year. And so all of that hiring that has already occurred, it is still in
relatively early stage maturation represents enormous share taking opportunity.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
The second aspect of that idea here is we are finding much more vulnerability today in the market than we would
have over the last several quarters, particularly as some of these larger banks continue to struggle with regulatory
issues, margin integration issues and so forth. And so, we feel like we've got a number of folks that we had at
some stage of recruitment. As I mentioned, we did tamp it down, slow it down, a lot of those folks are beginning to
contact us and say they want to reconsider.
And so, [indiscernible] (00:49:58), but you get the ideas primarily about organic growth is primarily about market
share movement by relationship managers. And we've got a big queue of folks that are in early stage maturation
already on the books and we're optimistic about our ability to hire more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Very helpful. And then, can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the market demand
side? There seems to be a view that metro areas are going to be in a bad spot for the years to come. But you
guys are in kind of non-metro MSAs that are maybe smaller, mid-size metro MSAs where I think we'd still see
growth in the southeast. So, can you really touch on what you're seeing there and maybe especially in Nashville
where there really seems to be this view that Nashville is just music and tourism?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, thank you for that question. I think let's talk about loan demand, current loan demand. I do think loan
demand is near zero. I mean it's a little better than that but not much. It's pretty tight here right now. But if you
think about it, the reason I think for that is obvious. One, you got a lot of people saying, well, right now I don't feel
like taking a big risk. Number two, I got tons of liquidity on my balance sheet. You've got a bunch of PPP money. I
mean, there are a lot of reasons why loan demand would be just a little soft and likely to be that over a few
quarters, which is the criticality for us as this market share takeaway, that's the case for why we think we will
grow.
But if you're asking about the view over any extended period of time for a market like Nashville, I think we had an
analyst that actually conducted sort of a Investor Day, if you will, investor call with the Chamber of Commerce.
And I think they came away – I don't want to put words in their mouth, I think they came away very encouraged
and excited about the potential, what's in the business development pipeline.
As you know, what drives growth in this market has been corporate relocations. And what drives corporate
relocations is primarily tax rate. And so, my belief is that phenomenon is going to continue for an extended period
of time.
Steve, I know travel is no doubt limited. Tourism is definitely down. But I'll tell you this, if you could make it to
Nashville, you would still see a large number of [ph] cranes (00:52:19) that scares some people, but it doesn't
particularly scare me because if we believe that this market is going to continue to grow at an outsized pace, I'll
spare you the Chamber of Commerce speech, but I promise you the tax rate and tax implications are likely to
expand that benefit to markets like Nashville, [indiscernible] (00:52:42).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Perfect. And maybe one last real quick one for me, on the loan loss reserve percentage, I'm wondering –
obviously, this is probably a near-term event, but as net charge-offs probably flow through a little bit from the

pandemic and we see credit normalize over the next [ph] who knows (00:53:00) three, four, five quarters, where
can we see that loan losses kind of normalize in a post-CECL world? Is the kind of [ph] 109 level (00:53:06) we
saw at 1Q 2020, is that the right way to think about it as things normalize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, I'm not sure where that – where it's going to end up. What we're doing is trying to keep it where it is
right now. We don't think it's a good time. We're trying to see it go down. But eventually we think as charge-offs
materialize, and I got to hand it off to Tim's group. I got to hand it off to the centralized underwriting groups.
They're digging up under all kind of the rocks trying to find out [ph] where (00:53:37) the quality and the lost
content this book is.
And so, we anticipate that we'll see some charge-offs materialize, not that we've identified any of them yet, we
haven't, but we just think that's common. And then towards the end of next year, we likely will see this reserve
kind of need to get some relief, now unless depending on what unemployment forecast look like, but we're not
seeing the lost content materialize in the loan book like we would have otherwise thought it was going to
materialize back in March.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
You'd mentioned the market share gain opportunity, Terry. Do you think one of those opportunities would be
specific to first citizens in North Carolina as they are distracted with the [ph] CRT (00:54:55) partnership over the
next two or three years? That's my first question.
My second question is can you give us an update on what you're seeing in your Atlanta de novo? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. I do think there's likely to be some opportunity in that transaction. At this point, I'm
not – I guess [ph] let me (00:55:23) characterize it this way. My excitement about that opportunity would be less
than the excitement I have about the turmoil in companies like [indiscernible] (00:55:33) and those sorts of
companies. The vulnerability there seems larger and seems more timely. And those guys are saying – you know
this and variably when you get involved in integration work, there will be an internal focus that will create some
vulnerability and we'll certainly try to seize on it. But I view those other opportunities to be still better, I guess, is
maybe the way to characterize that.
I believe in the Atlanta market that we're doing well. I don't mind [indiscernible] (00:56:13). I don't have exactly the
numbers in front of me but my guess is today there's about $70 million in outstanding. There's probably north of
$100 million in commitments that are out. Some of those are [indiscernible] (00:56:31) construction kind of things
and may fund up over time, so it's not all immediate stuff. But that pipeline of commitments that exists that we'll
have funding is pretty large. And I think if Rob Garcia were talking to you about the rest of his pipeline, in other
words deals that he has in the pipe that he believes he is going to close [indiscernible] (00:56:51) that momentum
is building as well.
And of course, the real measure or the real catalyst I guess might be a better word for our success is the hiring.
And so I think, Rob, again would tell you that his hiring pipeline is full. Again, [indiscernible] (00:57:10). He's got
about 17 associates down there today I think, about 4 which might be classified as retail branch-based
associates. The others would be either financial advisors or credit analyst or something that's supporting the
revenue stream there.
And again, it looks like to me that pipeline is really [ph] full (00:57:34). We will likely to have an announcement or
two in the next week or two that I could be really – I'd put in a high profile, higher category. So, again, I think we're
very encouraged and [indiscernible] (00:57:52) Rob is doing a great job. I think the results are materializing.

If I could follow-up one question on BHG. So, that performance, obviously, has been really terrific. What – who
were the most stressed borrowers in the BHG sub-segment? They are still dentist or what are you seeing among
their group of borrowers? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the dentists are still probably the most stressed. But as it sits today, I'm not sure of any market
where they've got loans that are not permitting elective surgery. So, I think all the dentists are open and I think all

the surgeons are open. The optometrists were a little stressed in the second quarter. But, I think by and large their
business flows are coming back.
I can dig on that some more for you, Jennifer. But, right now, I'm not sure that I can discern any particular
segment based on the reports I get from BHG that there's one that's more stressful than other.

is – this could be a once in a generation opportunity to take market share. And just given the success you've had
hiring people and using Atlanta as an example, yeah, should we really expect to think maybe you go on the
offensive now and target some additional geographies? Obviously, some of the bigger competitors you mentioned
do business in more than just Atlanta. Are there opportunities for you to expand into new geographies and really
take that hiring model and accelerate it a little faster? And would that turn into potentially a different expense level
for 2021 in the near term while that's building out?

Jared, that's a fabulous question. And honestly, I guess I might characterize it this way, we might be tempted by

opportunity in markets like Charlotte, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina. I think Raleigh, North Carolina, was
just highlighted as the hottest real estate market in the United States.
It's a fabulous market whatever metric you want to look at. I think you can see we're in a 13th share position, but
we're the fastest-growing bank and so my objective is [indiscernible] (01:01:17) what's happening in Charlotte,
what's happening in Raleigh, what's happening in Charleston in particular, those three markets. That's where we
really want to invest. That's where we want to grow [indiscernible] (01:01:28).
And so, I don't mean to say I can't do anything else if I'm doing that, but I do want to say that that's the most
important thing for us to do to seize that opportunity. That is a grand growth opportunity. And again, I know
sometimes people are not as interested in things like the distinctive service experience but that's [ph] been
(01:01:51) a powerful, and important point, we've spent time getting that service [ph] wage (01:01:54) right and it's
now time to harvest that in those high-growth markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And that sure goes back to the 22% of hires that have been there less than two years give a lot in those
markets. So, you feel that they can start to really make some [indiscernible] (01:02:11)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Those [indiscernible] (01:02:13) also think as I mentioned if – again just trying to be candid about where the
opportunity is. I think the hiring opportunities are particularly strong [indiscernible] (01:02:23) and to maybe a
slightly lesser degree, but I think picking up through this. And so, again, those Carolina markets of course are
filled with wells and some form of BB&T or [indiscernible] (01:02:43).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then shifting a little bit to BHG and looking at the growth that they've had in recourse.
Are they subject to CECL? Do they need to build that recourse over the same way that you're building out an
allowance? Or is that not necessarily reflective of what their expectations for full losses are at this point in time,
they have maybe a little more flexibility?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. There's no doubt that this is helping them get towards a CECL number at some point. CECL for them, I
think, is a 2024 issue and they're going down the path now of trying to analyze and quantify and build the models
to get to a CECL-compliant credit loss reserve. But I'm not sure where that number is going to actually end up.

Okay. But we shouldn't necessarily look at the recourse being significantly higher than the losses at this point as a
direct tie in to where they think the total loss content is today?

Harold R. Carpenter A

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then on the issue with the success of having that securitization, do you think that 2021, you'll
see that strategy shift back more towards beginning to emphasize securitization and maybe some on balance
sheet opportunities more so than straight gain on sale? Or will it be a – continue to be a good mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think they'll continue the good mix. I think they believe that they will be back at the securitization game
early next year. So they're ramping up to probably do another issuance, call it, January and February.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hello. Thanks. Just following on the questions on BHG. In terms of the revenue profile, you've – somewhat longer
term guidance about BHG in the past and as we kind of emerge from COVID, it seems like BHG is going very
strongly, the mix of securitization versus traditional placements is kind of what it is. What do you – what should we
be thinking about in terms of the revenue or earnings profile there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think what we're looking at for next year is probably a high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number for
them next year. We believe they've got the momentum to deliver that. So, that would be what our current thinking
is, Brock.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Okay. And Harold, I heard the guide on funding costs. I guess on the opposite side, where do you see securities
yields trending over time? And within that securities book, we've seen a number of other banks really look to ramp
that up, whether it's now or possibly waiting until after the election and hoping for a steeper curve. But should we
look for a really sharply higher balance there given that loan growth is a bit muted right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we're going to be focused on building the loan book or executing on any kind of leverage
strategy to take some of this liquidity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Building the securities book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Oh, I'm sorry. Building the securities book, that's what I meant. I just said the wrong word, building the securities
book to execute on a leverage strategy. Bond yields right now look to be pretty good. We've done a lot of
municipal acquisitions. We think a lot of that will hang with us. But to say that we're going to develop a strategy to
kind of ramp up the bond book by 20% or even 10%, I just don't see that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And those yields, do you have a sense of where they could drift assuming rates stick where they are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Where they are? I think our municipal book will help us hold yields. But I can't help but believe that we're going to
see some deterioration in bond yields probably over the next several quarters. But I don't think it's going to be that
significant.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
To start on the new incentive, can you give more color on exactly what the new incentive is? And is it a 4Q 2020
incentive or is it a full year 2020 in terms of results?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes, it's for the whole year. We implemented it and I think that our company approved it late July. So, what we
tried to do was determine what a reasonable growth rate and PPNR would be for 2020 over 2019, and then try to
figure out how to hit that number. And so, it gives us some consistent messaging with not only revenue producers,
but the whole – all 25,000 people.
And it keeps people in the game because obviously with the first quarter reserve build and then again in the
second quarter, 80% of our incentive was tied to EPS growth. And so, that effectively knocked us out of the game
for any kind of cash bonus this year. So, we were trying to create something, although not get them all the way
back to the start line, just trying to get us to at least to a 50% target level to develop some plan that will help us
not only this year, but more importantly in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And Harold, what growth rate do you need to maximize that incentive?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
What we did and we'll talk about it in the proxy, what we did is we looked at where the peers – our peers were and
try to consider, you know, the anomalies within the peer group and said, okay, what does it take to get into the top
quartile of that peer group?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then, just following up on all the commentaries around the market
share gain, Terry, I think I've asked you this before but what exactly was it that the larger banks had done with the
PPP program to upset so many customers? Did they just turn down people for the loans, they weren't available?
Can you give more color on what's created this opportunity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Again, I want to cite what I hear from Greenwich and then I'll give you my own personal commentary, which
might be [indiscernible] (01:10:00), I don't know. But Greenwich would say that the big banks were unresponsive,
many of them were slow to get their systems up. There was very little communication between the bank and the
borrowers. All that led to mass confusion. As the money ran out, it led to mass frustration. And I think just sort of
the impersonal nature of how that process worked at the big companies versus the more personalized approach

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
that smaller banks typically used, where as an example for us, I can't recite now how many webinars we held, but
we had thousands of borrowers attending our webinars, many of whom weren't even our customers because that
became the place you go to get information about how do you apply for this, how does the application work, what
are the issues to think through, what kind of documentation do I need? And so if you're not supplied that
information, you'll create lots of apprehension among your borrowers and they're feeling underserved.
And so, again, I think this phenomenon of the PPP process, the deferral process is – Steve, as we've talked
before, [indiscernible] (01:11:21) the spectrum on how to handle the deferral – and I promise you, I'm not acting
like either one of them is really bad or really good. I'm just telling you what we did and why we did it and why I
think it benefits us. At one end of the spectrum, you could say, look, this [indiscernible] (01:11:39) you want a
deferral, you come down here and bring me a bunch of financial information and give me some more guarantees
and put up [indiscernible] (01:11:48) and so forth and I don't give you a deferral.
And that's not an irresponsible thing to do. I mean, if you're a credit person, you're thinking about improving your
borrowing base and trying to minimize losses and so forth. That would be a tag you could take. Our view was to
give somebody a deferral for 90 days in the middle of the time where nobody knew what it was, didn't
substantially increase our credit risk and it made our borrowers love us. And so that was the reason that we went
in that direction.
And so, again, I'm just sort of rambling about two or three things that are sort of different in the approach. But if
you had to get it down to a word on one side, it's a more personalized service that puts borrowers at ease and
makes them feel like you're looking after them in a less personalized kind of service that creates apprehension
among borrowers, which leads to frustration, irritation and so forth. And so that'd be my characterization of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Yeah, that's helpful color. Maybe just one final one on BHG. Given the deferral trends, I was surprised that
the recourse reserve ratio increased, to me, it was modest, but the reserves up $200 million in the quarter. The
ratio was up. Why would that have gone higher given these really impressive deferral trends? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. So, keep in mind they're still a private company and there's a lot more qualitative assessments going on
then with perhaps a CECL model like we have to develop or have to roll out that's more or less subjected. So, I
think what BHG is doing is they're just anticipating, probably doing some concerns and analyzing and building a
reserve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for all the color.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Cath. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:13:54) follow up on your PPNR commentary and outlook. So, Harold, you talked about wanting
to grow the PPNR, I think well, I don't know if you can mention that you wanted to have taken this mid-single digit
growth rate in 2021 off of 2020. But you're at least looking to grow PPNR as we move into next year. And so, how
should we think about that as we think about PPP rolling off and mortgage kind of normalizing? Do you think even
with those two headwinds, PPNR can still grow next year or is it more PPNR per share can grow because it's an
active buyback activity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. First of all, I want to make sure we understand that – what I talked about during the slide was that we've
excluded PPP and BHG and the liquidity build. So, we're, kind of, quantifying that – those numbers and excluding
that from the calculation of PPNR growth.
So, you're right, how does one anticipate what PPP is going to do to our numbers this year or next year? And so,
we didn't think it was fair to put that into an incentive target. And then all of a sudden, something happened with
the SBA, they make it more onerous, which we think they will. And the PPP revenue is not materialized. So, we
go through a process to eliminate that.
So, what we're trying to do is get down to blocking and tackling. And that's how we come up with our anticipated
PPNR growth rate. Now, we shoot for top quartile performance, it's a lot more difficult to get that out of the peers.
So, that's not exactly apples and apples when we start comparing to the peers, but we would believe that the
revenue contribution that we're getting from PPP is greater from – than a lot of our peers are going to get. So,
that's probably a little bit of a headwind when you start talking about peer rankings for us. Does that make sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And so – but your – it does. And so, I was just thinking, sure, your commentary on a single-digit growth, PPNR
was more around the incentive plan for this year. Not as much on outlook for what you can do in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
And I – well, that is true. Single to high, mid to single – mid to high-single-digit growth and looking at what the
peers were doing next year, it's likely to be a similar number for next year.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

That excludes PPP, BHG and liquidity for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. And then also on the expense side, so you've guided for
expenses to be flat to down. Is that inclusive of the incentive comp catch-up this quarter? So, just look at bottom
line expenses and that's the number that kind of flat to down next quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. The third quarter incentive had to catch us up to 75% of the whole year. So, we don't have as far to go in
the fourth quarter with the incentive group.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. But still you're – so in what scenario are expenses flat in 4Q, another $90 million? I'm sorry, I'm
looking at [indiscernible] (01:17:28) another $144 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah I think – well, I think what's going to drive it primarily is the incentive accrual because PPNR incentive is, call
it, $15 million and I have to get 75% of that into the third quarter number and I only have to get 25% of that into
the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Got it. So, really expenses should be down next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q

but do you have what criticized did linked-quarter?
