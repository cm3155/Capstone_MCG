Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines
have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Wasserstrom
Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Katie, and welcome, everyone, to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation,
which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that
appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation.
Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the
Q&A session, you'll be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After a follow-up
question, please return to the queue.
Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Roger C. Hochschild
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We
generated robust revenue growth and strong earnings, while advancing several strategic initiatives. This solid
performance reflects the strength of our integrated digital banking and payments model and our focus on
managing the business while investing for growth amidst an increasingly fluid macroeconomic backdrop.
Let's turn to the summary on slide 3. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion after tax, or
$3.96 per share. Our operating metrics in the second quarter remained very strong. Loan growth increased by
13% from the prior year, driven by a combination of higher sales and strong new account growth, and our asset
quality remains solid across all products, reflecting our focus on prime lending and our approach to underwriting
and credit management.
We also advanced several strategic priorities in the quarter. In our Payment Services segment, we continue to
expand our global acceptance through new partnerships. In June, we announced a network alliance in Italy with
BANCOMAT, one of Europe's largest payment networks. This should provide our customers with access to
merchants in Italy through BANCOMAT's extensive acquirer relationships. This partnership represents a
significant advancement in our acceptance across Western Europe, and we remain committed to expanding our
international merchant coverage.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
In our Digital Banking segment, our combination of industry-leading customer service and compelling products
continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. We were recently awarded the highest ranking in customer
satisfaction by J.D. Power, among mobile, credit card apps and websites. We also achieved J.D. Power's top
customer satisfaction with checking accounts for direct retail banks. This recognition underscores our customer
service model, which, combined with our compelling cashback rewards and no-fee products, create a value
proposition that we believe others will struggle to match. For this reason, we're confident that we are well-
positioned to generate substantial growth and shareholder value over the long term.
Notwithstanding our strong performance, we continue to closely monitor today's evolving economic environment.
Slide 4 provides some views on the current macro conditions. Measures of inflation remain persistently high and
the Federal Reserve has signaled its intent to address this through restrictive monetary policy. Our business
model has somewhat of a natural hedge against inflation, as higher expenses are largely offset by the contribution
inflation makes to our sales volumes. And because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive, rate hikes
improve our outlook for spread income despite driving higher funding costs.
Perhaps more significantly, tighter monetary policy may have raised the risk of an economic recession, but
behavior and trends from our consumer loan portfolio currently do not suggest that a downturn is imminent. Our
credit metrics remain strong and sales are robust even as our customers maintain high payment rates. Similarly,
most labor market measures indicate employment conditions remain broadly supportive of consumer financial
health and credit performance.
Nonetheless, should there be changes in macroeconomic conditions, we'll make the appropriate adjustments. Our
through-the-cycle underwriting considers all stages of the credit cycle, including downturns, and our history of
conservative credit management positions us well for any future periods of economic stress.
Our actions during the recent pandemic are a good example of how nimbly we can respond to changing
circumstances. We also maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position. Our current level of common equity
Tier 1 is 14.2%, well above our internal target and regulatory minimums. And as John will detail, our reserves
capture our estimate of losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio.
This brings me to one topic about which we want to make you aware. As we addressed in our press release, we
are temporarily suspending our share repurchase program in light of an internal investigation being conducted by
a board-appointed independent special committee. This investigation concerns our student loan servicing
practices and related compliance matters. And while we cannot comment further at this time, I can say this matter
was contemplated as John reaffirms our expense guidance for the year.
In summary, while macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain, we continue to advance our strategic
goals and are benefiting from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin and
slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over the forecast horizon, while our
reserves and high level of capital position us to withstand a range of macroeconomic environments.
I'll now turn the call over to John to review key aspects of our financial results in more detail.

John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide 5. As Roger
indicated, we reported net income of $1.1 billion, which was 35% lower year-over-year. However, I'd like to call
out two items. The first is that in the second quarter of last year, we had a $729 million unrealized gain on our

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
equity investments compared to a $42 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our earnings would have been
$4.07 per share in the current quarter.
Second, the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year due to a $110 million reserve build in the
current quarter compared to a $321 million reserve released in the prior year. The current quarter reserve build
was primarily driven by higher loan receivables. Excluding the impacts of these two items, our profit before tax
and reserves would've been up 38% year-over-year.
Moving to slide 6. Net interest income was up $311 million, or 14%, driven by higher average receivables and
improved net interest margin. NIM was 10.94%, up 26 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points
sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin reflects the higher
prime rate and favorable funding mix, partially offset by increased promotional balances and higher funding costs.
Receivables growth was driven by card, which increased 15% year-over-year from strong sales and robust new
account growth last year and into this year. In the quarter, the payment rate increased 40 basis points and
remains more than 500 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. We continue to expect that the normalization
in payment rate will be modest this year and will continue through the back half of 2023.
Organic student loans increased 4%, reflecting solid growth in originations. Personal loans were up 4%, reflecting
a return to growth. We view this as a validation of our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this
product over the past several quarters, and we believe we are competitively positioned to grow, particularly
relative to some non-bank originators.
In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.
Increases in our savings balances offset the runoff in higher cost CDs. Our strong asset growth may cause
deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the
medium term.
Looking at other revenue on slide 7, excluding the impacts of equity investments detailed earlier, non-interest
income increased $105 million or 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which
was up $51 million or 15%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards.
Sales were up 18% year-over-year, with growth across most categories. For the first half of the year, our sales
growth was 20%. We estimate that inflation contributed between 200 and 300 basis points to this figure. Strong
sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. Our rewards rate increased 6 basis points
year-over-year, reflecting two factors: our standard 5% category, aligning with customer needs, included gas this
quarter.
Second, the substantial growth in new accounts over the past year increased the cost of our Cashback Match.
However, on a sequential basis, the reward rate was up 1 basis point and up 3 basis points through the first half
of the year. This is consistent with our expectations of 2 to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost increases. Loan
fee income was up $37 million or 35%, primarily driven by an increase in late-fee instances.
Moving to expenses on slide 8, total operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 8% from the prior
quarter. Compensation costs were up slightly year-over-year, primarily due to increased head count and higher
average salaries. Like many organizations, we are seeing salary and wage pressure, which will likely continue
through the balance of this year and into next year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Marketing expenses increased $79 million or 45%, as we continue to invest for growth in our Card and Consumer
Banking products. We grew new card accounts by 39% from last year's second quarter. This speaks to the
strength of our brand, the relevance of our value proposition and the benefit of our investments in targeting
analytics.
As Roger discussed, we closely track economic and competitive conditions, and we remain disciplined about our
through-the-cycle approach to underwriting. This approach contributes to our confidence about investing in brand
and acquisition.
Moving to credit performance on slide 9, net charge-offs remained low and were in line with expectations for
continued credit normalization. Total net charge-offs were 1.8%, 32 basis points lower than the prior year, and up
19 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were down $27 million from the prior year, and
up $61 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points sequentially or
$50 million.
Looking at our receivables, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress at this point. Our delinquencies
are virtually unchanged from the first quarter. And while we expect some increases in delinquencies over the back
half, this is consistent with our outlook for steady credit normalization into 2023.
Turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide 10. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $110
million, largely due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate continued to decline, however, dropping 31
basis points to 6.8%. As a reminder, our reserves are based on our expectation of life of loan losses. On the
macroeconomic view, we believe the balance of risk has shifted to include the potential for an economic
slowdown resulting from Fed policy actions.
For us, the most significant driver of losses is changes to employment conditions. As Roger mentioned, the
current labor market conditions remain healthy. As examples, the number of job openings still exceeds the
number of unemployed people, and the unemployment rate remains low, but unemployment claims have started
to creep up. As part of our reserving process, we consider the prospects of higher unemployment and a range of
macroeconomic scenarios.
Looking at slide 11, our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 14.2%, well above our 10.5% target. The
strength of our capital position is underscored by the recent CCAR's regulatory stress test. Based on the CCAR's
results, our preliminary stress capital buffer should decrease by 110 basis points, which effectively lowers our
minimum required CET1 ratio to 7%, the lowest possible ratio. We repurchased $601 million of common stock
during the quarter and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share.
Concluding on slide 12, as we look into the back half of this year, our perspectives for 2022 remains favorable.
We are improving some elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to low-teens.
Continued strong sales and new account acquisitions through the second quarter support our confidence in this
outlook.
There's no change to our view on NIM. We continue to see 5 basis points to 15 basis points of upside for the full
year relative to the first quarter level of 10.85%. Our expectations for expenses remain at mid-single digit growth
versus last year. We still expect marketing cost to come in above 2019 levels, with non-marketing expenses to
increase by low-single digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We now expect net charge-offs to be between
1.9% and 2.1% for the full year, and we intend to return to share purchases at an appropriate time in the future.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisition. Credit
performance remained solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. We
managed operating expenses while investing in new account acquisition, brand and digital capabilities, and our
balance sheet and capital position are strong.
The results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model, and I'm confident
that we are well-positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the lines for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with
Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Really thanks, and really strong results in terms of account and loan growth. Maybe, Roger, could you just talk a
little more detail about kind of as you see the competitive environment – you're adding a lot of accounts, I know
you've talked about how you kind of originate them with a through-the-cycle approach. But just talk a little bit
about both how you see the competitive environment and how you see what you're – any kind of tweaks you are
making because of the current environment and talk about that in terms of the outlook. Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure, Moshe. Thanks for the question. I would say the competitive environment remains intense. With the
consumer staying strong, we are seeing strong levels of marketing from most of our prime competitors, but I think
our differentiated value proposition is succeeding well in the marketplace across all of our products.
From a credit standpoint, I would say we're roughly back to where we were pre-pandemic, but keep in mind, that's
sort of a late-cycle approach that we had towards the end of 2019. So, we think we remain conservative on credit,
but the differentiation from the brand and the product are really working well to drive growth, even in this
competitive environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on the student loan side, given that this is the key quarter coming up in
terms of originations, last quarter you talked a little bit about how you expected to have some advantages versus
market-funded players. Obviously, there's – you've got the issue that you've got from a compliance standpoint.
Can you talk about how that could impact you from an origination standpoint, and if that does, how long that could
last?

Yeah. We are moving forward with our plans for peak season. Again, what has been a wild card over the last
couple of years has been sort of overall number of kids going back to school and their demands for funding. So, I
think that – the market size is always a bit uncertain, but we feel good about how prepared we are as we move
into the peak origination months.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. You guys certainly have a -historically remained profitable through
the cycle with risk-adjusted yields remaining quite strong. You've been in a deep recession like we saw in 2008,
and it makes sense that you're continuing to invest here against the backup that we're in. But could you maybe
frame for us what it would take to curb your appetite for investing for growth, and maybe just what it would take for
you to have a pullback?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, there are a whole series of things we carefully monitor in terms of the health of
our customers and portfolio. And that goes into our appetite for growth. I would say, part of the things we watch
most carefully externally are the job market and rising unemployment.
And so, we have a finely-tuned playbook in terms of how we'll adjust originations, but we continue to originate
throughout the cycle. And so, even during the financial crisis you referred to, we kept up a certain level of account
production even as we became more conservative in credit. And our underwriting always uses a through-the-
cycle approach as we think about the profitability of accounts we're booking. So, those are some of the things we
look to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. And if I may follow up on that, maybe could you also frame how you're thinking about the risk that –
the strength that we're seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary, and could leave
the Fed to have to do more, and since we know that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, the
increases in unemployment that follow those Fed hikes tend to be quite lagged, and so those effects could take
some time to show up?
Maybe could you just speak to that dynamic, how that feeds if that feeds in any way into your reserving models?
We haven't had a significant inflation cycle in a long time. And so, there are some concerns that current
underwriting models may not be picking that up. Would love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Yeah. Hey, Bill, I'll take that one. Good question. We spent plenty of time thinking about it. So, inflation unto itself
is not correlated to loan losses based on all the historical data we've looked at. Now, certainly, we've seen some
changes in consumer behavior, so we'll keep an eye on it. But typically, it would be unemployment – or changes
in employment levels overall.
I have a particular view that as we try or the Fed tries to deal with the inflation situation, certainly, it's going to be
quite a period of time before the job market is directly impacted in a significant way. So, unemployment remains
super-low, so 3.5%. There's still about 11.3 million job openings right now versus 6 million people looking for jobs.
Spending remains robust and credit is performing very, very well. So, as we look at those factors, we're going to
keep an eye and see if there's any material changes on that. But in terms of reserving at this point, that life of loan
approach that we take, looking at broad macros as well as portfolio performance gave us confidence in the
reserving levels we chose and the corresponding reduction in the reserve rate. So, we'll keep an eye on it and
update it quarterly.

That's very helpful. Thank you, Roger and John. Appreciate it.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is on the share repurchase suspension. Obviously, that decision
was probably not something that was taken lightly. Could you just talk about the thought process in making that
decision given all the positive news on your excess capital and stress capital buffers and such? I mean, should
we infer that the size and scope of damages could be pretty significant?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks for the question, Sanjay. I think I tried to address that when I said our expense guidance that John
reaffirmed includes our views on this matter. So, there are many factors that go into a share repurchase program.
It's not just potential financial exposure. And I would say, returning our shareholders' capital in the form of the
repurchase has been a big focus for management and the board and will continue to do, and that's why John
said, we hope to get back to the repurchase program as soon as we are able.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess a question for John just on NIM. Obviously, I think, like, the Fed's posture has moved
towards more rate hikes. I'm just curious, your NIM expectation is sort of unchanged. But maybe you could just
talk about what went into that and if you're seeing any changes in deposit betas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So, the NIM guidance gave a range of benchmarking off the 10.85%, and we said 5 basis
points to 15 basis points range of upside from that. Based on the Fed actions to-date, we're tracking towards the
upper end of that guidance range at this point. So, that's a positive.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
We are seeing deposit cost increase, and that's a function of two things: The competitive environment and then
also the fact that we had a record loan growth in the quarter at 13%. So, the funding mix, as I said in my prepared
remarks, that will likely change in the back half of the year, and we're going to continue to focus on that 70%,
80%.
So, competitively, we're not going to lead certainly in terms of deposit pricing, but we're going to respond to
ensure we remain very competitive and have a proposition – a strong value proposition for our customers. So,
how that translates into betas? It's hard to call right now. But I would say, the first part of the year, we had a very,
very low beta. I would expect that to normalize as the funding environment migrates.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When we look back at some of the changes over the years,
like the promulgation of the CARD Act, there were impacts that people thought would be cyclical that became
secular in terms of loss rates, in terms of yields. I'm wondering, when we look at payment rates today, if there's
something that you guys might see that suggest that this is more of a secular change than a cyclical change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Rick. So, yeah, it's hard to call right now, but we do have some preliminary data that shows that
the decrease in the use of cash and the touchless transactions you may do at Starbucks or other institutions
where folks previously would use cash, a lot of that's gone away. So, it's creating a higher level of transactions
through our card. Good thing for us from an interchange perspective. But also, that cash that folks use to expend,
I believe there's some portion of it [ph] that is (00:29:07) now going to pay down balances, which is increasing the
payment rate.
Now, how much is that? It's hard to call right now. We're about 500 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic
level. If I were asked do we give a range? I would say, maybe 100 to 200 basis points of that could be a
permanent change, and then the rest has to do with the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the
consumers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Got it. Yeah, it's helpful. And I agree with that conclusion, it just feels like on a day-to-day basis, we're all using
less cash and I'm wondering if that's just driving more and more – creating more and more transactors for you
guys.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, John, maybe a question on the allowance. If I look, I recognize that, obviously, this is a life-of-loan count, but
when I look at the level of reserve today, you're only modestly below where you were at March of 2020, call it,
low-7s versus high-6s. So, could you maybe just give us a little more color in terms of what's assumed in the
reserve in terms of scenarios? And if we see a modest downturn just given how healthier consumers are, like
what could that do to both losses and the allowance over time? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So, as I mentioned in my previous comments, we looked at a number of different scenarios, but I can give
you a couple of data points here. In terms of unemployment, it ranged from a low of 3.3% at the end of 2022, to
peak of 5.8%. And then as we look at 2023, 3.5% to just about 5.5%. We're seeing a level of GDP growth slowing.
We haven't baked in a full recession, but certainly, GDP does reduce and is near zero in one of the scenarios we
ran.
The employment situation still is robust. And we certainly considered that as well. So, as we look out into 2023,
we're going to evaluate what the macro conditions are and the impact on life-of-loan losses. But for me, the
portfolio performance really, really strong; the job market really, really strong; uncertainty on the broad macros
and we conservatively model those. So, overall, I feel like we're 100% consistent with how we've reserved in the
past. We've taken that through-the-cycle underwriting approach. That has benefits through into the portfolio and
we've been conservative in our process to ensure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP.

Got it. And maybe, Roger, maybe a follow-up to Sanjay's question. I guess given that it doesn't sound like you're
expecting much in terms of cost from this investigation, I guess, maybe just talk about [audio gap] (00:33:04)
spend the buyback. And I know that you're limited in what you could say, but any sense for the timing of how long
an investigation like this could take? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. No, I am, to your point, limited in what I can say. We can't really give you anything to expect in timing other
than, you know our views on capital, and so as soon as we can, we hope to restart the buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Just one more question on the buyback. When you are able to resume, should we expect the
cadence to kind of mirror what you did in the first half this year, or could you accelerate repurchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
We'll look at that, Mark. Certainly, we have that broad authorization from the board for over five quarters. It's $4.2
billion to $4.3 billion of repurchases. So, depending on the pause, we'll see what we can do because certainly
we're over regulatory minimums, we're certainly over our internal target. And as we said previously, we're
committed to stepping the CET1 ratio down to 10.5%. So, we'll do what we can do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, great. And then maybe a question for Roger. I mean, just given kind of the pullback we've seen in fintech
valuations, is there anything that looks interesting here to deploy that capital inorganically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Good question. I think, while valuations have pulled back, I'm not sure there are any bargains yet. But for us,
we've tended not to focus on partnerships and potential investments as opposed to acquisitions. And a lot of
capabilities, given our great technology team, we feel like we can build ourselves. So, yeah, we have a good
business development effort that's always out there, but I wouldn't necessarily expect something.

Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just, sorry, back to the student loan issue. Just I know you've given all that you can comment on, but there's also
– in the public, we know that there's also a consent order related to this with the CFPB, it looks like 2020, and I
believe it's even tied to a consent order from 2015. But did that impact – did that influence the suspension, and
was there something new that developed that caused the internal investigation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I guess the only thing I can say is, both the consent order and the investigation are in the area of student loan
servicing, but beyond that, there really isn't anything else I can add at this time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks for helping there. And then separately, just on the – this is sort of related to it,
but more around the expenses. I know you indicated that the investigation is already contemplated into the
expense guide, and I appreciate that color. Does that mean that there were potential expense offsets that would
help keep the expense guide unchanged, or that – getting back to your earlier comment that there is unlikely to be
an expense impact?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, John, the way I would think about it is we're continuing to kind of run and manage our business and try
to be disciplined in the way we distribute expense dollars and spend expense dollars. Certainly, there's puts and
takes in every single expense line, and we've continued to have our foot on the gas in terms of new account
acquisition and media, which contributed to the marketing increases. The rest of it is – we consider it as part of
the cost of our operation, and we're trying to make it as efficient as we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks for that. If I could just ask one more on the credit side, I know that delinquencies edged up a little
bit year-over-year for 2Q. Did you see any pressure incrementally in the lower FICO bands, or any color around
the modest increase in delinquencies that you saw?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, what we're seeing is the lower FICO bands normalizing. And you would expect those to normalize more
quickly than the higher FICO bands and, frankly, we consider that when we do our underwriting. Interestingly,
what we've seen is early-stage delinquencies across the board have corrected in later-stage buckets more quickly
than we've seen in the past, and some of that could be our – some of the work we've done in terms of analytics
and optimized time to contact and collection strategy, that some of it could be just customer performance. So,
there's really no takeaways from the portfolio other than it continues to perform very, very well and gave us a
degree of comfort as we reduced the overall reserve rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Morning, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just on the investigation, one for me here. You did mention that it is embedded in your full year guide on
expenses, and I'm wondering if we should take that to mean that you expect the review will be finalized by the end
of this year. Is that a fair conclusion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
I wouldn't necessarily link those two. I think what we can say is that we did not see anything that would change
our view that non-marketing expenses this year would grow in the low-single digits. And we did indicate that we
would hope to have it concluded, but it's done by an independent committee that reports to the board.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And the buyback restarting is a function of the investigation concluding, is that fair, rather than like a
particular CET1 level?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Yeah. The termination of the buyback has nothing to do with our capital levels. It does not necessarily require the
investigation to be fully complete for us to resume. There are many complex factors that go into it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, it's a bit open-ended on our end thinking about when to put it back in the model. I realize you
understand that. So I suppose there will be a wide range of opinions after this call on that.
Just on the business, can we talk a little bit about the interchange rate? The gross interchange rate has been
really strong in recent quarters and wondering if there's anything in particular driving that. Are there increases in
competitors that you're matching or is there something else going on? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. The overall interchange has largely been a function of the robust sales volumes. So, we're up – our sales
were up 20% through the first half of the year, 18% through the end of the second quarter. So, that's driving
overall interchange. Now, mix does come into play in terms of the interchange rate, and obviously, we don't spend
a lot of time discussing that. But overall, the solid business performance is driving interchange.
And then, maybe your follow-on might be rewards. We did see a spike in rewards which to me wasn't a bad thing
whatsoever. What happened was, gas was one of the 5% categories in the quarter. Everybody knows about the
inflation at the pump. So, we had a larger percentage of customers maxing out on that 5% category, which drove
the rate up. But overall, the rate is – we expect 2 basis points to 4 basis points of inflation there. So, interchange,
in the aggregate, super strong. Interchange rate, very, very solid. Rewards, coming in at expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah, and that was the follow-up, so appreciate it. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. John, you mentioned I think sales growth was up
18% through the end of second quarter. I wanted to see if that was sort of holding through the first three weeks of
the third quarter. And then, are there any specific verticals you'd call out in terms of sales volume?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, it is holding. So, through Monday, we saw 17%. So, again, incredibly robust. Those figures actually
have surprised me a little bit to the upside which is nice. We're seeing travel increase. Obviously, we're seeing
petroleum increase. And the everyday categories have increased. The one thing that we did see through the first
half is – home improvement spend actually decreased versus everyday spend. So, it's still positive year-over-
year, but not increasing at the same rate as everyday spend and other retail.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess secondly, are you guys sort of seeing any change in consumer
behavior in regards to the inflationary environment in terms of sort of any substitution effects or anything that –
any color there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. We're seeing a little bit of it. We believe that in terms of gas that there's – certainly, it's significantly up year-
over-year, but call it the volume of transactions indicate a certain level of substitution or decrease in consumption
levels.
And then across the other categories, nothing discernible at this point, but we do – we do expect in the second
half of this year, with a high rate of inflation, that consumers are going to make some choices, and substitutions or
decrease in consumptions will likely happen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Meng Jiao Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one last follow-up on the student loan side, you had – your charge-
offs ticked off, although they're fairly low still on student loans, but it is still higher than what we've seen from a
quarterly run rate basis for the last few years. Is there anything related there to the investigation on why the
charge-offs may have ticked higher just in this particular quarter given credit metrics have been extraordinarily
good within that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. No, those aren't linked. And actually, I would view it as sort of a one-time move, and we feel very good
about the credit in our student loan portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then in regards to the outlook for NIM, appreciate everything for this year. But as you look out further
out, just given the yield curve today, would you expect some reversion back to your longer-term NIM down to the
low-10%, just given deposit costs are likely to remain fairly elevated as we go into next year, or maybe even
continue to move higher, just given the short end of the curve moving higher combined with maybe a flattening on
the long end? Is there anything you're seeing there that would cause NIM to maybe start to soften as we move
into the beginning of next year?

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Good question. So, I would say this. So, my expectations is that NIM will peak this year. And there are a
number of factors impacting it. Certainly, you mentioned deposit costs. That's going to kind of create some
impact. We're going to have impacts on credit which will impact it. But fundamentally, our funding mix has
changed, which I believe will drive improved net interest margin versus historical levels.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Well, maybe I'll start with just on the [ph] we'll call it (00:48:00)
competitive intensity a little bit. You're staying quite disciplined on rewards and operating costs even as you drive
growth. Could you talk a little bit about where your account growth is coming from? And the reason I ask is we've
seen a few aggressive offers around cashback introduced in recent months. That's historically been your
bailiwick. So, I was curious if you are seeing any kind of impact from some of those offers out in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. There are different competitors who'll do different offers. We tend to try and be more consistent and
sustainable. So, we like the – the Double Cashback for the first year has worked very well for us. So, yeah,
someone will be $300, $500, you'll see different issuers doing very long-term balance transfers. We just don't
think that's really driving sustainable growth. And a lot of that promotional activity can drive sort of new accounts,
but not necessarily long-term relationships. So, we like our long-term focus and approach, and it has served us
well in a variety of competitive environments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Okay. Thank you. And then – sorry, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but one last – from me just one
question on the buyback suspension. Is that something that regulators require or encourage you to do while you
get your arms around the servicing issues, or was the decision to suspend buybacks just solely driven by you
internally and DFS and the board?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. The decision was made by Discover.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I was wondering, how do you monitor want-versus-needs-
based loan growth as the consumer might feel some pressure both on an individual and a portfolio level. How do
you monitor that? Is there some internal data that perhaps we don't have access to that help you understand good
borrowing behavior versus bad borrowing behavior outside of delinquency trends? Thanks. And I just have a
follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I mean, it's a bit of a different answer for the portfolio, but for new accounts. But I would say, for our new
accounts, virtually all of it is want-based, right? We're not accepting anyone who doesn't have significant
availability on other credit cards outside of potentially our secured card where some of those people, we represent
their first card. So, it really is about want and having a better value proposition than they are seeing with their
other cards.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then I was just curious, how long out does your through-the-cycle loss
expectation look out for changes in economic overlays. So, does it include today, let's say, through the fourth
quarter of 2023?
Given our analysis, we see that that's the rough timing where some of these macro dominos might fall into place
with possibly higher unemployment-related net charge-offs. So, how does the [ph] waiting (00:51:23) work and the
– from a timing perspective of when you think an event may actually begin to occur and affect either your growth
algorithm or your loss algorithm? Anything you can provide on that would be really great. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I would say, we tend to look out roughly four to five years. But it is not as sensitive in terms of whether it's in
18 months or 2 years or 2.5 years. If you think about, this is a long-term product, and the cash flow is associated
with the credit card. And if you're not careful, you can find yourself whipping around your new account criteria
every week based on sort of the latest change in economic forecast. So, while we can react quickly, if it's far
enough out, you're not going to see sort of continuous adjustment for that. And then for the portfolio, it's much
more driven by account-level dynamics. We're really looking at the risk of individual accounts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Really solid fundamental results. Great to see. Just the network,
leveraging the network partnerships, and I know you have the areeba, Sezzle but just having this global payments
network, and just any update you can on your efforts to leverage that network. I know areeba, B2B payments, is
there anything else on the table there? I mean, that continues to grow nicely. But just any thoughts there that
make the network payments portion of the business a larger part of the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great question. So, I did talk about one of our latest network to network deals. So, we continue to invest
and expand acceptance. And some of those deals do also generate volume and more cross-border volume for us.
We remain in a wide range of discussions with different fintech players truly around the world, but we tend not to
comment on deals.
I would point out too though, we see a lot of value from the network, not just in the Payment Services segment,
but for the differentiation and capabilities it gives our card issuing business, and in particular, the support it
provides for rewards on debit, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. My follow-up was, I guess, rewards on debit because it seems like a pretty good opportunity for
Discover. Any updated information you could give us on Cashback Debit and the importance to your business
over the next five years, or potential benefits from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I think long term it will be really exciting and a great benefit for the business and provide another entry point
into the franchise versus most of our customers now coming from the credit card.
We continue to be deliberate in terms of how we grow that. We want to make sure that we're really solid
operationally, that we have the right fraud prevention in place, but it's a business we're going to scale for the long
term, and again, really excited about some of the early signs we're seeing in terms of cost per account and the
usage from some of the customers we're putting on.

post-pandemic from a depth and pricing and leverage perspective? And also, the same question in terms of
brokered CDs and...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great question. So, I'm going to kind of break it into kind of two categories. So, very pleased with the
team's execution when we go into the ABS market. I feel like the offerings are solid and the execution has been
very, very good. The other side of the coin is, when we were in that low-rate environment, the all-in rates on some
of those transactions were unbelievable. We were down at 71 basis points. So, it took me personally a little bit to
come to terms with something in the 2s or 3s right now. But that's a function of where we are and relative to what
we're driving in terms of top line yield, it's still superefficient, secured and an important funding source.
The rest of the funding stack continues to be stable. The broker CDs that you mentioned, they're pricing higher
than our online deposits, and we're trying to get the right balance in terms of ensuring we're competitive, that
we're not a market leader in terms of deposit pricing decisions, but also not having to kind of lean into more
expensive funding sources. But we'll continue to evolve there and make sure we're making good efficient choices
for the franchise.

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. The stronger loan growth that you've seen recently and increase in your guidance for the full year, how
much of normalizing of payment rates is included in that versus just the continued momentum that you're having
acquiring new accounts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Arren, thanks for the question. Very little. So, we modeled out a sustained high payment rate normalization
back in through 2023. And frankly, if the payment rate should reduce, that would provide some more energy for
growth. We haven't anticipated that. The drivers of growth have been kind of the strong sales performance, the
new accounts that we've put on the books in the later part of 2020 and into 2021 and into this year, and
customers putting our card top of wallet. So, we've been really pleased and feel like the balance of kind of risk
versus opportunity in terms of additional growth is probably more on the opportunity side at this point.

independent from the board. But I can't comment on our discussions with regulators.
