MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name

Executive Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. John Turner will provide
highlights of our financial performance, then David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter.
Earnings-related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations
section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the
Q&A segment of today's call.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John.

John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and thank you all for joining our call day. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our
fourth quarter and full year results. This morning, we reported strong full year earnings from continuing operations
of $1.5 billion, resulting in a 10% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. This year, we also
delivered the highest level of pre-tax pre-provision income in over a decade, while generating 4% positive
operating leverage on a reported basis and 2% on an adjusted basis.
Despite lower interest rates and significant market volatility, 2019 was a solid year, and I'm proud of all that we
accomplished. We continue to make progress on our goal of generating consistent, sustainable, long-term
performance through all phases of the economic cycle. Although, market uncertainty continues, the economy is
still growing. Our customers are optimistic about their businesses and consumer confidence remains healthy.
We're also encouraged by progress made on the trade front. However, we'll continue to monitor geopolitical
tensions and the uncertainties they introduce. As we begin the new year, we have solid momentum and feel good
about how we're positioned.
We have a comprehensive hedging strategy in place to protect net interest income, so we don't have to stretch for
loan growth. Our core businesses continue to produce good results, generating growth in consumer checking
accounts and households, credit cards and wealth assets under management. We're very pleased with the
performance of our priority markets and investments in our businesses continue to pay off. We have a robust
credit risk management framework, and while asset quality continues to normalize, overall, it remains pretty
benign.
And finally, although we've made significant progress to simplifying growth, we're only one-third complete with our
current list of identified initiatives. There are a lot of process improvements and of revenue generating

opportunities left. We continue to leverage digital across our omni-channel platform to better meet customer
needs and improve efficiency and effectiveness.
A few quick examples. Four-year checking account and credit card production increased 17% and 65%,
respectively. Loan applications increased 54% and in mortgage approximately 60% of all applications are
completed online. Mobile deposits increased 52% and now represent 13% of all deposits.
As we look forward, we're focused on the things we can control, meeting the needs of our customers with best-in-
class service while leveraging technology and making banking easier for our associates and customers. We will
continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business, generating positive operating leverage through disciplined
expense management and prudent investment decisions. Our priorities center on soundness, profitability, and
growth in that order.
Thank you for your time and attention this morning. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to thank the 19,000
plus associates here at Regions for their commitment and dedication throughout 2019. Because of this team, I'm
confident about 2020 and feel good about our plans which support delivering consistent sustainable results
through all phases of the economic cycle. David?

David J. Turner, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average total loans decreased less than 1%, while
ending total loans increased modestly. Adjusted average consumer loans increased 1%, led by increases in
indirect-other, credit card, and mortgage, partially offset by declines in home equity. Average business loans
decreased 1% and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability,
as well as lower line utilization and elevated pay down activity during the quarter.
We continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short-
term benefit. That said, we expect full year 2020 average loan balances to remain relatively stable on a reported
basis and to grow in the low single-digits on an adjusted basis. Similar to 2019, we expect 2020 loan growth to be
led by business services lending, specifically C&I loans with modest growth in owner-occupied commercial real
estate and investor real estate. Within consumer lending, we expect growth in residential mortgage, indirect-other,
card, and direct lending.
Turning to average deposits, reflecting seasonal trends average corporate segment deposits increased 4%,
average wealth segment deposits increased 1%, while average consumer segment deposits remained relatively
stable. Of note, total non-interest-bearing deposits grew 1.5% during the quarter. Deposit growth in the business
segments was partially offset by a 51% decline in other segment deposits due primarily to reductions within
wholesale corporate treasury deposit categories reflective of a lower need for wholesale borrowings.
So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Net interest income declined 2% linked quarter
and net interest margin declined 5 basis points to 3.39%. Net interest margin and net interest income were
negatively impacted by lower market interest rates. However, this was partially offset by declining deposit cost
and a more favorable funding mix. Lower loan balances reduced net interest income but benefited net interest
margin.
With respect to funding, we completed the cash tender offer during the quarter for approximately two-thirds of our
outstanding 3.2% parent company senior notes, incurring $16 million in extinguishment costs. The estimated run
rate benefit in 2020 is an increase to annual net interest income of approximately $15 million and a 1 to 2-basis

point improvement in margin. As expected, total deposit cost declined 8 basis points compared to the prior quarter
to 41 basis points and interest-bearing deposit cost declined 13 basis points to 64 basis points. The associated
deposit beta was 28% this quarter. Regions continues to deliver industry-leading performance in the space,
exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. Assuming a stable rate environment, we expect modest
reductions in deposit cost moving forward.
Now that the majority of our forward-starting hedges have begun, our balance sheet is largely insulated from
movement in short-term rates and additional hedging and securities repositioning have reduced roughly half of
our sensitivity to longer-term rates. $4.5 billion of forward-starting hedges were added during the quarter, aimed at
locking in a portion of 2020 fixed rate originations. Looking ahead, during the first quarter, we expect the margins
to expand in the low-3.40s as the benefits of our hedging strategy begin.
Now, let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1% compared to the
third quarter led by growth in capital markets, wealth management, and service charges. Capital markets
experienced a record quarter driven by growth across most categories, notably, M&A advisory, loan syndications,
and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. Commercial swap
income also benefited from favorable CVA adjustments during the quarter. Although mortgage income decreased
compared to the prior quarter, results remained strong despite seasonally lower production, as well as less
favorable hedging and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. For the full year, mortgage was a
significant contributor to non-interest income growth, increasing 19%. Other non-interest income declined this
quarter, driven primarily by positive valuation adjustments to certain equity investments in the prior quarter that
did not repeat at the same level.
Let's move on to the non-interest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses remain well-controlled, increasing
slightly compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits, marketing and professional
fees. Salaries and benefits increased modestly driven by higher production-based incentives. The increase in
marketing expense was driven primarily by additional campaigns targeting priority markets, while professional
fees reflected the timing of legal and consulting cost.
The company's fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.1%, and the effective tax rate was 20.3%. As John
mentioned, we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process, as we were only one-third complete
with our current list of identified initiatives, several of which are exceeding our initial expectations. For example, at
Investor Day, we committed to reducing our total square footage by 2.1 million square feet and our third-party
spend by $60 million to $65 million by 2021. We also disclosed plans to consolidate 100 branches during that
same period.
Based on the progress we made in 2019, we're on track to exceed our targets related to square footage and third-
party spend reductions as well as branch consolidations. We're now targeting third-party spend reductions in the
$80 million to $85 million range, and we will continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on
initiatives where we can.
For 2020, we recognize revenue growth will be challenging. However, we remain committed to achieving full year
adjusted positive operating leverage. While our hedging strategy helps mitigate the risk from lower rates, full year
growth and net interest income will be difficult. We have good momentum and growing non-interest revenue
which we expect to continue. So while total revenue growth may be modest, we will continue to lean into
expenses and the opportunities identified through simplifying growth, all the while continuing to make prudent
investments to drive revenue growth.

We will again spend approximately $625 million on technology in 2020. We expect to open approximately 20 new
branches and we will continue to hire talented bankers across our businesses. With respect to the effective tax
rate, we expect the full year 2020 range to be 20% to 22%.
So let's shift to asset quality. Overall credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter.
We saw improvement in several categories, while experiencing some normalization than others. Net charge-offs
were 46 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, in line with our expected range of 40 to 50
basis points for 2019.
Provision equaled net charge-offs, resulting in an allowance equal to 1.05% of total loans and 171% of total non-
accrual loans. Non-performing loans increased 10%, primarily attributable to a single credit within the waste
management industry, which we expect will be resolved over the next several quarters. Delinquencies and
troubled debt restructured loans remained stable quarter-over-quarter, while business services criticized loans
decreased 3%. For 2020, we expect full year net charge-offs between 45 and 55 basis points.
Let me comment briefly on CECL. We continue to finalize our day one impact assumptions and expect the impact
to be in the $500 million to $530 million range. So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the
company repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $132 million and declared $149 million in common
dividends. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 9.6% in line with our target level of 9.5%. The loan
deposit ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 85%.
The next slide reflects 2019 performance against our targets, and we've also provided you with a summary of full
year 2020 expectations. Wrapping things up, in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop, we are
pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial results. We have a solid strategic plan designed to deliver
consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle.
With that, we're happy to take your questions but do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for more
callers. We will open the line for your questions.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from
Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So we hear you loud and clear and I think your investors appreciate your continued discipline in loan underwriting.
I think you alluded to in previous calls, potential wholesale consumer strategies to offset some of the GreenSky
runoff. And I know you listed the categories, David, during your prepared remarks, but maybe dive a little bit into
detail about some of the consumer strategy. And could there be a potential wholesale strategy, and again, I'm not
asking if you're buying a depository in terms of obtaining portfolios or accelerating partnerships to deploy your
loan-to-deposit ratio of 85%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Erika, good morning. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, the growth will – we should
experience actually will be more on the business services side. On the consumer side, we're going to continue to
have our runoff of our indirect auto portfolio that will put pressure on total balances. We have made some shift in
terms of our indirect-other consumer. You saw that in the fourth quarter. That'll continue somewhat in the first part
of the year, then we kind of get to our concentration limit after first quarter or so. So you shouldn't see that
continue to grow at the same pace that you saw in the fourth quarter throughout the year. We are going to
continue to grow residential mortgage but we are going to continue to grow our credit card books as well. Those
will be the big drivers of consumer, but net-net, total consumer will be relatively stable if you carve out the runoff
portfolio. So the growth that we're trying to send the message really is going to come in the – primarily in the C&I
area.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
But Erika, I would say, we are actively observing what's going on in the market, looking for opportunities. We're
evaluating different opportunities that may come along. Clearly, we shifted our exposure from the GreenSky
relationship to increasing our exposure through SoFi that is largely a result of the fact that SoFi is originating
loans directly to consumers versus indirectly, which was the GreenSky model. We like that better. We're learning
more about SoFi and the portfolio that we have and I think you can expect us to continue to explore ways, other
ways to grow consumer loans over the next year.

Operator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning. You raised your net charge-off guidance slightly for 2020 versus 2019. Just wondering kind of
what's driving that? Is it more conservatism or are you seeing some underlying weakness in any certain
portfolios? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Jennifer this is David. So we had 40 to 50 basis points last year. We raised it slightly about 45 to 55 basis points,
acknowledging a couple different things. One, if you look at last couple of quarters, we were at 44 to 46. We also
see some normalization of credit especially on the consumer side. We also, as Erika just mentioned, some shift in
terms of consumer lending into other higher loss categories. We feel good about that because we're getting paid
for the risk that we take. But if you're just looking to get the charge-off number in isolation, it will be up perhaps
slightly. So we didn't think that. That's really not signaling any broad deterioration in credit, whatsoever.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you can follow up the CECL discussion and help us understand how
you're starting to think about the day two impacts especially given some of the moving parts of your ins and outs
on the consumer portfolio side and you're already high 1.7-ish looks like pro forma reserve-to-loans ratio. Do you
think you'll have to meaningfully build as you go forward and how do you start to help us understand that? Thank
you.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Yeah, I think the best way – so we need to see what everybody else comes up within CECL. Clearly, the type of
lending that you have, your portfolio makes a big difference. Consumer, long-dated assets, duration assets have
a much higher CECL reserve to that. As you think about CECL for day two, the first thing you ought to think about
is, was a charge-off expectations. And Jennifer just brought that up. From that, then you look at loan growth.
We've told you was on an absolute basis, our loans would be flat. On an adjusted basis, they would be up a bit,
so not a lot of change there.
Then you have to think through the mix, what are you growing versus what's running off. And so we'll give you
better clarity on that at a later date. So we don't see a big change in CECL this particular year because we don't
currently forecast a change in the economic outlook and that's something that all of us need to be aware of is
when you forecast the change in economic outlook, they can cause a little bit of volatility in provisioning. So those
are really the key pieces that I think you should consider as you try to model the provision for next year.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
You guys had a good year on the core fee income growth. It's up about 6%. Do you think mid-single-digit growth
is going to be sustainable in 2020? And just if you could talk about some of the businesses where you see some
of the better growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, so Peter, we were very pleased with our growth in the year for non-interest revenue in particular in the
fourth quarter. If you take our top three categories, those are really driven by continued growth in customers. So
growing customer checking accounts, growing operating accounts, growing customers from the wealth
standpoint, those are all critically important to us. We feel good about that. We've hired additional personnel
during 2019 that will help us continue to grow customer accounts.
As you look at mortgage, mortgage had a really good year this year. It'll be hard to repeat that for all of 2020 but
mortgage will be a big contributor to non-interest revenue and we feel good about where we are there. Capital
markets had a really strong fourth quarter. We've mentioned to you before that that business has been about a
$45 million to $55 million revenue per quarter business. We think that, that number is really in the kind of $50

million to $60 million business for us now. So we think relative to 2019, capital markets should have some nice
growth.
It got off to a pretty slow start in 2019. We think it's going to get off to a nice in 2020 based on the backlog of the
business that we see. So, when you add all that up, we have pretty good confidence that we're going to have nice
growth in non-interest revenue. And frankly, that is one of the key drivers of why we're committed to and believe
we will generate positive operating leverage in a challenging rate environment for 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. You guys have done also a good job on controlling the deposit costs with
higher rates and we've seen deposit costs coming down already with the cut in rates. I'm just wondering total
deposit costs of 41 basis points, is there much room left to lower deposit costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Our beta for this past quarter was about 28%. That's a little lower than our accumulative beta and our
accumulative beta is about 27% this down cycle. That's slightly below what we saw in the uprate cycle. And as a
result of that, we think there's – if we stay flat here, there's no movement which we don't expect much movement
from the Fed, we would continue to have deposit costs come down some more. It's probably not at the rate that
you've seen but I think there's incremental continued benefit there. And again that's part of our margin guidance
that we've given you too that we think the margin can expand along with the hedging program that we have, that
margin would expand a bit in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's great. Thanks, David.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, look, I know there's some kind of drag to loan growth in, call it, the near-term here and I think the derisking,
you guys have been very consistent and have been well received. I guess my question is like if we look kind of
more medium-term and think about the type of loan growth that you should have, the type of deposit growth that
you should have, considering the market, it's like what's reasonable levels, again, beyond 2020, just thinking. And
the reason I'm asking is I feel like the balance sheet growth has been less than most of us would expect given the
economies, given your market. But I'm also appreciative of the derisking and call it the focus on the profitability

which has helped the [ph] NIM free up the capital (00:26:17). But maybe talk about the medium-term outlook for
those two areas. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, so Matt, we have been extremely deliberate in allocating capital to those relationships that give us the
appropriate risk-adjusted return. Because at the end of the day, that's what we think really is what our investors
want us to do with a capital, not just to grow, but to grow appropriately, to grow with the right return. As just an
example, this year, we've recycled $2 billion worth of credit out of our core banking group that we could have add.
We could add an additional $2 billion for the loan growth. It would've been a suboptimal return. These are
customers that we seek to sell and offer more of our banking services, so we can have a full relationship with
great returns, and we can't get that. When it comes up for renewal, we let it go. And so we're going to stick to that.
Now that being said, as you think about loan growth for us in the short and long-term is we should be GDP plus a
little bit. Our expectation for GDP this coming year is slightly under 2%. As a matter of fact, it's 1.8% in our
estimate. So we have low single-digits of loan growth expectations on an adjusted basis for 2020. And it's
because if we try to push too hard past GDP, we think you make a bad credit decision. So we're going to be
credibly disciplined. We realize we need to grow. We're all about that, growing earnings, growing revenues and
return. And so it's all off the delicate balance and how we do that appropriately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just any guess on relative to kind of industry growth or kind of GDP growth, as you think about
medium-term kind of loan-to-deposit growth rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I'd say, Matt, we've said consistently that we, and David reiterated this, if we want to grow with the economy
plus a little, recognizing that while the markets we're in are good growth markets, they're also markets that
historically have demonstrated a fair amount of volatility. And so it's important to us that we stay disciplined, as
David said, focused on appropriate allocation of capital. And we think growing with the economy plus a little is the
right place for us, medium-term, longer-term.

Okay. Why don't we go to the next question? We lost Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Certainly, your next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, hello, good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Saul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. I guess a follow-up question on CECL. As Ken mentioned, your ACL ratio moves up with your with
your day one impact to over 1.7% which seems pretty high given the risk profile of your loan book and the
composition of your loan book. The only banks who – very few banks who have given day one impacts are above
that level unless they have a much more consumer oriented exposure. And I know a lot of things go into it. I know
you have more term loans in your C&I book for example. But I mean I guess how conservative do you think that
estimate is it and as I – if I look forward to the day two impact and you think about what you said, David, on mix, it
would seem – how do I think about the loss content of what's coming on your books versus what's getting paid off
because it would seem given your derisking that that 1.7% reserve ratio could trend lower going forward or is that
too aggressive of a comment or an expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, you asked few questions. Let me see if I can break it down. So the 1.70% relative to others, you really – the
mix is hugely important. I suspect when we get to providing more granular disclosures by loan type and break that
down so that you will have a better gauge as to what new production would cost and what benefit you might get
for runoff of our loan portfolio. So we don't – we tried to get this right. We've tightened up the range quite a bit
between $500 million and $530 million. That's again to our 1.1% reserve today which includes a reserve for
unfunded commitments to 1.70%. So I think what you're going to need some incremental disclosures to help you
on a go-forward basis. We'll be providing that to you in a later point. But we think the reserves that we have for
CECL is pretty appropriate and we didn't do anything to be overly conservative or otherwise. We just did what we
thought the standard called for and we're moving forward. We'll all learn a little bit from each other as we go
through the year and we'll be making decisions on how that might affect our business and production and pricing
going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I guess just following up like in terms of how should we be thinking about provisions going forward,
should we be thinking that a 1.7% lifetime ratio is sort of appropriate, we should be provisioning to maintain that
level of reserve ratio going forward?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think, for the time being, as I was trying to get to that point earlier is if you think about provisioning for
2020, the first thing you ought to think about is what's your charge-off expectation for us next year. Then what is
the loan growth, net loan growth expectation for us next year. We've given you guidance that says our net loans
will be flat – we'll grow on an adjusted basis, but we have a runoff of our vehicle portfolio that will be working
against balances there.
And then your third – and so the third component would be what are you growing, the mix makes a difference and
will give you some more granular data later to help you there. And then what's your expectation of the economic
outlook from quarter-to-quarter? And that could be – that could change. Now we think the economy is going to be
fairly stable this year. That's our going in thought but that can change. And so those are the roughly four pieces
that you need to have in terms of projecting CECL provisioning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. All right. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Regarding your expectation for positive operating leverage in 2020, can you help size up the magnitude or maybe
give us just a little bit more color around it regarding the components? And then also why not provide more
detailed outlook around 2020? You previously have given full year expense growth and full year revenue targets,
what's different about this year that you're not giving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, let's see if I can help you there. So let's take the big component, so NII which is two-thirds of our revenue
would be very hard to grow that this year with the low single-digit loan growth on an adjusted basis that we have
given you. And that's just the mere rate play the first half of 2019 rates being up off the December 2018 rate
increase would be hard to replicate. And then for the other third of our revenue, NIR, we've given you a little bit of
guidance in terms of what you can model. We feel good about that growth. From an expense standpoint, we said
we'd be relatively stable from an expense standpoint. And if you add all three of those up, we will generate
positive operating leverage. So I think we've been reasonably explicit in terms of what – how we'd get there. So
you can play with the numbers from that standpoint.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thanks, David. And then to confirm on what you just said, that relatively stable expectation for 2020
expenses, that already factors in your IT investments and what you're doing on the core systems front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Absolutely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I would underscore the point, John. That includes our continued investments in talent, in markets, and in
technology. We're not adjusting our budgets at all and we believe we can continue to deliver stable expenses
year-over-year.

Good morning, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. I'm going to ask the capital question. I know I always do on this call, but I did want to
understand how you're thinking about capital utilization, not only in your base case assumption where you've got
net loan growth flat in total, but in an environment where things, actually loan growth accelerates a little bit more,
maybe you should give us a sense as to, do we just hold with this what I would consider a little bit of excess
capital, or is the pipeline of bolt-ons robust enough to use some of this, or do we anticipate a little bit more
buyback this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, so it's always a good question on capital. Just to reiterate how we think about utilization of the capital we
generated. So first off, we're getting close to our target we laid out, 9.6% Common Equity Tier 1 today, estimated
on our current target of 9.5%. As we've mentioned before, that has 50 basis points of the management buffer. Our
quantitative calculations set would lead us to believe we need about 9% Common Equity Tier 1. As we think
about, first and foremost, our capital there for us to grow appropriately organically in particular, and so we have
low single-digit loan growth expectations and you can do some quick math and see we'll use a little bit of capital
from that standpoint.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
We've targeted the 35% to 45% of our earnings to go and be paid to our shareholders in the form of the dividend.
So you have that piece. We have from time to time done some bolt-on acquisitions. Those use capital.
[indiscernible] (00:37:53) but it's certainly something if we see opportunities, John just talked about, we look at
different things from time to time. And if we can deploy that capital in a meaningful manner that helps grow our
long-term business, we'll do so.
And then frankly, the last thing we do is share repurchases. We aren't crazy about doing share repurchases, but
we also don't want to continue to have excess capital. So, if we can't deploy it in a meaningful manner through
organic loan growth, bolt-on acquisitions, then we'll give that back to the shareholder in the form of share
repurchases like we've done this past several years. So I think those are the pieces that you need to have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Is there anything on the bolt-on front? I mean you've had a nice pace over the past year or so. And I know
you mentioned the fee outlook several times. So is the fee outlook with the current footprint that you have or does
the fee outlook – could the fee outlook be enhanced by incremental acquisitions, maybe you could speak a little
bit to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean we continue to look at opportunities whether it be investments in capital markets capabilities, wealth
management, buying more servicing rights, not a great time to do that today but we're still looking. There are
other capabilities, potentially that we have some interest in. We look at loan portfolios from time to time and those
are things that we'll continue to do as we think about how we invest in the excess capital we have in other parts of
our business that will help us grow over time.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Thank you. I apologize about that. Hi, guys. I apologize. Can you guys share with us, you've done a really good
job over the last three years or so on being very conservative in your underwriting standards and of course has
resulted in more modest loan growth in some of your peers and I'm not asking you to comment on your peers'
underwriting standards. But can you just give us some color in commercial C&I that is, in commercial real estate,

what kind of underwriting are you guys seeing that you're just not comfortable with that maybe some of your peers
are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
I've asked Ronnie Smith, who heads our Corporate Banking Group to respond, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald G. Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp.
Hey, Gerard, good morning. You know and you may have heard this earlier, but we are really focused back in on
the relationship side of things, Gerard, simply because we believe that when you have a broad and a deep
relationship, you become more meaningful to that client and it gives you the ability to weather through whatever
storms might be out there when you are meaningful to them, have the opportunity to get in early and really client
selectivity on the front side is so important but understanding the complete flow of business that they have, the
complete demand that they have with banking services is really where we try to be focused.
And I would also say that we look historically at how well companies have gone through the cycles, really strongly
lean into the management, their capability, how they performed through the last cycle, and then of course use the
standard underwritings that I won't go into the details around that today but those are the high level pieces of how
we try to look at the risk that we take on when we go through client selectivity.
The only thing I would add to that is that specifically to your question, I think the – what I most consistently hear
from our bankers is loan-to-value, so our willingness to provide as much capital as a customer may want tends to
be the differentiator. As an example, we may want to loan 60% loan-to-value on a project, then the customer can
get 65% or 70% from someone else. So that's a function of a variety of factors but that tends to be the most
significant differentiator in today's marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Gerard, this is Barb Godin. I would also add that we stay very, very close to our customers. Our people in the field
do an excellent job with that. And we are touching bases with them sometimes on a weekly basis but often
monthly, certainly quarterly, and making sure that if there's any early warning signs of any risks that are out there
that we're on top of it early. Because as you know if you can get on top of a problem early, you've got a lot more
solutions you can give than when you have to wait until there's nothing left to do but to exit the relationship.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then just as a follow-up question, obviously, you're one of the so-called extended cycle banks, so
you'll be going through a full CCAR this year. David, are you expecting any differences between this year and
what you did last year? Last year, obviously, you didn't go through it being an extended cycle bank. Should we
expect any kind of differences?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Gerard, we go through stress tests all the time internally. Yes, this is one that we have to fill out the form
and go through the review process with our regulatory supervisors. We are awaiting the instructions for that.
We're looking to see if there are any changes. There was an article I think this morning or yesterday, I can't

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
remember, in [ph] The Banker (00:43:34), regarding the expectations where some changes in CCAR for this year.
Things like, if you're in stress, do you have to continue with anticipated share repurchases at the same pace in a
stressed environment? I mean that's something we would not do. So we we're hoping that that gets changed in
the rules. Or would we continue to grow the portfolio at the same pace that we are now if we're in a stressed
environment. So those are two pretty big important things that we're hoping might get changed in the rules. But
other than that, understanding what losses are, I mean, if this is a good exercise for the industry for us individually
and for our regulatory supervisors, and so we're ready to go and we'll be submitting that plan in first part of April.
