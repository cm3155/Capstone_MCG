Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. I hope everybody is safe and well.
You've seen that amidst continued uncertainty on many fronts, PNC delivered solid third quarter results. We grew
revenue led by non-interest income which included a bounce back in consumer fees on higher volumes. We
managed expenses, which allowed us to generate positive operating leverage of over 4% in both the quarter and
year-to-date period. And our provision for credit losses was substantially less than last quarter.
On the flip side, net interest income fell from the second quarter, given the low interest rate environment and
weak loan demand. Despite growth in customers and commitments, our loans outstanding declined due to lower
utilization rates, including the payoff of commercial lines of credit that were drawn early in the pandemic. And
while we continue to experience strong deposit growth, the current environment has made it more challenging to
put those deposits to work. While the provision and charge-offs were down quarter-on-quarter, non-performers
continue to rise, especially in the high-impact COVID areas that Rob is going to discuss in a little bit more detail.
Notwithstanding these challenges, we feel that PNC is well positioned with very strong capital, liquidity and loan
loss reserves. Needless to say, there are several significant upcoming events, including the next round of stress
tests, the election and PPP forgiveness that may impact the industry and our borrowers, which underscores the
importance of our strong position. We're confident that the actions we've taken position us to both support our
clients and communities and take advantage of potential investment opportunities, if they arise, to enhance
shareholder value.
I want to thank our employees who despite the various challenges of the pandemic continue to execute on our
strategic priorities, including ongoing investments in our national expansion and digital offerings, all while helping
our customers navigate financial hardship and other challenges.
During the quarter, we opened retail solution centers in Nashville, Houston, Denver, Boston and Dallas and filled
out corporate teams in the recently opened Seattle and Portland markets. In 2021, we will continue our middle
market expansion into San Antonio, Austin and San Diego. The ability to expose our model to these
demographically attractive markets continues to generate strong returns.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results, and then we'll be happy
to take your questions.

Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.
As you've seen, we've reported third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.39 per diluted common share. Our
balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.
On the asset side, total loans declined $15 billion to $253 billion linked-quarter. Investment securities of $91 billion
increased $2 billion or 2% linked-quarter, but on a spot basis, declined $7 billion primarily due to significant
prepayment activity and maturities at quarter end. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $60 billion

compared with $34 billion in the second quarter. The increase was a result of continued deposit growth and the
full quarter impact of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $350 billion and were up $15 billion or 5% linked-quarter.
Borrowed funds decreased $10 billion compared to the second quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to
reduce borrowings primarily with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $95.71 per
common share as of September 30, an increase of 2% linked-quarter and 16% year-over-year.
As you can see on slide 5, our capital, reserve and liquidity positions remain strong. As of September 30, 2020,
our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 11.7%. Our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common
stock of $1.15 per share. And as you know, the Fed has authorized dividends for the fourth quarter, again, subject
to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters. On this basis, our fourth
quarter dividend is 26% of that rolling number. In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal
Reserve's directive, we'll continue to suspend repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020.
Our loan loss reserve levels are 2.58%, up slightly from 2.55% at the end of June. And our liquidity coverage
ratios continue to significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements, as we remain core funded with a
low-cost deposit base.
Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $253 billion in the third
quarter were down $15 billion or 6% compared to the second quarter. This decline reflected a $13.7 billion
decrease in commercial loan balances, as new loan production was more than offset by broad-based lower
utilization.
In our C&IB segment, virtually all of the drawdowns that occurred in the first quarter have since paid back and our
utilization rates are currently running approximately 1% below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans declined
approximately $1.3 billion across all categories, except for residential mortgage which increased. Compared to
the same period a year ago, average loans grew 6% or $15 billion.
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.32%, a 5 basis point decline in the second quarter. And the
rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits was 12 basis points, an 11 basis point decline linked-quarter. Average
deposit balances of $350 billion increased $15 billion or 5%. Commercial deposits grew, reflecting the enhanced
liquidity positions of our customers. And consumer deposits also grew, primarily due to government stimulus and
lower consumer spending. Year-over-year, deposits increased $71 billion or 26%.
As you can see on slide 7, third quarter total revenue was $4.3 billion, up $205 million linked-quarter or 5%. Net
interest income of $2.5 billion was down $43 million or 2% compared to the second quarter, as lower earning
asset yields and a decline in loan balances more than offset the benefit of lower funding costs and an extra day in
the quarter.
Our net interest margin decreased to 2.39%, down 13 basis points linked-quarter, reflecting the impact of higher
balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank which averaged $60 billion for the quarter. Fed cash balances in
excess of our LCR requirements were approximately $40 billion, which represented 25 basis points of
compression to our net interest margin.
Non-interest income of $1.8 billion increased $248 million or 16% linked-quarter. Fee revenue of $1.3 billion
increased $62 million or 5% compared to the second quarter. Asset management revenue increased $16 million
or 8%, primarily due to higher average equity markets.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Consumer services and service charges on deposits in total increased by $100 million due to higher consumer
activity and a decrease in fee waivers. Corporate services declined $33 million or 6%, as higher treasury
management product revenue was more than offset by lower advisory-related fees. Residential mortgage revenue
declined $21 million or 13%, driven by both lower servicing fees and lower loan sales revenue.
Other non-interest income of $457 million increased $186 million and included a positive valuation adjustment of
private equity investments compared with a negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter of a similar
magnitude. The positive valuation adjustment was partially offset by lower capital markets-related revenue.
Non-interest expense increased $16 million or less than 1% compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit
losses was $52 million, a decrease of $2.4 billion as a provision expense for our commercial portfolio was largely
offset by a provision recapture in our consumer portfolio.
And our effective tax rate was 9.8%. The lower rate was primarily related to increased tax credits during the
quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 13%.
Turning to slide 8. During the third quarter, we generated positive operating leverage of 4% (sic) [4.4%] in both
the year-over-year quarter and the year-to-date comparisons. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 59% in
the third quarter of 2020, compared to 62% for both the prior-year third quarter and the nine months ended
September 30, 2019.
While the current environment presents revenue challenges from low rates and pandemic-related pressures, we
remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. As we previously stated, we have a goal to
reduce costs by $300 million in 2020 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll
achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and
technology investments.
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of
the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of September 30 to these industries were $18.3 billion or $16.4
billion excluding PPP loans. These balances declined 7% compared to the second quarter primarily due to pay-
downs. While we still haven't experienced material charge-offs in these industries, we do expect to see charge-
offs increase over time, should current economic trends continue.
Commercial and industrial loan balances in this category totaled $10.5 billion on September 30, declining
approximately $1 billion or 9% compared to the prior quarter. Non-performing loans in these industries remain
relatively low at 1% of loans outstanding, but we're continuing to see downgrades with the greatest stress
continuing to be in leisure and recreation.
Looking at the lower half of this slide, commercial real estate loans in this category totaled $7.8 billion at the end
of the third quarter, declining $300 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter. Non-performing loans increased
approximately $180 million, and downgrades continue to occur primarily in retail and lodging. Correspondingly,
our reserves on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 2.17% from 1.33% in the second
quarter.
Moving to slide 10. We have seen a significant reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses
requesting hardship assistance. At the peak this summer, we had granted modifications to more than 300,000
consumer and small business accounts, representing approximately $13.7 billion of loans. $6.9 billion of these
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
loans were government guaranteed or investor owned, which present very little credit risk to PNC. Of the
remaining $6.8 billion of loans that did present credit risk, more than $5 billion have rolled off payment assistance,
and 92% of those accounts are current or less than 30 days past due.
As a result, we had $1.7 billion of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance as
of September 30. Of those balances, approximately 85% are secured and more than 60% of these accounts have
made a payment in their last cycle.
On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual
borrower's situation. Within our C&IB segment, approximately $700 million of loan balances were in deferral as of
September 30. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans on deferral posing credit risk to
PNC approximate 1% of total loan outstandings.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $155 million, down $81
million from the second quarter. Commercial net charge-offs were $38 million and consumer net charge-offs were
$117 million, both down linked-quarter. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was 24 basis points.
Total delinquencies of $1.2 billion at September 30 declined $72 million or 5%. Consumer loan delinquencies
decreased $41 million and commercial loan delinquencies declined $31 million.
Non-performing loans increased $209 million or 11% compared to June 30. The increase was primarily driven by
commercial real estate borrowers in the high-impact COVID-19 industries.
As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.58% at quarter end, up slightly from last quarter.
We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio.
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses year-to-date which have
increased $3.4 billion since December 31, 2019. As a result, our allowance for credit losses to total loans was
2.58%, and our allowance to non-performing loans was 276%. Our reserves have increased materially this year
due to the adoption of CECL and significant changes in the macroeconomic outlook during the first half of the
year. In the third quarter, portfolio changes, primarily driven by lower loan balances, reduced reserves by $158
million.
In addition, our economic outlook improved modestly during the quarter, but this was offset by increased reserves
for both commercial and consumer borrowers, adversely impacted by the pandemic. In total, this resulted in a
$150 million decline in our reserves to $6.4 billion.
In summary, PNC posted solid third quarter results, and we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this
challenging environment. For the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020, we expect average
loans to decline low single digits, we expect net interest income to be stable, we expect core fee income to be
stable, we expect other non-interest income to be between $275 million and $325 million resulting in our
expectation that total non-interest income will be down in the high single-digit range, we expect total non-interest
expense to be up approximately 1%. And in regard to net charge-offs, we expect fourth quarter levels to be
between $200 million and $250 million. Importantly, after taking all this into account, we're on pace to deliver
positive operating leverage between 3% and 4% for the full year of 2020.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Hey, good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the loan loss reserve, it looks like you released reserves a bit in the quarter, although your ACL percentage
increased given the loan balance decline. Is it fair to assume that if we do see charge-offs continue to increase
from here, like in the fourth quarter, for example, that we would expect that you probably still will not match the
charge-offs with provision and accordingly continue to put up loan loss reserve releases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There's a lot of variables that kind of go into that answer, John. But remember, again, when we put up the second
quarter reserve, the assumption based on our economic forecast in the models a bit was that we covered all of
the losses we knew about at that point in time. At the margin, the economy has gotten perhaps a little bit better on
the forecast. And so, we're kind of – as charge-offs go up, we're using in effect the reserves that we provided for
in the second quarter. So, that, all else equal, should continue unless we have deterioration from our current
forecast on what the economy is doing. But the general principle is all else equal, as loans run down and charge-
offs go through, that's what we've reserved for.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That's helpful. Got it. And then, on that same topic, the charge-off trajectory, just given what you expect in terms
of the ongoing migration you saw and indicated that the non-performers saw some pressure, when do you expect
that you'll see the greatest pressure and charge-offs build as this plays out? Are we looking more like the first half
of next year is where we get the greatest upside pressure in terms of loss content?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Again, it depends on a lot of things, not the least of which is what fiscal stimulus they put out there, if any. But all
else equal, it probably starts showing up in the second half of next year. My own belief is we're probably going to
see more pressure on COVID-sensitive industries, real estate earlier on and then consumers flow through as we
get into the back half of next year. But it all depends, where the consumer number, in my view, is going to be
highly dependent on whether they provide more fiscal stimulus which I think they absolutely need to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John, I would just add to that. I think it's all speculation at this point, but mid-2021 feels right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. No, that's helpful. If I could just ask one more, on the – just to ask the M&A question in a different way, Bill.
If we get a Biden victory next month and the political environment potentially could move more against big bank
deals, how does that influence your appetite for a larger deal? Could you pursue smaller bank deals given that or
possibly just view buybacks more attractively? Just want to get your thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, look, you're making a whole bunch of assumptions in there. The regulation, as I understand it, as it's written
in the laws, I understand it, and it's written basically to the extent that we were to do a deal and not cause a
systemic risk to the economy. Ultimately, it has to go through approval process and be approved. They can delay
it, they can hold hearings, they can do all sorts of different things, but basically it gets approved.
So even in a change in administration, the assumption that somehow they either change laws on this particular
issue – even if they switch governors, the regulatory process is still the same. So I don't know that that's a real
risk. I would say that, as we've always said, the smaller deals aren't off the table, but they require a fair amount of
work for less total return in effect. Can we do a bunch of them? Yeah, we could do a bunch of them over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Robert Q. Reilly A

changed.

Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just got a couple of questions on NII. Nice to see that you guys are expecting NII to be stable sequentially. And
I'm just wondering if you can help us flush out like what parts of the loan book are you still expecting to see come
down? And how is that being offset with other parts of the kind of earning asset statement in terms of being able
to keep the NII stable? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Ken. Good morning. Yeah, so when we take a look at the NII stable, there is obviously the earning
asset side and the liability side. I think we've made up a lot of ground on the liability side. I think we can still do
some more there. When we look at the fourth quarter in terms of loan balances; commercial, we still see being
relatively flattish. And, again, this all depends on what happens. And consumer, we could see some uptick there,
particularly if there's some stimulus.
I think the other factor for us and for the industry in terms of the fourth quarter will be the rate at which PPP loans
are forgiven. We have an expectation built into our guidance that about half of what we have will be forgiven. And
that's built into our guidance in the fourth quarter, and then the other half in the first quarter of 2021. So that's
probably the biggest play in terms of how NII and total loans...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But we continue to drop funding costs.

And we've got some more room to go.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. And my follow-up actually, Rob, is on that PPP front. The C&I loan yields were actually stable, down 1
basis point. I was wondering if you can help us understand the contribution from PPP-related interest income this
quarter versus last. And, again, how that plays through in terms of the yields and the forgiveness and fees and all
that? It gets really tricky, right? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It does. It does get a little tricky. I'd say, a good number for us in terms of our guidance would be about $100
million in NII related to PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter. So that'll help you size it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But straight C&I loan spread, I think we're up 7%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. Spreads up, yields are down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
They're still grinding down as we roll down into lower LIBORs, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. So about $100 million, Ken, on the PPP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

Do you have just what that was in the third quarter versus the $100 million?

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. Another firm that is going through this downturn solidly, JPMorgan, was essentially chomping
at the bit in terms of appetite for buybacks once the Fed lifts its restrictions. And Bill, I'm wondering, given the
amount of excess capital you're sitting on, if the Fed does lift at its restrictions by the first quarter or second
quarter of next year, how patient are you going to be in terms of thinking about your inorganic opportunities
versus buying back your stock here at a narrower premium to tangible book than the stock usually enjoys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So you should assume that we would otherwise be in the market, but you should also assume that we'll be patient
in – looking at acquisitions through time. Notwithstanding COVID, the environment for banks is going to be tough
going forward for all the obvious reasons. So we continue to think that there's going to be a lot of opportunities out
there.
The other thing with respect to buybacks, I mean, the only thing I think you ever know for certain is trying to spend
as much capital as we have all in a big hurry almost never works out and makes sense. So we'll be in the market
to a certain degree, but not enough that it changes our focus on the opportunities that we see in our [ph] deck
(00:26:27) and expansion through acquisition.

And as a follow-up question, this management team has always been ahead in terms of warning us about the
excesses that we're building up in the system pre-COVID. And I'm wondering as we think about the charge-offs
that were coming, as a follow-up to John's question, do you think that the current programs from the government
and the Fed have effectively redefined cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle, or are we just kicking the
realization down the road?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, they've definitely helped. But with PPP effectively running out and with CARES Act having run out, we're
going to see an acceleration. We did a survey into small business and smaller commercial and I think 60% of the
respondents, if I'm remembering this right, basically said, if this continues for another year, they'll be out of
business.

William Stanton Demchak A

Yeah, an incredible percentage. And a lot of those guys have gotten by either through PPP or simply drawing on
reserves and operating at an unsustainable level and something's got to give. My guess is and that's why we kind
of talk about charge-offs ramping up as we get into kind of the mid-back half of next year, my guess is it's still –
there's going to be a lot that's going to show up.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Bill, can you give us some thoughts? Obviously, you guys pointed out
that you have had $60 billion up at the Federal Reserve and clearly, that's weighing on your net interest margin
like your peers because of the influx in deposits. Can you kind of give us some color if that level, if your customers
just don't start using their deposits and it's now heading into the second quarter of next year, is there anything you
can do to shift that money out of there to get a higher yield without taking too much interest rate risk?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There's actually $70 billion there I think on a spot basis.

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, look, you're seeing it not just on the deposit side, but our utilization rate on credits down 1.6% I think
from the pre-COVID levels. The economy just isn't running, right? So, corporates are using less on their lines.
They're creating less inventory. They're doing less investment. They're holding more cash and I don't know that
that necessarily abates, particularly with the size of the Fed's balance sheet looking like it's going to remain at
least stable.
In terms of redeployment, it's hard to find something that you see in size that offers a good risk return. We're
doing a lot of things at the margin both on the lending side and some of the specialty finance areas and even on
the security side that offer a lot of value, but they're not enough to dent that amount of...

Substantially faster.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And trying to force that outcome, so right, we can just go out and buy $70 billion worth of 10-years at 70
basis points, and to make a lot of money for some short period of time. It's a lousy risk return trade-off. So, we'll
be opportunistic, but my best guess is we're going to be sitting on a lot of cash for a pretty long period of time as
well the whole banking industry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, moving over to credit, obviously, you guys have been through cycles before. And is there –
aside from what has caused this down cycle we all know was quite unique, when you look at the commercial
credits that you've been forced to write down or the commercial real estate that you have been forced to write
down, there have been many different or any differences between what you saw in the last cycle or the 1990s
cycle in terms of write-downs that has surprised you, or is it just very similar to the past downturns?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No, it's – I mean, if you go all the way back, most real estate problems historically came from projects, so office
buildings that were built that were never occupied. So, you can remember Boston when you could see straight
through downtown, because nobody was in it. That's where the big losses historically have come from. This is an
instance where real estate is struggling, even though in theory, everything is leased up, right? But you have – if
you think about retail, nobody is paying rent, right? So, malls are getting killed and they were already on a decline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hotels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hotels are obvious. A lot of things that, in a normal downturn, would have probably still cash flowed and been fine
or struggling from a cash flow basis. Interestingly, in this one, versus the other ones, the loan to values for the
assets, notwithstanding the lack of cash flow, still look pretty good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Very good. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, this is real estate come up with yet another way to hurt the industry again.

Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Bill, you said in response to John Pancari's earlier question that the consumer number will depend on whether
there's more physical stimulus. Would you expect stimulus to be less beneficial on the commercial side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a fair question. It depends if they redo PPP in some form. That obviously helped out thousands and thousands
and thousands of smaller business commercial borrowers and kept people employed. The consumer side, one of
the things we've watched and have talked about before is the extra $600 that came in from the CARES Act for
unemployment benefits allowed consumers to substantially build cash balances and pay down debt. Now that that
has gone away, you're basically seeing the balance excess they had in their DDA accounts decline, which is why
I'm worried about consumers.
But no, look, if they redid PPP, it would substantially affect the amount of small business commercial charge-offs
we've had. Small business – and you guys already know this, the small business commercial – people who have
less access to other forms of capital are really getting hurt in this environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. I guess, following up on your CRE comments, it seems like there maybe greater
willingness among banks to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. But maybe there's a bit
less patience, for example, with some, say, CMBS conduits set up by private equity companies.

And then that raises the question of whether the likelihood of foreclosure is higher outside of the banking system.
Do you think that's the case? And if so, do you think it could result in growing pressure on commercial real estate
prices?
And then, maybe sort of just to cap off, like, can you share your thoughts on how an effective vaccine by, say,
mid-2021 would impact your view of the ultimate loss content within CRE? There's a lot there, but would just love
to hear your thoughts on those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:35:14). So at the margin, banks have always been more willing to work with borrowers
than a contractual CMBS relationship where that Midland – where – is a fiduciary working on behalf of the various
credit tranches. Having said that, we've actually been surprised by the turnover that we've seen in our special
servicing portfolio in Midland.
So we've actually seen a couple of things. One, the B-piece buyers being willing to work with borrowers probably
in a way they haven't in past environments; and two, to the extent that they say no, take the asset, there's a lot of
capital on the sidelines from traditional B-piece buyers...

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...who are effectively writing it off in one fund and rebuying it in another one. So the turnover has been pretty high.
A bit to my surprise, there's a pretty active secondary market for real estate properties at the moment. Probably it
doesn't carry through to all types. I imagine there's not a good bid for strip malls, but for other types of properties,
there's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's fair. If I may squeeze in one last one. Bill, can you share your thoughts around the direct neobanks, sort of
the Chimes and others out there that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of
post-COVID environment. How you see their presence impacting the competitive environment over, say, the next
three to five years? And is there any potential benefit to deploying some of the BlackRock proceeds on a
neobank, or are those sort of capabilities things that you think you can build on your own?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm trying to contain myself. I wish we had the opportunity to basically not have to make any money and grow
customers by giving stuff away and running our back office on a third-party bank system that's written in COBOL
from 50 years ago. But we don't have that luxury.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The tech capability of these guys, there's nothing that they have that we don't have; nothing that they have that
we can't produce, if we wanted to have. Our platforms are much more modern than their platforms. They're all
running on third-party banks, which is a whole another issue that drives me insane. And they basically do free
accounts and no overdraft and simple simplification. They find very low balance customers, and I just don't think
long-term that model works. I think that delivery – multiple delivery channel model that includes real care centers
and customer service, we see that through our NPS scores, through ATM delivery networks, through branch
delivery networks and through top line digital, is going to win.

So, Bill, you certainly have been ahead in expressing concern about the way this COVID situation plays out, or
how do you feel, just in the last three months, on the one hand, you do see the fixed income market securities
which have come in, and I know you know that market, you have low line utilizations, which means probably that
firms aren't quite ready to go bankrupt. You see your charge-off rate being exceptionally low. On the other hand,
who knows, if we have a second wave, it's a W or how that plays out. So, just what's your temperature on the
outlook over the next couple of years? And do you have seller remorse for selling BlackRock, or do you say, hey,
you know what, I feel even better today?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, a couple of things going into this. If we look at the corporate side, notwithstanding utilization being
down, corporate America is levered four times today. We went into the crisis levered three times, which we all
thought was high. None of that has changed. The one thing that gives me a little bit of comfort, certainly relative to
my initial concerns on this environment as I think we've defined the downside, Mike, so when we went into this,
we really had no idea of what, in fact, the downside could be. We didn't know mortality rates. There were no real
treatments for COVID, there was no vaccine on the – so, all of the things – we didn't know how to define the
downside.
So, I think the best thing I can tell you is I think we've defined the downside is that we at this point muddle along
pretty much where we are in the economy. And I think that plays out through time and I think losses grind out
through time. As we said, we think at this point, we're reserved for that environment.
Do I have seller's remorse? I don't and not surprisingly, I've gotten that question. I think there's a lot of things I
regret in life with hindsight. And all else equal, I wish we were selling BlackRock today at $650 as opposed to
when we sold them at the start of this thing. But I think with the information we had in our hands, it was the right
decision. I hope that people – and I know a number of our shareholders bought BlackRock when we sold it. I hope
you bought it and rode that stock up. That was always your choice.
We were always going to be left with this basic notion that eventually, we were going to have a tax burden that
looks like it's going to come to fruition. Eventually, we were going to have regulatory pressure. Eventually – and
not eventually, we already had a concentrated asset that was outside of our control. And I'd much rather deploy
that capital into something that is within our control. So, I wouldn't change the decision based on what we knew at
the time and what our strategic direction is and what I think the opportunity set is going forward. I still remain – I'm
trying to find the right word here, but confident that having capital in this coming environment is going to be
incredibly valuable and open up a lot of inorganic opportunities for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, just to your point, there's a lot of the game left to play.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Anybody who thought we'd have the S&P where it is today when we sold BlackRock, give me a call,
because I'll invest some money with you. I just – that was, if I made a mistake, and I've made many in my life, that
was probably my one mistake.
