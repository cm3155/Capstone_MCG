Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us on the call today. Performance this quarter
was exceptionally strong and our results underscore the power of our vibrant and growing businesses. Despite
the rapidly changing operating environment over the past 18 months or so, we've executed against our strategic
goals, expanding our market leading capabilities and driving momentum across all areas of the company.
Do It Right serves as our mantra and provides great clarity to our actions inside and outside the walls of Ally. I'm
tremendously proud of our Ally teammates uphold our values in meaningful ways every day.
Since Ally Bank launched 12 years ago you've seen us constantly challenge the status quo through innovative,
seamless and differentiated consumer-based products, services and experiences. In June we were the first major
bank to announce the elimination of overdraft fees for all customers. While eliminating the revenue stream was
viewed by many as unprecedented and by some as controversial, this was a logical step for us in continuing to
redefine traditional bank norms in advancing our mission to create a better and more equitable banking
relationship for everyone.
The success of our all-digital banking platform is reflected in the accelerating growth across several measures
including sustained rapid expansion of engaged customers, industry-leading retention of balances and
accountholders, and steady growth over the past five years among customers who use multiple Ally bank
products. Our model will continue to evolve to meet the increasing demand among consumers for frictionless and
simplified experiences, enhancing our ability to further unlock additional franchise value in the years ahead.
For our Ally teammates, we remain relentlessly focused on fostering an engaged, equitable, and inclusive culture
while prioritizing their well-being. We're encouraged by the reduction in COVID cases and growth of vaccinated
populations across the nation, but obviously mindful of variants like Delta that are still presenting risks.
At Ally we recently announced our intention to begin welcoming our workforce back to the office after Labor Day,
but pilot programs already underway today show that teammates were ready and excited to get back together.
Our teammates across the company have gone to considerable lengths to balance the complexities involved in
this environment, demonstrating a Do It Right approach in their thoughtful planning. I am incredibly proud, again,
of how we have balance doing right for our teammates and doing right for our company.
On top of the great financial and operational results, this morning I'm pleased to announce a $50 million
contribution to the Ally Charitable Foundation, a significant financial commitment for driving lasting and positive
change.
Our foundation was active in the quarter, partnering with Habitat for Humanity of Charlotte to launch one of the
largest affordable housing efforts today addressing a critical shortage in housing within historically black
neighborhoods. We also increased our partnership with the University Growth Fund as they expanded in Atlanta.
These efforts help college students from underrepresented groups gain real world investment experience
including in areas like private equity. We're thrilled to support these and many other organizations in the important
work they do to advance social and educational causes. The measurable progress we've made for our customers
employees and communities is another source of pride for me, and I'm confident in the significant role these
efforts have played in building a stronger company.
Let's turn to slide number 5, where I'll touch on a few highlights from 2Q. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.33,
core ROTCE of 26.7% and revenues of $2.1 billion, each represented record-setting levels for Ally, driven by

organic revenue expansion and strong credit trends. While a favorable backdrop across consumer and auto
markets accentuated financial results during the quarter, it's important to recognize the underlying drivers of Ally's
broader performance.
First, as you've heard from us on several occasions, results of this magnitude reflect years of disciplined
execution, and our adaptability and creativity has enhanced our ability to capitalize on market opportunities in real
time. Second and critically important is that meaningful expansion opportunities remain ahead for Ally as we
continue to grow our company and unlock incremental value within auto, insurance and Ally Bank. These
dynamics serve as the cornerstones of our long term operational and financial expansion, which we steadily
delivered against over the past several years.
Jenn will provide more detail that we expect full year 2021 performance to exceed normalized returns, while our
long term outlook for sustainable ROTCE profile in the solid mid-teens represents our strongest level as a publicly
traded company. Performance will be driven by ongoing core earnings expansion, fueled by robust dealer
engagement and deepened customer relationships across our digital bank offerings. Our continued progress
allowed us to announce a 25% expansion to our share buyback program and increase our dividend for the sixth
time in as many years. Disciplined capital management in accordance with the SCV regulatory framework is a
continuous part of our focus.
Turning to our business performance, within auto, consumer originations of $12.9 billion represented our highest
level in 15 years at a solid 7.15% yield. We focus on being the preeminent dealer partner evidenced in the record
3.5 million applications we decisioned this quarter and with a pathway for further expansion as we deepen
relationships across our 19,700 dealers.
For the first time in our history, credit for the quarter was a net recovery, reflecting the resilience of the auto asset
class including strong consumer demand, broad strength and health among consumers, including the benefits of
meaningful, fiscal and monetary actions, and our focused and modernized approach to underwriting and
collections. Credit trends remain encouraging, reducing the likelihood of protracted elevated losses as the gradual
migration back to more normalized levels becomes more likely over the next 12 to 18 months.
Importantly, we use this time to further enhance our ability to reach our auto customers through expanded digital
channels coupled with enhanced analytics within our servicing teams. We constantly monitor broader market
indicators of consumer health including wage and price inflation, employment conditions and productivity
measures. While there are several crosscurrents today, I remain of the view that consumers are well-positioned
with healthy balance sheets, increasing their willingness and ability to borrow and pay.
Auto sector competition remained intense but balanced overall as vehicle sales were robust, particularly for non-
fleet retail sales. Strong demand continued to outpace OEM production, pushing industry inventories to multi
decade lows, which in turn is providing structural support for used values. We expect floorplan balances to remain
low and used values elevated for some time before beginning to steadily migrate towards more normalized levels.
Based on what we see today and in conversations we have with the dealer community, this will take us into next
year.
Within insurance written premiums of $301 million reflected our highest second quarter of consumer volume
driven by increased market share and strong vehicle sales. Investment portfolio performance remained solid while
weather claims were the lowest 2Q in over a decade.

Turning to Ally Bank, organic and accelerating growth trends continued. Retail deposit customers ended at nearly
$2.4 million, expanding 12% year-over-year and representing our 49th consecutive quarter of growth. Retail
balances grew to $129 billion even as seasonally higher customer tax payments increased about 70% year-over-
year.
Our consumer product adoption trends remained exceptional. Ally Home originations of $2.2 billion increased
more than 80% compared to the prior-year period. Ally Invest self-directed customer assets grew to $15.6 billion,
a 62% year-over-year increase while accounts expanded 11%. And Ally Lending volume of $299 million increased
nearly fourfold year-over-year as we expanded merchant relationships and volume across healthcare, home
improvement and retail verticals.
Corporate finance posted another steady and solid quarter with combined help for investment and unfunded
commitments exceeding $10 billion for the third consecutive quarter including $6.2 billion of HFI balances.
Performance across all of our businesses reinforces our broad customer reach, years of disciplined execution,
adaptability of our businesses, and ability to meet our financial and operational goals.
On slide number 6, our ongoing financial trajectory is evident across each of these key metrics, with trends having
accelerated following widespread impacts experienced at the onset of the pandemic. In the upper right we've
included PPNR which we know many of you look to as a measure of core earnings power and as a key metric
used by the Fed during CCAR exercises. We surpassed $1 billion this quarter and expect to generate annual
growth in the years ahead, though this may not always occur in a perfectly linear manner from quarter to quarter.
On the bottom right of the page tangible book value per share reached an all-time high of $38.83, reiterating the
growth in intrinsic value of our company as our return profile has sustainably improved. As you've heard from me
in the past, values, culture, and disciplined execution remain central to our operating mindset and we're excited to
build upon our momentum in the years ahead as we continue to drive and improved earnings and return profile.
With that, Jenn, I'll hand it to you to review the detailed financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. The strength of our financial performance again this quarter reflects
our disciplined operating approach and the continued execution of our long-term strategic priorities.
Before I review the details, I'd like to thank our Ally teammates for their ongoing commitment which underpins our
strong performance and accelerating trajectory. We've built deeply integrated auto and digital banking
experiences for dealers and consumers, enhancing Ally's franchise value and affording us the opportunity to
protect and improve our market share, grow our loan portfolios, and diversify income sources and generate a
solid mid-teens return profile in the years ahead.
We're well aware of the debate on whether prevailing market trends represent peak performance for companies.
And while we acknowledge used car values and credit trends will migrate toward normalized levels over time, we
continue to focus on expanding our industry leading businesses, delivering a sustainable core earnings trajectory
that is structurally higher than pre-pandemic levels and prudent management of capital and liquidity.
On slide 7 net financing revenue excluding OID of $1.56 billion reached the highest level on record for Ally
growing 13% in quarter and 46% year-over-year. Performance was fueled by ongoing strength in auto pricing and
origination volume, elevated used car values, optimization among funding sources and benefits from

redeployment of excess liquidity. Adjusted other revenue of $588 million reflected another solid quarter of
investment gains and continued growth among our smart option, mortgage, invest and insurance operations.
We repositioned $70 million of OID expense associated with the retirement of $2.4 billion trust preferred
securities. In Q3, we expect to reposition around $50 million aligned with the July closing of the second
redemption. We opportunistically replaced this floating rate instrument with five- and seven-year fixed rate
perpetual preferred securities which improves the quality of our Tier 1 capital and positions us favorably in rising
rate environments.
Negative provision expense this quarter reflects the benefits of robust consumer dynamics that led to a net
recovery in retail auto. Non-interest expense included $90 million of significant items detailed below related to the
contribution to the Ally Foundation and modifications to our retirement eligibility benefits. We remain focused on
essentialism and generating positive operating leverage even while we continue to make prudent investments in
innovation to enhance dealer and customer experiences, technology, security and brand.
Core pre-tax earnings exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter driving GAAP and adjusted EPS of
$2.41 and $2.33 respectively. Within GAAP tax expense, we recognized a discrete tax items that lowered our
quarterly tax rate.
Moving to slide 8, net interest margin excluding OID of 3.57% expanded 39 basis points quarter-over-quarter and
115 basis points year-over-year reflecting significant and sustained improvement. Earning asset yield of 4.69%
grew 25 basis points quarter-over-quarter while average earning assets of nearly $175 billion reflected steady
retail and auto expansion sourced through strong originations at accretive pricing levels, growth in lease balances
and yields aided by elevated used car values, ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity, and higher Ally Lending
debt balances at attractive yields.
These dynamics largely offset prepayment activity in mortgage and lower floorplan balances stemming from
robust consumer demand and continued supply chain constraints. We expect full year retail auto origination yields
in the 7% range and now expect used car values to rise in the mid to upper 20% range year-over-year [ph] at
(00:18:42) the mid-30% rise during the first half of 2021, an outlook that contemplates more normalized pricing
and a substantial rise in car values that began in the latter part of last year. Impacts from elevated used car
values have been partly offset by higher liquidity levels and premium amortization, trends we expect to normalize
over time.
Turning to liabilities, cost of funds improved 15 basis points, the eighth consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline.
As you've heard from us before, our interest rate risk position is relatively neutral and we remain confident in our
ability to thrive in both higher and lower rate environments given our balance sheet positioning. While we continue
to prefer a steeper curve, we are not overly dependent on rates to drive margin improvement.
Ally's liability transformation asset growth and pricing tailwinds on both sides of the balance sheet will drive
ongoing NIM and NII expansion. Our margin performance has been meaningfully enhanced through years of
transformation and organic growth. Since 2014, consumer auto assets have grown $10 billion as we partner with
more dealers, decisioned more applications, and developed deep expertise to drive improved risk adjusted return.
Corporate Finance, Ally Lending and mortgage assets including Ally Home have expanded by over $11 billion,
doubling the 2014 ending levels as we diversify our growing Ally Bank customers and clients. We've transformed
our liability stack, reducing reliance on high cost 100% data wholesale funding [ph] if we (00:20:31) build stable
sticky deposits. We are now 89% deposit-funded, double the 2014 level, and we've retired $24 billion of

unsecured over this timeframe at a weighted average coupon in excess of 5%. These structural improvements
position our balance sheet for a sustainable 3%-plus NIM moving forward versus low to mid-2% levels in years
past.
Turning to slide 9, CET1 increased to 11.3% in Q2 representing $3.2 billion of excess capital above our 9%
internal target. Last week, we increased our Q3 dividend to $0.25 per share and expanded our 2021 buyback
program by $400 million, reflective of Ally's strong capital levels, earnings profile, and outlook.
On the bottom of this slide, outstanding shares have declined 25% since the inception of the buyback program,
and we repurchased $719 million (sic) [$721 million] (00:21:40) during the first half of this year. Our approach to
capital deployment remains centered around prioritizing opportunities for long-term value enhancement.
On slide 10, asset quality reflected historically strong performance across our consumer and commercial
portfolios. Consolidated net charge-offs were negative 2 basis points, the lowest level in our 102-year history.
Retail auto portfolio performance reflected solid consumer payment trends and improved loss given default rates.
In the bottom right, early and late stage delinquencies ended meaningfully below prior year levels. These are
encouraging trends supporting our expectation for losses to migrate toward a normalized 1.4% to 1.6% NPL level
over the medium term, which is contemplated in our reserve and pricing approaches and included in our return
projection.
On slide 11, consolidated coverage was stable at 2.79% as retail auto and Ally Lending balances grew, and
floorplan which carry significantly lower coverage declined. Retail auto coverage of 3.7% declined by 10 basis
points from favorable consumer behavior and improved macroeconomic indicators. Our forecast assumes
gradually improving unemployment, ending the year between 4% and 5%. Signs of economic improvement
continue to emerge, evidenced in rising competence levels, widespread employment opportunities, and ongoing
gains in productivity and manufacturing. We continually monitor wage and price inflation trends and assess
consumer debt dynamics in real-time, but remain confident our reserves are well-positioned for a variety of
economic environments including downside scenarios.
On slide 12, total deposits grew to $139 billion. Retail balances expanded by nearly $900 million quarter-over-
quarter even as seasonal tax outflows were significantly higher than previous years and we continue to lower
broker deposits. Underlying retail trends remain robust including inflows from both new and existing customers.
We added another 60,000 customers during the quarter with nearly 70% representing digitally savvy younger
generation early in their financial journey.
Looking deeper in the portfolio dynamics every annual vintage since 2009 has grown or remained stable, a
testament to our brand value and the stability of balances across rate cycles and rapidly evolving competition.
Customer loyalty and engagement are reflected in industry-leading retention of 96% and multi-relationship
expansion for the 17th consecutive quarter ending at 9%.
Turning to slide 13, as the largest all digital bank in the US, Ally Bank is uniquely positioned to benefit from
ongoing consumer shifts to all things digital. This is evidenced in our robust customer growth, expanding at a 19%
CAGR since 2010. Deposits serve as the gateway to our rapidly expanding bank which continues to drive loyalty
and deepen customer relationships through Ally's save, invest, pay and mortgage lending capabilities. The
significant portion of Ally Invest account openings in Ally Home direct to consumer volume continues to be
sourced from existing depositors, accelerating organic growth and diversification in the years ahead.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Let's turn to slide 14 to review auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of $917 million was driven by net financing
revenue growth from ongoing optimization in the consumer portfolio and strong used values expansion of smart
option and ClearPath activities and solid credit performance. Retail portfolio trends shown in the bottom right
highlight our strong risk-adjusted margin trend fueled by solid origination yields and credit performance.
Turning to slide 15, our leading agile platform is built to meet dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive and
innovative manner, reflected in our performance and multi-year growth of dealer relationships. Our focus
continues to migrate towards deepening these relationships, driving strong application trends which we expect to
approach $13 million this year. In the upper right, ending consumer assets expanded to $86.5 billion. Both retail
and lease growth demonstrates the resilience of the auto asset class in a challenged loan growth environment as
we expanded volumes and units.
Average commercial balances ended at $16.3 billion as industry inventories reached a 36-year low. The floorplan
contraction has been driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain dynamics that have improved dealer
profitability by lowering inventory carry costs and enhancing used vehicle values.
Turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page, auto volume of $12.9 billion represented our highest
quarterly level since 2006. We've continued to provide broad access to credit for consumers, utilizing our full
spectrum underwriting capabilities while maintaining consistent FICO and nonprime trends.
Turning to insurance results on slide 16, core pre-tax income of $67 million increased year-over-year from
underwriting income growth and notably lower weather losses. While investment activity declined quarter-over-
quarter, realized gains still rank as a top 10 quarter over the past decade. In the bottom left, the investment
balances grew to $6.4 billion providing a diversified stable revenue stream and enhanced returns. Total written
premiums of $301 million reflects consumer F&I strength where we generated $274 million in volume leading to
our highest number of total consumer policies. P&C volume reflected lower industry inventories, though newly
onboarded dealers and rate changes mitigated the overall decline.
Turning to slide 17, core income of $96 million was the highest quarterly results on record for corporate finance
reflecting stable net financing revenue, strong other revenue from investment gains, syndication income and
growth in unused commitment fees, and favorable credit trends which allowed us to modestly reduce coverage.
The loan portfolio remains high quality comprised of 52% asset-based lending, up from 25% in 2014. Our $6.2
billion HFI portfolio and $4.3 billion unfunded commitments position us for ongoing revenue expansion. While
client utilization levels remain low and competition is fierce, we remain confident in the outlook for growth.
Mortgage details are on slide 18. The breakeven income reflects a shift from HFS to HFI originations and impacts
from elevated prepayment activity over the past several quarters. Ally Home's DTC originations of $2.2 billion
represented our highest quarterly level since launching in 2016. Customer engagement remains strong with
nearly 40% of our originations sourced from existing depositors, further underscoring the significance of our
growing multi-product relationships. The path to $10 billion in annual DTC volume over the next couple of years
remains within reach even as the broader market is expected to decline as we build scale through existing and
new customers.
On slide 19, we've refreshed the financial outlook given our strong results. We now expect ROTCE in the 20%
range for this year, excluding the impact of reserve release activity. Performance will be fueled by 20% plus year-
over-year total revenue growth and operating leverage gains in the mid-teens range.

The chart also demonstrates the significant long-term momentum we've generated across the company
evidenced in the sustainable 15% plus return profile. Ongoing results will be fueled by revenue-driven PPNR
expansion. NII will reflect the loan growth and net interest margin in the mid to upper 3% range. Steadily
expanding other revenues will result organic growth from our established and broad-end consumer offerings.
And as a reminder, we assume modest investment gain activity, but will remain opportunistic in the years ahead.
Our outlook and that balanced competitive and operating environment assumptions including normalized trends
across used car prices credit activity and deposit market growth. We are confident in the value we're generating
across our businesses driving near and long term benefits for all our stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Thank you, Jenn. I'll close with a few comments on slide number 20. First, I remain deeply grateful and proud to
lead our company. Our results this quarter are really impressive. But our broader purpose and calls to serve our
teammates, our customers, our communities and our stockholders is what defines the long term success that still
remains ahead for Ally. We built a structurally enhanced fundamentally stronger company through strategic
execution across our business lines and balance sheet optimization. This positions us for a long term outlook
which is brighter now than at any other point in our company's history.
We will continue to execute with the focus on the same values and priorities that have served us well. And the
future's bright for all things Ally. So Daniel, with that turn it back to you and we can head into Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.
Your line is now open.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning.

Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hey, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, JB, Jenn, maybe talk about how you can manage through the normalization of used car prices via
underwriting, and maybe just talk about what assumptions are baked into your intermediate term net interest
margin guidance.
And sorry, can maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing in smart option in terms of lease gains? Are
you starting to see any signs of normalization? And what are your expectations as you look out over the next 6 to
18 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Ryan. So just a couple of comments on where we are with used car prices. We can get into
some of the dynamics on smart option. But clearly first half of this year, used vehicle pricing is up kind of over
30% and in second quarter up over 40%. We are expecting, Ryan, for used car pricing to start to normalize in the
back half of this year.
Now I think the question is around the pacing of that. We do think we've kind of passed the peak and we would
migrate down to more normalized levels at a minimum by 2023. And that's what is embedded in our kind of
medium-term guidance around 2022, 2023, 15-plus percent ROTCE.
I think a lot of dynamics there and we hit on these in the prepared remarks but we're continuing to see incredibly
strong demand for personal vehicle ownership. We actually think some of that could be pushed out simply
because of availability of new and used vehicles coupled with on the supply side we've seen the chip shortage is
going to continue to pressure inventory levels.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
And so while we are expecting the normalization, I think the big question, Ryan, is quite frankly when will that
happen. I think you know us. we tend to be pretty conservative in how we model this and we are expecting it to
come down at least in our modeled numbers through 2022 and 2023.
On your question on underwriting, look, we never change underwriting for pockets of abnormal activity. And so,
we have embedded normalized used vehicle pricing and LGD and off-lease as well in underwriting for both lease
and lending. So we feel really good about our pricing approach. Obviously, our reserves include much more
normalized levels.
And then, on smart option, not as – not quite as many cars as we would have liked. We are seeing kind of dealer
buyouts increase simply because of the demand for inventory on lots and their appetite to sell metal. So we're not
seeing quite the activity we'd like to on smart options. But the gains are coming in just huge as we saw in Q2 and
then will be modest in terms of assumption here on out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe if I can ask one follow up. I mean, the business is obviously generating outstanding returns
right now. You're talking about 20% plus this year. You're benefiting from elevated used car prices. So JB, can
you maybe just talk about your prioritization in terms of how you think about accelerating investments in some of
the new businesses that can drive revenue growth versus potentially accelerating capital repatriation? You've
obviously increased the dividend by a decent chunk and you're going to be buying back $2 billion of stock versus
over the next year. But I'm just curious how you think about that relative trade-off of accelerating some
investments given the outsized profits versus continuing to return a lot of capital to shareholders? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question, Ryan. And I guess it's a blend of both for us right now. So as you pointed out we
were really happy to be able to announce higher capital returns, the dividend and buybacks.
And even having said that we're still running elevated levels of capital. I think the 11.3% CET1 is still 230 basis
points higher and that's a real amount of dollars than our internal target that we want to run. So going into this
year's planning process, Jenn and I are really working with our business leaders on trying to think through what
we're calling kind of unconstrained growth.
So what are the higher growth scenarios that we could deploy to drive better organic levels both in terms of
balance sheet and revenue opportunities. I think we continue to be very tactical in what we're doing on the
technology side, the digital side, the cyber investment side. Those are some of the near-term investments, what
Jenn and I have green lighted to accelerate.
And then also the same thing on the brand side, well Ally Bank brand and the Ally brand overall continues to
resonate extremely well. I think relative to some of our competitors we are underspent there, we are
underinvested there and we think there's broader opportunities and promoting the brand doing more and digital
acceleration with the brand.
We have a great Chief Marketing Officer in Andrea Brimmer and she's got some world-class teammates that are
trying to really push forward what we do in the digital analytics side there. So we're super excited and I think it's
going to be a fun year. I think the board is on board with us and kind of pushing the company forward. So we're

proud of the foundation that's been established. But I think now it's really about pushing for even higher levels
than we've achieved to date. So hopefully that's helpful, Ryan.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning and good quarter. Things are really solid. And just a quick question on the originations,
obviously very strong quarter originations, could you just speak to how you see that unfolding for the remainder of
the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Sanjay, and thank you for the question. So our originations approach $13 billion this
quarter and it sets us up really nicely for a full year originations. We're expecting strong flows through Q3 and Q4
and likely will exceed $40 billion. We always talk about our strategy is not to chase volume but we'll be
opportunistic when we see it.
And we are certainly seeing it this year, evidenced in kind of the strongest originations we've seen in 15 years.
And we continue to see opportunities to hit that kind of 7% retail auto origination yield in 2021 as well.
So think about kind of, Sanjay, a number in the $40 billion to $45 billion and then we'll continue to see how things
unfold into 2022 and 2023. Again, no new volume targets but with our rapidly expanding distribution, JB
mentioned it's our 29th quarter consecutively of growing dealers. And then the team is all over relationship
deepening right now. So we hit record application flows. We're not seeing any sign of that stopping based on the
operating environment but more specifically just our strategic positioning across our dealer base and our product
set right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then I guess the follow question to Ryan, just a question on capital. I guess when we think about the
excess capital, some of it could be used towards M&A. Are there any opportunities out there that you're seeing, is
there a pipeline of things are contemplating? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sanjay, I'd say we always try to stay opportunistic and open. I think the position we find ourselves in today though
is we've got dominant franchises in auto and the bank and we're seeing all these new businesses really start to
grow and scale on top of what auto continues to do.
So we're in this fortunate position where we don't feel force to have to do anything and I think that's probably
different than some of our banking competitors. And so we'll always stay open. The Ally Lending business is
obviously new. We're impressed with leadership there, the way they've integrated into Ally and the scalability of
that business. But – and that's an entree into this universe of unsecured consumer lending.
I think there's still a broader question. Is there something bigger? Should we accelerate what we're doing there.
Do we have a broader opportunity? But we're just we find ourselves in a really great position today as the
business' the business model has been validated. So we're not in a rush or a race to do anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Can you give a bit more color on your discussions with your dealers around floorplan
levels and the possibility that they'll be able to run with less inventory? And also if you could remind us what kind
of impact smaller dealer floorplan balances will have on Ally's profitability?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Good morning, Bill. Maybe I'll start with the dealer floorplan impacts and we can trickle back to the
dealer question. But on floorplan, I mean obviously, that's impacting our balance sheet and we've continued to
see loans in the commercial space dip down.
And we think we've hit the trough here in the second quarter. We could kind of bounced around at these levels for
another couple of months but we do expect kind of back half of this year to see a commercial start to grow again
and normalize kind of through 2022, 2023. It is going to take some time, no doubt, especially with continued
strong consumer demand and then supply chain shortages just from chips as well as other constraints.
So, expecting to see that turn around a bit towards the back half of this year but it's going to be a slow, kind of,
and steady recovery.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
I think what's great for Ally is that we have natural hedges and with the lighter floorplan you're seeing used vehicle
values continue to climb we had kind of 40-plus-percent in the second quarter we're expecting 25% to 30%
increase in used vehicle values that's obviously showing up in our lease yields through slower depreciation as
well as lease gains. And it's also showing up in our loss given default from a loss perspective. We're in a net
recovery position this quarter as you've seen.
So the natural hedges offset the balance sheet decreases that we've seen on the floorplan side, and net-net set
us up to generate really robust returns and earnings. And quite frankly it's the same for our dealers. They're
seeing margin expansion, we're hitting kind of record numbers of dealers that are profitable right now due to some
of these dynamics on the inventory side, lower carry costs, high vehicle values.
In terms of kind of their views on where we are, I think the sentiment, and JB can add on, but the sentiment is this
is going to take some time. And I think because dealer profitability is still high, there is no rush to kind of – to
increase inventory, increase carry cost. I think there has been some smart learnings that have come out of this
and it always makes sense to build for demand as opposed to build supply and hope the demand comes. And so,
we're hopeful that the OEMs as well as the dealers will continue to take some of these lessons learned into future
operational practices. But JB, anything you'd add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thank you. As a follow up, I wanted to ask about branding. You guys have had tremendous success with
the build out of the deposit franchise, but is there an active focus on doing more to continue to develop the Ally
brand inside the organization with the goal of just ultimately being seen as more than – beyond the provider of a
balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Bill. Do you have a direct line to Andrea...
[indiscernible] (00:46:19)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, in fact, we are – as JB mentioned, we are in active dialog right now. We're launching our strategic
planning process and we're in active dialog around how we can continue to be thoughtful – share the Ally story
with our customers. We have a terrific product set across both sides of the balance sheet, adding to our wealth
management capabilities.
So, we think there's just terrific opportunity ahead to accelerate the growth of our new businesses and to continue
to dominate across auto and deposits. So, absolutely, and I can kind of hear Andrea cheering from a couple floors
down around us.
Now, of course we want to do it smartly and we want to make sure that we position the brand effectively just being
mindful of generating positive operating leverage. But with that said, we would agree.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:47:14) just to add on a little bit there too, as – I mean today, we've got ballpark around
numbers 9 million customers. I think the unique thing for us is they're active, they're engaged, we're growing the
multi-product nature of the customer base as well.
So it's all about what we're really trying to optimize if we wanted the higher headline customer number, we could
target for that. But I think what's been very important and what's been guiding us is, get a customer in the door,
grow around them, help them see the holistic nature of the brand. I mean we're very proud of using a subset of
the customer base, 2.4 million at the bank, I mean to see a 96% retention rate on our customer base, this is
something about our brand and the quality of our service, but as Jim pointed out Andrea is always looking to grow
and optimize. And our new advertisements promote kind of the holistic nature of Ally.
So you'll see more from us. Obviously we continue to grow our sports marketing footprint and what we've done on
the [ph] Champions Tour (00:48:30), with Women's Soccer, with MLS coming, and then obviously a really
dominant position in NASCAR today. We think the sports marketing approach also drives pretty incredible brand
value there as well, so.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a solid quarter. The most of my questions
were around residual values and you guys have addressed those. So I guess one thing is it's – I think back in
2016, 2017 you kind of gave us an indication of kind of I think it was like a 5% year-over-year decline in residual
values or used car pricing to kind of give us just a sense where your head's at and how you're resetting your
depreciation curve and so forth. Do you have anything that's that straightforward for us thinking about 2022 and
where you might be kind of pinpointing expected residual value declines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So good morning, John. So let me start with this year. So we are expecting this year to land kind of up 25%
to high 20% range. The first half of this year is up 35% or so, above 30%, and so we are expecting the back half
to start to normalize.
And without getting too specific around kind of 2022 and 2023 numbers which is a lot to work through to have a
clear view, but by 2023 what we've modeled in our guide is that we do get back to kind of a much more
normalized lease yield. So we always talked about kind of 4.5% to 5% pre-gains and then add another percent or
so for gains. And so we do expect to get back to that much more normalized yield by 2023.

Now as I mentioned, there is definitely a bull case out there just as we look at continued demand for vehicles as
well as the supply shortages, but we don't model in any kind of extraordinary results into the guide. We have
much more normalized projections.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's super helpful. Appreciate that, Jenn. And then, JB, thinking about that you guys had a lot of
applications and thinking about your conversion rate and maybe just sort of commentary on what you see going
on in terms of underwriting quality across the industry as banks may be coming back into the fray, and how you
guys respond from a competitive perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I mean it's been overall pretty balanced competition. I mean the market as we've seen for quite some
time has been intense. I think as we've probably talked about for a year or so, there's been rumors of players
coming back in. But it really hasn't disrupted flow or competition or things that we see or certainly any of the
pricing dynamics. I mean if you look at some of our pages in the deck, some of the supplemental financial
information, we haven't really changed anything on underwriting standards. We've kind of been running the same
type of FICO trend, same type of focus on our [ph] SA tiers (00:51:57) of business because we're generating
really, really solid returns there.
I mean when you think about we're now at probably 12 quarters or so of run in this 7%-plus yield in a practically
zero rate environment with very low or benign credit costs, I mean this is pretty chunky. So we probably would
have expected a little bit more competition that we're seeing. But frankly, we've made it really easy to work with
the dealers. The dealers know what our buy box is. They know we're not inconsistent in that.
And so part of just having established relationships with 19,700 dealers just leads to a really attractive originations
overall and really attractive yields where we're booking. So I'd just say – I don't mean to sound boring. It's just it's
always a competitive market. But there haven't been really any big shifts in the universe in which we play in.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hi Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. I just had a couple of questions. I wanted to ask about the capacity of the current balance sheet to add more
loans. I know you've been growing loans at a nice steady clip. You've got a lot of capital generation. But I'm just
wondering from a liquidity perspective, do you feel like you're optimized for that or is there room to kind of burn
down some of that liquidity to add incremental lending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Betsy, so on your first question resounding yes. And really across all of our lending categories that
you've seen us grow consumer retail auto kind of sequentially for the last several quarters. And you see the
robust cash flow, origination flow, and we're absolutely focused on continuing to grow our retail auto lending.
Lease as well continues to be a strong point and we don't see any sign of that stopping. Ally Lending is really just
getting started. So you saw we almost hit $300 million in originations. We're well on our way to get to a couple
billion in that business. And in short order, we hit our highest level of originations in our direct-to-consumer
mortgage portfolio. So we're well on our way. We kind of hit $8 billion or so in originations this year. It's climbed
up to $10 billion from here on out.
Corporate finance continues to be steady growth engine. We'd expect that to get to about $8 billion. So I mean
across the board, we see opportunities to grow every one of our loan portfolios and that's part of the NII guide. It's
NIM expansion, but it's also growth in the balance sheet and growth across all of our businesses.
And then on liquidity, yeah, the short answer there is yes as well. There's still room to optimize. We're sitting with
excess cash that we plan to burn through, through the growth of our loan portfolios but also through liability
management. You've seen us continue to be proactive. We're at 89% deposit funded, but we think that can go
higher and we're naturally running down our broker deposits as well as FHLB and some unsecured and secured
debt. So, just continuing to take down that cash over time which will help with that NIM trajectory as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hi. Great. Thanks. Looking at the big increase in originations, the biggest is what you call the growth channel
which went from 50% to 53%. So it kind of accounted for, I don't know, well over $2 billion of growth year-over-
year. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is it the partnerships that you've got with some of the newer type
players or any other kind of insights that you can give us there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hey Moshe, it's really all of the above. It's definitely the growing partnerships we have. And we've talked at
length about Carvana. That continues to be a very robust relationship. But there's many others in that category as
well as just focusing on diversified more traditional dealers that have added to that growth channel as well. That's
been a deliberate strategy that we've had to diversify access to applications, diversify our customer base and we
just continue to see really strong success across all types of dealerships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And I'm struck, Jenn, by a comment that you made earlier in your prepared remarks about kind of
taking steps I think given the strong earnings now. And obviously some of these things will moderate and as you
pointed out about the dealer floor plan. Some of them will get better as you go forward. But could you talk a little
bit more you've talked about higher levels of capital return. But can you talk about other steps to optimize whether
it's balance sheet structure or other pieces of the P&L or other types of kind of economies of scale that we could
see generating better sustained returns over time?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I mean I talked a lot about the optimization that we've delivered and we're not done with that, right.
So the conversation we just had on retail auto, we're going to continue to diversify our customer base, continue to
increase access to applications and drive strong originations and risk-adjusted returns. And so kind of the retail
auto story is to be continued and we see a lot more opportunity there in the traditional loan and lease categories.
But also in insurance, smart option, our direct lending platform Clearlane, [indiscernible] (00:59:11). So, a lot of
opportunity to continue to optimize with risk adjusted returns within kind of the four walls of auto and insurance.
And then outside of that we talk a lot about liability optimization. That's been just a terrific growth that we've had in
deposit customers. We've built loyalty with them, strong retention, and we've been able to take down the cost of
funds eight consecutive quarters. And we've got at least that to come in terms of continuing to take down deposit
costs. We have some kind of $20 billion in CDs that are rolling off this year at over 150 basis points. And much of
that's rolling into a 50 basis point OSA product. So a lot of room just kind of within the four walls of deposits to
continue to optimize.
And then there's a mix component here as well as we continue to increase the percent of our liabilities coming
from deposits. So lots there still to come.
And on many of our newer businesses we're just starting to accelerate up the J curve. We're seeing accretive
returns in mortgage. We're getting there quickly in Ally Lending. Invest is going to take some time but we like the
synergies across kind of the Savings and Invest platform. So really just getting started in terms of the optimization
of our newer businesses.
And then Moshe, last but not least on capital deployment, I think what's clearly is as you can see just a robust
trajectory we have ahead from organic growth. And so we don't need to be in hurry to deploy that capital, we can
be patient. We have a great earnings forecast, we will be opportunistic on M&A. And then under the SCB
framework we can continue to look for ways to optimize our capital and our capital deployment.
And with share buybacks, we had a big increase. Based on where I believe our stock price is going we have an
incredibly return from those buybacks. And so we'll continue to look for additional ways to deliver value through a
buyback program.
So hopefully that gives you some color. But in many ways, Moshe, we are just getting started with optimization,
it's obviously a lot completed but a lot more to come.
