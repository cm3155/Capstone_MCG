Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andy Harmening, President and CEO, for opening
remarks. Please go ahead, sir.

Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Hillary, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Andy
Harmening, and I'm joined here today by Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahem, our Chief Credit
Officer.
I'd like to start things off by covering the highlights of the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives.
From there, Chris is going to walk through our updates on income, expense, and capital, and then Pat will follow
up with an update on our credit trends.
So, here in the Upper Midwest, we continue to see signs of a strong economy in our footprint. COVID restrictions
have largely been eased or lifted, and employment trends remain remarkably strong with unemployment rates in
Wisconsin and Minnesota now down below 3%.
We also continue to see encouraging strength in our commercial loan pipelines and utilization rates, giving us
confidence that the momentum we began to see in manufacturing back in the second half of 2021 is, in fact,
carrying over into 2022. Meanwhile, all of our new lending initiatives are now fully – now are now officially up and
running, putting Associated position to deliver more and relevant product solutions to our customers.
While the war in Ukraine, continuing supply chain disruptions and inflation issue post significant question marks at
the macro level, our core customer base has remained resilient and continues to borrow and to grow. This
resilience is seen in the overall credit trends in our loan portfolios which largely continue to improve.
As we continue to transform the bank, one of our biggest opportunities is to listen to our customers and then take
action. Guided by their feedback, we announced that we're making several changes to our overdraft program and
these changes will significantly reduce the financial burden of overdrafts to our customers.
In summary, we have positioned Associated to be in a far better place than we were a year ago. Today, we're in a
strong position to deliver expanding margins, continued positive operating leverage and enhanced value to all of
our stakeholders.
So now, let me touch on the first quarter highlights that are outlined on slide 2. This quarter was marked by
meaningful growth in our core loan portfolios, disciplined expense management, improving credit dynamics, and
strong bottom line results.
Our total loans grew at a 5% annualized rate on both an average and a period-end basis. And excluding PPP,
average commercial and business loans expanded at an even faster 8% annualized pace. This loan growth,
along with our continued investment strategies, helped drive net interest income and margins higher despite
having two fewer days in the quarter.
Now, shifting to expenses. We managed our total expenses down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year while
simultaneously increasing our minimum wage, investing in our technology platforms and investing in our
initiatives. We attribute these savings to the significant actions we took to consolidate our operations and support
functions in the latter half of 2021.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
With respect to credit, we would highlight that we are posting a modest net recovery this quarter. Portfolio metrics
continue to be strong and stable as we keep a close eye on geopolitical and economic risks. Taken together, loan
growth, margin expansion, expense discipline and strong credit drove robust EPS of $0.47 and another quarter of
double-digit returns on capital.
So turning to slide 3, I'd like to provide a little more detail on the loan trends we saw in the quarter. Looking to our
average balances, we had net loan growth across all of our core business segments. Consumer loans grew as
our auto finance vertical kicked into gear and commercial lending grew including our new verticals, more than
offset the headwinds of the mortgage warehouse and PPP. General commercial lending again showed strong
momentum, reflecting broad underlying loan demand [indiscernible] (05:56) customer base.
On slide 4, we'd like to highlight several dynamics which give us confidence in the continuation of the loan trends
we've seen emerging over the past several quarters. First, the left-hand side of this page highlights the emerging
total commercial growth we've experienced. Aside from the dual headwinds of PPP and mortgage warehouse, our
commercial portfolio at March 31 was up 9% year-over-year and expanded at double-digit annualized growth
rates versus the third quarter.
This has largely been fueled by a rebound in commercial C&I balances, growth from our new ABL and equipment
finance initiatives, as well as increased line utilization. And we still see upside and room for more borrowing as the
economic environment continues to normalize.
Now second, on the lower right, we'd also highlight that our back book of unfunded CRE construction projects has
continued to grow. Year-over-year, we've added over $0.5 billion in unfunded commitments, most of which we'd
expect to see funded over the next 18 months. And while the first quarter is seasonally slow for construction in our
markets, we fully expect this activity to pick up as the spring weather arrives in our footprint.
Underscoring the points I just made, I'd like to affirm our full year loan targets on slide 5. With respect to
commercial loans, we expect to end the year with $16 billion of outstandings excluding ABL and equipment
finance, which I'll touch on in a moment. Given the growth that we've seen, the robust pipelines that continue –
have continued to grow since year-end and the funding activity we expect to see this quarter, we're confident
we're on track to hit our commercial loan goals for the year even with the headwind of dampening our mortgage
warehouse activity.
We're also pleased to update you on the strong progress we're driving in our new ABL and equipment finance
verticals. We've strengthened the teams. Both groups have added commitments and outstandings during the
quarter and we feel very confident about the $300 million target we've set for year-end. So taken together, we
expect our total commercial book to end the year at approximately $16.3 billion.
Turning to auto finance, the first quarter demonstrated our team's ability to deliver. We expect this portfolio to
continue to grow strongly and maintain its strong credit profile as we roll out the program to our broader dealer
network and into our core footprints later this year. In summary, despite some uncertainty in the markets and
modest headwinds such as mortgage warehouse, we expect to achieve our lending growth targets in 2022.
Now turning to slide 6. Let me make a few comments with respect to our continued investment in talent, our digital
transformation and our capital priorities. With respect to talent, we've continued to add new relationship and
portfolio managers to our commercial and small business teams during the quarter and are on track to hire 15 to
20 bankers by year-end. We also opened our Houston CRE office during the quarter and continue to ramp up our
ABL and equipment finance teams.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
On the digital front, we crossed a milestone by launching our internal pilot for our new NCR digital platform, which
we plan to roll out to all of our consumer customers this summer. Now, this is one I'm personally very excited
about because it's going to give us an open architecture platform. It's going to allow us to integrate both
customization and fintech solutions.
Turning to capital, we remain committed to optimizing our capital to support our customers. In 2022, that means
focusing squarely on organic growth. We see plenty of loan growth in our outlook and envision using all of our
capital to support that growth while paying a competitive dividend. We continue to see our investments and
strategies as creating a differentiated growth path for Associated that will drive further margin and efficiency gains
in a time where we are already expecting to see significant tailwinds from the rate environment.
So, let me pause there for a moment and hand it over to Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a little
more detail on our revenue and income statement trends for the quarter. Chris?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles

Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 7, net interest income continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter. The
increase came as we put our excess liquidity to work in loans and securities. As we had previously indicated, our
NIM bottomed out last year and has continued to inch higher each quarter since. Given the rising rate
environment, our general asset-sensitive profile and the anticipated impacts of our growth initiatives, we fully
expect our NIM to continue to expand and come in above the 2.5% level, which we already saw during the month
of March.
We now expect short-term interest rates to rise following each of this year's upcoming FOMC meetings. Assuming
those rate increases are 25 basis points, at least following this meeting, we would expect our full-year net interest
income to exceed $840 million.
On slide 8, we highlight that we've purchased securities which have been participating and moved higher in rates,
an effect we've been averaging up into the yields we're earning even as we've reined in durations. Our blended
investment yields for the quarter continue to move higher and our total portfolio yields have improved by nearly 40
basis points since the third quarter. In anticipation of higher rates, we also took steps in Q1 to redesignate $1.6
billion of our securities from AFS to HTM.
Nonetheless, our AOCI does reflect a $127 million reduction in the value of the portfolio during the quarter. This
AOCI impacts net of earnings drove the 18 basis point reduction in our TCE which you can see on our tables. Our
TCE nonetheless ended the quarter at 7.7%.
Moving on to slide 9, we continue to benefit from our strong deposit trends. In a time of year when we might
typically expect to see a post-New Year outflow, average deposits were up $245 million quarter-over-quarter and
up 7% year-over-year.
Growth continues to be concentrated in our low-cost deposit categories, such as our savings and interest-bearing
demand accounts for consumers. With rates expected to rise throughout the year, we may see some outflows
later in the year and would expect deposit pricing to heat up at some point. But so far, we have not seen
customers reduce balances and we're not seeing competitive pressure to raise rates in our markets.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Moving on to slide 10. Our core fee-based revenues came in modestly ahead of last year's comparable quarters.
Total non-interest revenues did not improve year-over-year with notable reductions in mortgage banking revenue,
asset gains, and branch sales, as well as slightly reduced [indiscernible] (13:12) income.
With the expectation for continued rising rates, we see mortgage banking revenue further moderating as we move
through the year. We also expect that higher rates will ultimately translate into higher earning credit rates for
some commercial deposit customers which will have the effect of dampening commercial deposit fees later in the
year.
As Andy mentioned, we also announced several changes to our OD/NSF programs today that will impact our run
rate for fees beginning the third quarter. While these changes are intended to reduce the burden on our
customers, they will also reduce our deposit service charge revenues by approximately $3 million in 2022. Given
our outlook for higher rates and the revised expectations of lower service charges revenue from both commercial
and consumer customers over the back half of the year, we are therefore modifying our full-year non-interest
income guidance moderately downward. We would now expect total non-interest income for the full year of
between $290 million and $300 million.
Moving on to slide 11. First quarter expenses came in at $173 million, $9 million lower than Q4 amid reduced
personnel and other expenses. In alignment with the strategic initiatives we announced last fall, we do expect to
scale up investments in areas such as technology and personnel later in the year. But as we continue to execute
our plans, we remain committed to maintaining our expense growth in line with the revenue and the revenue
expectations. Taking all of our initiatives in consideration, we continue to expect our full year 2022 non-interest
expense will be in the range of $725 million to $740 million.
On slide 12, we provided a walk forward of our quarterly pre-tax pre-provision income from the fourth quarter of
2021 to Q1 of 2022. While our non-interest income was down from the prior quarter, our pre-tax pre-provision
income grew by $3 million quarter-to-quarter despite having two fewer days in the period. We estimate our daily
interest accrual benefit at about $1 million per day.
Slide 13 shows the fourth quarter trend of our PTPP income. As you'll recall, we had stated back in July that we
expected pre-tax pre-provision to consistently come in above the $78 million baseline we said in Q2. I'm pleased
to confirm that we've delivered on that and held to that statement over the past three quarters. Furthermore, we
expect PTPP to continue to trend higher as we expand our operating leverage throughout 2022 and into 2023.
Moving on to slide 14, we remain disciplined from a capital perspective and continue to drive our capital ratios
towards their targets as we continue to grow loans on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, the AOCI
impact we realized in our securities book was a key driver of our decrease in the TCE quarter-over-quarter. So,
thanks to strong earnings and the redesignation actions we took in the quarter, our tangible book value per share
only decreased 3%. We will continue to target TCE levels of 7.5% and CET1 levels of 9.5%.
I'll now turn it over to Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer, for a credit quality update.

Thanks, Chris. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 15. We utilized the
Moody's February 2022 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline
forecast remains consistent and assumes additional fiscal support, a continued relatively low interest rate
environment, the recent acceleration in consumer prices to be transitory and relatively localized COVID cases.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Following net reserve releases in all four quarters of 2021, we posted another negative provision in Q1 of 2022
and saw net recoveries as opposed to net charge-offs during the quarter. Our ACLL as of March 31 was $318
million, down from $320 million at year-end. During Q1, the reduction in ACLL was driven primarily by a $6 million
reduction in oil and gas as that portfolio continues to run off. Our ratio of reserves to loans declined slightly to
1.3% from 1.22% during the quarter.
Turning to slide 16, we highlight our quarterly credit trends. As Andy mentioned, most of our key credit metrics
continued to improve over the course of the quarter. Non-accrual loans did pick up slightly quarter-over-quarter
with the increase tied to one specific credit.
Nonetheless, total non-accruals were down 12% year-over-year. While in total, restructured loans and
delinquencies have fluctuated over the past five quarters, they have now decreased 26% quarter-over-quarter
and have decreased by $13 million versus Q1 of 2021. Going forward, we expect to adjust provision to reflect
changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes and other indications of credit quality.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. So on slide 17, we recap our full year guidance for 2022. Over the remainder of 2022, we remain
bullish about loan growth. Specifically, we continue to expect full year auto finance loan growth of over $1.2 billion
and total commercial loan growth of $750 million to $1 billion.
In our forecast, we had anticipated a 25 basis point increase at each FOMC meeting this year. And accordingly,
we expect our full year 2022 net interest income to exceed $840 million. Given this revised rate outlook, we are
also modifying our fee income guidance to account for lower mortgage banking and service charge revenue
throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect total non-interest income to be between $290
million and $300 million for the full year. And then taken together, we now expect the combined total of net
interest and fee income to exceed $1.135 billion. Lastly, our commitment to expense discipline remains a focus,
and we continue to expect between $725 million and $740 million of non-interest expense in 2022.
So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]
Our first question is from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Chris, maybe for – hey. First question for you. The $40 million favorable delta in the NII guidance, so is that
completely due to the higher rate expectation or are there any other nuances in there? I'm guessing it's mostly
due to rates given no change to the loan growth or securities portfolio outlooks but just curious to hear your
thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, it's rate-driven. We've been monitoring spreads. And I think that reflects our expectations around rates and
their impact on spreads and deposit betas which we've continued to get comfort in as we've gone through the
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And I think last quarter, you alluded to sort of a $1.5 million per month benefit from each Fed rate hike. Is
that still a good rule of thumb in your mind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So, we would say that the $840 million incorporates the early benefit of the first [ph] $25 million (21:34) and the
marginal above and beyond that, it's probably a little tampered down, so about $1 million per month for any rate
rise above [ph] $25 million (21:46). So for example, I'll be a little more specific than I was last time. If there's 50
basis points in May, we would see the bps that that benefits start to show up in June. And so you'd have seven
months of additional $1 million benefit to the extent there's 50 basis points in May for example. So the $840
million would be $847-ish million.

Okay. Perfect. And then I guess final question, how are you thinking about overall balance sheet growth
specifically earning asset growth for the full year? I guess another way of asking, sort of, deposit flow
expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So we have seen our deposits remain remarkably resilient. And so the balance sheet is going to be driven
by the asset growth from our perspective. And we're reaffirming all of the asset growth numbers here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Operator: Our next question is from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe just following up on the deposit question, I
appreciate the comments that 1Q is typically seasonally weaker and held up better this go around. Just given kind
of the liquidity that you still have in your balance sheet, the loan and deposit ratio, to the extent that there are
incremental outflows here in the second quarter which we have seen in the past, are you okay just kind of letting
those flow through and having the loan and deposit ratio tick up higher? Or is there an expectation that you'll kind
of offset those exiting deposits with either brokered money or wholesale funding?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, this is Andy. And, of course, we always have the option of funding it on the wholesale market. What I would
say is that we're in a pretty good position from a core funding standpoint today. But if you look at some of the
initiatives we've talked about, our commercial bankers, our business bankers, we've added, since I got here,
roughly 22% increase in relationship managers. Those folks don't do just loans. They're in our core markets and
they will start to drive our deposit strategies.
We're also launching a mass affluent strategy, and I can tell you that I see the index of our mass affluent
customers. And in a consumer bank, they make up 70% of the deposits. We're under-indexed in the amount we
have from each of those. This will be the third time I've launched this type of strategy at a bank and I know what to
expect. We will see additional growth at the tail end of the year going into the next year.
We're a top 20 HSA provider. That is a very deposit-heavy business. We have the infrastructure and we'll
continue to invest in that. We'll invest in our digital account opening. We'll invest in our branch account opening.
So some of the things we haven't talked as much about will directly relate to how we fund our core deposits over
time.

So to answer the question, we do feel like we have sufficient liquidity from different sources, but we're also
making sure we are prepared from a balance sheet standpoint from both the loan side and deposit side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the loan side, I guess how much of an expected remaining
headwind is there out of the mortgage warehouse portfolio? And I'm assuming as that stabilizes, as PPP
becomes less of an issue, these new initiatives are going to result in faster kind of balance sheet and loan growth.
Is there another leg lower in the second quarter for warehouse and then we really start to see loan growth
accelerate in the back end of the year, or do you think that much of the warehouse reduction has already been
addressed here in the first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So I think you're hitting the nail on the head a little bit there. We don't expect the year-end balances to be
much different than what we forecasted. We just expect this – we just – we have seen that more quickly with the
ramp up in rates. So we still expect a modest decrease in mortgage warehouse the rest of the year, but not at the
rate that we saw in the first quarter. As you add RMs and as you mature these initiatives, we expect -- our pipeline
is the highest we've seen in six months. So we expect that to follow through and pull through to the balance sheet.
So, yes, there'll be a slight dampening and that's why I use the term modest on purpose. We'll see a modest
dampening of mortgage warehouse where it was much more significant in the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last for me, on the expenses, great to see the expense control in the first quarter. And I
guess, I'm a little bit surprised that with it didn't come a reduction in full-year guidance. I know you talked about
some personnel spend and technology spend in the back end of the year but I mean how much of that is more so
you guys being conservative on that front versus kind of planned dollars in the pipeline that you have visibility to
coming in the remainder of the year that's going to drive expenses kind of to that guided level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Great question. I'm going to take your first comment as a – I'm going to say thank you for the kudos on
expense management. And what I would say is, look, this is a growth story. And as we grow, we have to invest to
grow. And so, we expect as we go through the year, we're going to add another 20% on the RM side. That will set
us up not for this year because the folks we've already hired have set us up for this year, that'll set us up for the
end of the year heading into next year. So we want to continue to fuel this and we expect as we put out in our
strategic initiatives that we expect positive operating leverage which we are achieving and we believe will achieve
throughout the year. And so in order to do that, you have to reinvest in the business. And so we see that steady
growth, but we'll control that investment to make sure it lines up with our revenue growth.

Maybe big picture question for Andy. A lot of what you've done has been on the lending side and I guess deposits
which you highlighted as well. What are your thoughts on adding to the fee income businesses? When I look at
your 2022 outlook, it's about 25% fee income, which my gut tells me that is a bit light versus some peers. So do
you have any kind of bigger picture plans on expanding fee businesses once these lending platforms are up and
running?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's a good question. I'll say a couple of things. One, the Mass Affluent strategy in order to be a good wealth
bank, a really good wealth bank, having the Mass Affluent piece in place is really important. What happens is you
have the initial conversation with people that are switchers that move money. Those folks that are in the Mass
Affluent bucket which is $250,000 to $1 million, they grow into wealth customers and you upstream those folks.
So as we launch the Mass Affluent, our expectation is we will rebrand our wealth business. We will have a digital
road map for wealth that aligns with the conversations we're having. And then, ultimately, we'll start to feed that
business. But getting the Mass Affluent first is important for us. We'll have a focus on the commercial business
which we do believe can drive some additional fees whether that'd be treasury management or capital markets.
But that is just getting started for us.
So, Terry, I think your observation is right. There is a lot on the margin side of this. And over time, we believe that
we can build the capabilities some organically on the fee income side of that through wealth and commercial
banking.

Thanks for that. And then maybe my follow-up for Chris is about a $2 million increase in quarter-over-quarter
mortgage, is that a function of earlier in the year adopting kind of fair value of your MSR and just seeing that asset
worth more value more today than three months ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So, if I look at them, yeah, the short answer to your question is, yes. Just so that we're on the same page,
mortgage banking net was only up modestly, $300,000 quarter-over-quarter, but the lift for the quarter was all
driven by looking at how we adopted fair value. And it came in as we expected, but was a contributor to the lift.
Yes.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Really it's been a good story on the credit quality front. We've had a few issues there, but just the non-accrual that
you mentioned, it looks like it was a commercial real estate non-accrual in the quarter. If there's any other detail
around industry or anything like that that you could provide I'd be interested. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
No. As we mentioned, it was really one specific credit, given some events around that, we feel confident that
we're not going to see a long-term loss there, but we'll continue to watch it. In terms of what we're seeing in
commercial real estate space, it's been pretty resilient. As with anyone else, we're watching the CRE office asset
class. We feel pretty good about how we've been pretty conservative underwriting that asset class over the
historical period. But we're always monitoring and doing probably further deep dives than we had in the past just
given the shifts coming out of COVID and how tenants are going to start using their space.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then the NSF fees that are going to be coming out, is that – just a modeling question,
the $3 million, is that literally just $1.5 million a quarter? Is that going to be started later in the third quarter or is
that just July 1 from a time perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think – this is Andy – from a modeling perspective, we expect that $3 million is really a half-year impact.
So doubling that up, our annualized impact is about $6 million. So it is roughly $1.5 million a quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris McGratty of KBW. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Maybe a question for Chris. Last cycle, you guys – you've made some efforts to reduce the
network deposits and those dollars have come down. I guess where could you be surprised in your deposit base?
We saw some of your peers have some chunky movements this quarter. You obviously didn't. But where could
you be surprised?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I'll go with Andy's approach. Thank you for the kudos on the management that we did here over the last
couple of years to make sure that when the rates started to turn again, we wouldn't be in a position of being
surprised. And so I'd say we worked hard to make sure that wasn't the dynamics. As you point out and as we
show on our tables, the entire amount of network deposit was down to $760 million, and that number was close to
$4 billion at one point in time, so dramatic role reversing that.
Where we, I think, were most concerned is the significant uplift in non-interest-bearing. And so the non-interest-
bearing is up to $8.3 billion, which is a remarkable and wonderful thing. And if you would ask me, which Andy did,
what's going to happen in the first quarter, the answer was, well, they're going to flow out. And they didn't. And if
you'd ask me what's going to happen after April 18, [ph] this year's tax day (34:19), I would have said, well, we'll

see a downtick, and we haven't. And so the reality is they're proving to be a lot stickier than I would have
expected. And that's been a positive, but that's the biggest risk. But so far, knocking on wood here, we just
haven't seen it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Thanks, Chris. Maybe a second one on just pricing for the auto business, can you just
remind us what part of the curve is priced off, how has spreads and pricing held up given competition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So on page 6 of the press release tables, we break out the yield for the auto finance portfolio which for the
quarter came in at 3.52%. I haven't looked at everyone's results on that basis, but Andy did have me look at a
bank based in Ohio that has a big auto book, and I noticed that our yields are about 14 basis points higher than
theirs. So I guess we're in sync.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. On slide 3, when you're going through your prepared comments, Andy, you made a comment about
construction lending. And I missed a part of it, and I think I understood what you're saying, but can you go through
that again in terms of what you're seeing on your backlog?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I mean, the crux of it is our unfunded commitments continue to grow on the construction side. So clearly,
our belief is as we get into heavier construction season, we have an opportunity for growth. So we've put on
roughly a $500 million increase year-over-year in commercial construction, CRE construction. So what we're

saying is we believe that will serve as a tailwind for growth for us the rest of this year. And really, the expectation
is that does fund that entire amount over roughly an 18-month period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay, good. The other question I had is kind of nuanced, but the general commercial, your averages were
up about to [ph] 240 (36:40), but period end, it was up about [ph] 40 (36:43). What's the subtlety there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I know it's sometimes different to compare the average to period end, I'm just curious to know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I think if you look on page 3, you can see it's not that subtle. It's mortgage warehouse. That's the biggest
part of it. That's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
General commercial, general commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. What we had done on there is we've shown kind of the fourth quarter combined with the first quarter
because we had a very big fourth quarter in commercial and so that dampened a little. We pulled forward some of
those deals. They happened to close pretty quickly.
The non-subtlety that you can't see is we have our highest pipeline in the last six months. So we've been able to
refill that during the first quarter, so a little bit of accelerated, I'll hit it once, drain that a little, build it back up to
where it was and then some significantly above there. So that's what's giving us confidence in the growth as we
see the general C&I on the go-forward basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. And then maybe more philosophical on the change in overdrafts, I think we all understand what the
bigger banks are doing on it. I'm just curious if you can gain from this. I know there's a loss that we talk about

financially, but can you gain from this relative to some of your other competitors that may not be waiving overdraft
fees to your small and medium sized competitors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It's hard to predict what their actions are going to be in the future. But when you do things that are in a customers'
favor and you do it willingly, that usually serves as a positive when it comes to satisfaction. So our expectation is
that as they see this, there's only a positive response to this. I'm particularly pleased with the NSF fee that will go
away as that – those NSF fees are overdrafts that aren't paid. So to know that goes away, I really like that one in
particular, although all of them are in the customers' favor. So my answer probably can't be relative to others
because that's a fluid situation. But I do expect a positive response from our own customer base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Last one, Pat, for you, anything you're wary of if we do get Fed funds at 200 basis points by the end
of the year, anything that makes you nervous about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No. Not really. We're sizing all of our upfront underwriting to – we're sensitizing interest rates. We're looking out
kind of especially in the real estate book, the commercial real estate book to an exit. So we're building a lot of that
stuff into our underwriting. It hasn't happened the last couple of years. We might start to see it now. But right now,
like I said, the book overall is doing very well. The one item we're watching like everyone else is just the office.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thank you for taking the question. Jon took a couple of mine, but I did want to take another crack at the
higher rates sort of question. And just as we move later in this year and we are at higher levels of absolute rates,
is there any interest in maybe turning back on or putting some mortgage on the balance sheet at kind of higher
interest rates or is that still kind of really in runoff even once we reach those levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I would say we're not really in runoff. What we say is, balance will be relatively stable. And so clearly, mortgage
rates in the high-4s and even 5s are relatively attractive, but so is a growing commercial book and so is our auto

book. And so I think we've got focus on growth, but we won't turn blind eyes to opportunities. And what we might
say is if I can put on a mortgage at 4% or a security at 3%, sometimes the mortgage looks better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got you. And then my follow-up question was actually just on auto, obviously it's been performing well thus far,
but consumers are starting to feel a little bit more of a pinch. Are you guys seeing any early signs or anything that
you're monitoring more closely now just kind of with the inflation backdrop and the squeeze on some consumers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It's an interesting question of who's feeling the pinch and what that means. And what we're hearing and seeing is
the subprime market is feeling the pinch and maybe those delinquencies are at a level that may be similar to pre-
pandemic. We virtually don't have that in our portfolio, so we're not seeing that.
The second thing is general consumer is fairly healthy relative to where they entered the crisis from a average
liquidity position. So the answer is the consumer is fairly healthy in the segments that we're lending to. We have
not seen anything. And we won't have a blind eye to that with inflation at the levels that we have and the actions
that are being taken, having geopolitical conflict. But we like the way that we're lending into a very prime, super
prime customer.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. It's Timur again. Just one more follow-up on auto. The implied balance for year-end kind of suggests a
similar growth rate to what we've seen here in the first quarter. I'm just wondering, as you continue to roll out that
product set to the rest of your footprint, does that growth accelerate? Is there something that you're going to be
doing on your end to kind of limit that growth to that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion by year-end? I would just love to hear
your comments on the trajectory of the expected growth rate in auto.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So this is Andy. I'll take that one. And the way that I would answer that is while I like the auto vertical, we
don't want to be just an auto bank. We want to be lending across the spectrum and using our capital for
commercial, for business banking, for ABL, for equipment finance, for auto.

I also want to make sure that we're operationally solid and strong as we go through this. So we don't – I don't feel
I need to put too much pressure on this machine. To me, $1.2 billion in growth is a strong year. And so if we are
getting returns, if we are operationally strong, if we believe that it fits within the capital usage of all the other
pieces of that, that will bear out what our decision is.
But as it goes right now, with the pipelines that we're seeing in commercial and the successful launch of multiple
initiatives, the successful hiring of talented RMs on the commercial side, I really like the balance that we're getting
right now. I very much want to get into footprints. I actually think that with our brand name and our recognition, it's
actually a product. While it's indirect, it actually can translate on the direct side for our customer base. And so
that's probably where our focus is. And I don't feel the need to come out and modify the forecast on that for the
sake of volume.
