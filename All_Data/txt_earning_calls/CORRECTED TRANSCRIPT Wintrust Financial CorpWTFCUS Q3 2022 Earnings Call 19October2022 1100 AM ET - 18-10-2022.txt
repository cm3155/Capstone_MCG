Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you very much. Welcome, everybody, to our third quarter earnings call. With me are Dave Dykstra, Dave
Stoehr, Kate Boege, our General Counsel, Tim Crane, and Rich Murphy. As the same format as usual, I'll give
some general comments regarding our results, turn over to Tim Crane who'll do detail on the balance sheet and
the margin, Dave Dykstra then will discuss other income and other expense in detail, Rich probably will then
discuss credit, back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future. Then, as always, time for
questions.
First of all, I will tell you, I did survive my back surgery, was out a couple of months which probably – or a couple
of weeks which is probably the reason for the numbers being as good as they are this quarter. But all is well here.
And the [indiscernible] (02:34) has been greatly exaggerated. So, I'm back in the saddle.
For the quarter, income of $143 million, up 51% for second quarter; diluted earnings per share of $2.21 up 48%
from the previous quarter. On a pre-tax, pre-provision basis, I think, it's a record for us, $206 million. Our net
interest margin at 3.35% is moving up nicely. The beach ball is coming out. Somewhere that the beach ball might
be suffering from the bends going so fast. So, keep an eye on that, though.
Return on assets 1.12%. Return on equity 12.31%. Return on tangible equity 15%. Net overhead ratio is up a little
bit, but we expected our overall [indiscernible] (03:32) year-to-date is 1.35%, but 1.53% this quarter, as Dave will
discuss, we had [indiscernible] (03:40) compensation because of how other quarters going. Let's see.
Credit front, Rich probably will talk about that. But we did have one large credit come in. Basically, that took up a
lot of the – makes up a lot of the – more all of the increase really. But we did have a couple of bigger ones roll off,
too, but we think that's adequate coverage, Rich will talk about that.
Assets, we closed at $52.4 billion. Loans were up $1 billion or more up $750 million. When you think of average
versus quarter-end, we started this quarter with a nice head start. And I mean, it was good going forward in that –
from that – in that regard.
Deposits are up $204 million. We need to start pushing deposits very hard to keep up with our loan growth. We've
got a lot of ideas there, and they are being instituted as we speak for our lower-cost deposits to come in.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Tim. Take it away.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Ed. A couple of balance sheet items and then several items of interest, including the continued
impact of rising rates on margin expectations.
Ed mentioned the $1.1 billion of loan growth. That's 12% annualized. And importantly, it's spread nicely across all
loan categories. In addition, the period-end loan balances, Ed also mentioned, $735 million higher than the
quarter average which will help our fourth quarter results. We're encouraged by stable loan pipelines. We believe
that loan growth in the mid- to high-single digits on an annualized basis remains a reasonable expectation given
the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
The $200 million worth of deposit growth affected by the rapid rise in rates, combined with Fed balance sheet
actions, is making deposit gathering more challenging and the cost of deposits are rising. Interest-bearing deposit
costs of 64 basis points for the quarter were up 36 basis points and will continue to trend up. We obviously
anticipate continued increases in both the Fed funds rate and the rate associated with the bank's loan and deposit
activities. Increases in loan yields at this point of the cycle continue to exceed the change in deposit costs given
our asset-sensitive position.
Our deposit betas and the increase in deposit costs to-date are in line with our expectations. We anticipate an
interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 40% over the full cycle and are currently operating below that level.
Our securities book remained essentially unchanged in the quarter. At quarter end, liquidity remains strong with
approximately $4 billion of interest-bearing cash on the balance sheet.
Early in the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $1 billion of the excess liquidity in the higher yielding
securities with attractive spreads. As we discussed last quarter, our securities book is approximately 47%
available for sale and 53% held to maturity. During the quarter, the rise in interest rates resulted in an additional
tax-adjusted unrealized loss of approximately $142 million on the AFS securities.
While that's material, the tangible book value of $58.42 remains stable compared to this time last year. With
respect to rate sensitivity in the margin, first, although our GAAP position is down slightly, we remain asset-
sensitive and well-positioned to benefit from continued rising rates. As a reminder, and this is outlined on page 7
of the presentation, approximately 80% by dollars of our loans reprice or mature within a year.
Second, as we experience increasing rates, we continue to believe each 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds
rate will generate approximately $40 million in pre-tax net interest income on an annualized basis. To be more
specific on the margin, Ed mentioned the 3.35%, that was up 42 basis points for the quarter. With rates rising
rapidly, we've exceeded the margin improvement that we've discussed or projected on prior calls. At this point,
depending mostly on the impact of competition for deposits, we believe a margin in excess of 3.70% is possible
for the fourth quarter, with the margin approaching 4% at some point during the first quarter also depending on
the pace and magnitude of Fed funds increases.
Perhaps worth noting, during the quarter, the bank entered into several interest rate collars. These collars with
terms between three and five years essentially provide some margin protection in the event that rates fall again to
very low levels. For the quarter, capital ratios were stable to down slightly but remain appropriate given our risk
profile. And as we also discussed last quarter with higher rates and more typical loan growth, the company's
earnings are projected to result in organic improvement to capital levels in the coming quarters. Overall, a pretty
clean quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All right. Thanks, Tim. I'll cover the noteworthy income statement categories, starting with net interest income. For
the third quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $401.4 million. That was an increase of $63.6 million as
compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $114 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021. The $63.6
million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in the net
interest margin and loan growth.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
The net interest margin, as and Tim referred to, improved 42 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%. The
beneficial increase of 67 basis points on the yield on earning assets and a 12 basis point increase in the net free
funds contribution combined with a 37 basis point increase for the rates paid on liability resulted in the improved
margin. The increase in the yield on earning assets in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was
primarily due to a 69 basis point improvement on loan yields and a higher liquidity management asset yield as the
company earned higher short-term rates on interest-bearing deposits held at banks. The increase in the rate paid
on interest-bearing liabilities in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was driven by a 36 basis point
increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.
Turning to provision for credit losses. Wintrust recorded provision for credit losses of $6.4 million compared to
provision of $20.4 million in the prior quarter and the $7.9 million negative provision recorded in the year ago
quarter. The provision expense was lower in the third quarter, partly as a result of providing for strong but lower
loan growth compared to the second quarter, a lower level of net charge-offs and improvement in the mix of
classified loans, and that was offset slightly by changes in various macroeconomic factors. Rich Murphy will cover
credit, which continues to be good and additional detail in just a few minutes.
Turning to non-interest income and non-interest expenses. In the non-interest income section, our wealth
management revenue was up $1.8 million to $33.1 million from $31.4 million on the prior quarter and up from
$31.5 million recorded in the year ago quarter. Given the volatile market conditions, we're pleased with that result,
which was aided by strong activity in our 1031 exchange business.
Consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of higher home mortgage rates, our mortgage banking
operations saw the anticipated lower loan origination volume during the third quarter. As such, mortgage banking
revenues decreased by $6.1 million from the second quarter of 2022. And looking forward on our current pipeline
activities, we expect mortgage origination volumes to be lower in the fourth quarter than we just experienced in
the third quarter due to the higher rate environment and seasonal purchasing trends. However, the impact of any
such decline on net earnings is expected to be small and very small relative to the anticipated growth in net
interest income.
The company recorded net losses on investment securities of $3.1 million during the third quarter compared to
net losses of $7.8 million in the prior quarter, as the market decline in equity valuations continued to affect a
portion of our securities portfolio.
Other non-interest income totaled $15.9 million in the third quarter, which was up $2 million from the amount
recorded in the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase in this category is that the company recorded
$2.5 million of losses in the second quarter of this year, associated with the sale and anticipated sale of two
properties, which did not obviously occur again in this quarter. Additionally, the company realized $1.3 million of
lower swap fee revenue in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter.
On the non-interest expense side of the house, the non-interest expenses totaled $296.5 million in the third
quarter and were up 3% or approximately $7.8 million when compared to the prior quarter total of $288.7 million.
The primary reason for the increase was due to higher compensation related expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to approximately $8.8 million in the third quarter as compared
to the second quarter, and relative to the prior quarter, the increase related to $5 million of higher salary expense
and $4.3 million of increased accruals associated with our incentive compensation program. The higher salary
expense was primarily caused by mid-year compensation increases, which included the effect of rates in the
company's minimum wage in August of this year.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
The increase in the commissions and incentive compensation expense was due to higher accruals for both long-
term and short-term incentive compensation programs relative to the prior quarter, and this was really associated
with the increase on the company's profitability and that effect upon the plan design. These increases were offset
somewhat by lower level of mortgage banking commissions due to declining mortgage loan origination volume.
Other than those categories I just discussed, all other expense categories taken together were well controlled and
were actually down by approximately $1 million compared to the second quarter. The decrease was impacted by
a variety of relatively normal operational fluctuations, none that I think are worth noting for this call.
As Ed mentioned, the net overhead ratio, a measure of operational efficiency, stood at 1.53% for the third quarter,
which was relatively stable when compared to the ratio of 1.51% in the prior quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the
net overhead ratio stood at 1.35%. Additionally, the company's efficiency ratio declined below 60% to 58.4% in
the third quarter as expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenue.
So, in summary, the core fundamentals were strong, strong loan growth, expanding margins, solid pipelines, good
credit quality metrics, and I think we're set up good for the future quarters. So, with that, I'll conclude my
comments and turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance for the third quarter was very solid from a number of
perspectives. As detailed on slide 7 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 12% annualized,
an outstanding result. And similar to the past few quarters, we continue to see loan growth across the portfolio.
Specifically, life insurance premium finance continued to see very solid growth as balances increased $396
million. Commercial premium finance also had a very strong quarter with loans of $172 million. C&I loans
increased by $212 million, and commercial real estate grew by $171 million. Year-over-year, we saw total loan
growth of approximately $6 billion or 18% net of PPP loans.
As noted on prior earnings calls, we continued to see very solid momentum in our core C&I and CRE portfolios.
Pipelines have been very strong throughout the year, and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings
during the past several quarters. In addition, disruptions within the competitive banking landscape continue to
work to our benefit.
We continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the remainder of 2022 and early 2023 for a number of reasons.
Core pipelines continue to be very strong through Q3 with solid momentum going into Q4. Commercial line
utilization, excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines as detailed on slide 16, continue to trend up, and we
anticipate this trend will continue.
Also on slide 16, you will see that business expansion and inflation pressures have resulted in many customers
requesting increases to their credit facilities to help finance these costs. And both First Insurance Funding and
Wintrust Life Finance had another impressive quarter. This momentum has been strong for several quarters, and
we believe it should continue into 2023.
As a result, while we acknowledge increased concerns about possible recession, we believe our diversified
portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid- to high-
single digits and maintain our credit discipline.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 15, we continue to see strong credit performance across
the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Non-performing loans increased from $72 million or 20
basis points to $98 million or 26 basis points, roughly the same level we experienced at the end of Q3 2021,
where NPLs were $90 million or 27 basis points.
The increase in NPLs during the quarter came from two factors. One loan, totaling $25 million, within our
franchise finance portfolio moved to non-performing status. This loan had been [indiscernible] (17:45) for some
time as the borrower experienced challenges from extended COVID-19 shutdowns and, more recently, by rising
wage and commodity cost. While these factors have affected other restaurant operators within our portfolio, we
believe this situation is isolated and our franchise finance customers continue to perform well.
Also, we experienced a $10 million increase in NPLs in our commercial premium finance portfolio resulting from a
handful of loans over 90 days past due at quarter end. We are secured on these loans and anticipate repayment
for the unearned premium shortly.
Overall, NPLs continue to be at very low levels and we are still confident about the solid credit metrics of the
portfolio. Charge-offs for the quarter were $3.2 million or 3 basis points down from the previous quarter. Year-to-
date charge-offs totaled $15 million or 6 basis points. Finally, as detailed on slide 15, we saw significant
improvement in our special mention substandard loans with no meaningful signs of economic stress at the
customer level.
That concludes my comments on credit. And I'll turn it back to Ed to wrap up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich. All in all, I think the future is very bright for us. Notwithstanding what could happen in the markets,
et cetera, I mean, those are black swan that jumps in some place, but I like where we sit right now. We should
see continued margin improvement as previous rate increases work their way through our balance sheet and
income statement. The additional rate increases should also benefit our earnings going forward.
As we mentioned, we have begun to earn in some hedges to predict the downside of rates go down very quickly.
Credit remains stellar and loan demand remains good across the board, not sacrifice to a normal conservative
credit standards and are making sure we get paid for the risk.
We continue to benefit from market disruption. The acquisition market continue to remain slow [indiscernible]
(00:19:41). We are looking, as normal, for opportunities in all our businesses. Dilution is still a four-letter word for
us, but I think that, sooner or later, people are going to have to start thinking about where they're going to end up,
and we're the right guys for a lot of people.
Wealth management is doing well because of the CDEC. The diversified nature of our earnings in that, in the
wealth management is serving us well. As the market turns, wealth management should do extremely well. I really
like where we stand. As always, you can be sure of best efforts, and we appreciate your support.
Now we can do some questions. Thank you very much.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good you sound good. Can you guys talk a little bit about the comment where you talked about some deposit
strategies to have funding grow along with loan growth? It's been a struggle for some of your peers, but just
curious what you're thinking on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Tim, I'll let you answer that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon. We grew deposits less than we normally would in the quarter. It's obviously become more price
sensitive in the market, but we continue to add relationships. The disruption will continue to help us. We're
working on kind of some more niche deposit-related activities that we think might bear some fruit.
But we're currently at 89% loan-to-deposit, which is well within our target range. We've got ample liquidity and
could fund several more quarters of unbalanced growth, if we get it. If loan growth proves to be strong after that,
which would probably be really good news, we'd be funding those loans at closer to the higher market marginal
rates. But our intent is to grow deposits, and more importantly, grow relationships and the disruption's helping us.
We're encouraged to-date that the percentage of deposits that are not interest-bearing have stayed pretty stable
at about a-third of deposits. And now, we're off to a good start in the fourth quarter.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. That's helpful. And I guess the other side of the balance sheet, too, maybe this is one for you, Dave.
But you talked about putting some of the cash to work and having a plan to do more of that. Can you talk a little
bit more about what you're doing there and give us an idea of what you did during the quarter and what kind of
yields you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, as we stated in the press release, we put about $1 billion of the liquidity to work in the fourth
quarter. Those were invested in mortgage-backed securities. I don't recall the exact to the basis point yield, but it
was in a 5.5% sort of range. So, we've added some securities. We didn't do any really in the third quarter. We
stayed relatively flat as far as growth goes for investments. But we did have some additional Federal Home Loan
Bank funding where we locked in some lower rates. And basically, you're getting a spread on those that would be
accretive to our ROA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes, going forward – I guess, going forward, Jon, maybe what you're asking is beyond that, do we expect to
invest a lot in securities? And I think the answer probably is not a lot because we have good loan demand. So for
us, we're going to fund a loan demand and use that liquidity to do that. And so, I would expect that the securities
aren't going to grow dramatically from here going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We run 85% to 90% loan to deposits. So, [ph] on your growth (23:39), you're going to have something going into
securities going forward.

Please stick with it. Just on the lending side, I know it sounds like your pipeline is still very good, and you guys are
anxious and have an appetite to continue to lend. But are there any segments that you may be pulling back on at
this point that may seem a little bit more risky than others?

Rich?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, as Ed has always said, our loan policies are – we keep them very conservative. We don't change it.
We don't – as I always say, we don't like to jerk the wheel, and pull in and out of different categories. But I would
think one of the areas that would be probably impacted the most would be CRE. As rates go up, it just makes it
tougher and tougher to have these projects that we're looking at underwriting. It just requires more and more
equity.
So, it'll be interesting to see how that goes. And clearly, in the past, as you know it, David, we – in the CRE space,
we already have a number of years ago really worked our appetite down for retail. I'd say office is another area
that we are focused on pretty dramatically. But overall, we're still seeing good demand in multifamily and in
industrial, although, again, I think it's going to start to feel some of the challenges here of higher borrowing costs.
So – but generally speaking, we're still feeling pretty good about the other areas. I think premium finance will
continue to do very well through next year. C&I demand, as we talked about with what's going on in the
competitive landscape in Chicago, I think we continue to be a really good opportunity for borrowers and
customers bringing over their relationships. But that would be the only area that would jump out at me as being
heavily affected and something that is we're focusing on pretty consistently.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. No, I do recall the rope-a-dope strategy in the commercial real estate way back when, so cool, thanks for
that answer.
And then Texas Capital announced they're selling their premium finance business to Truist during the quarter.
And just within your own premium finance business, can you talk about whether that is a good opportunity for you
guys to gain some market share or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes. Dave, this is Dave Dykstra, right. I think, generally, we think that if you lose a competitor in the space, that's
good for us. And so I think generally people thought in the P&C space the four big players to be a private
company out of Kansas City, Truist, us, and Texas Capital. So if Texas Capital sells to Truist, you now have one
less competitor in that group of four. So I think, generally, that's a positive for us.
Number of our agents and brokers want multiple premium finance providers. And so if, for instance, they were
using Texas Capital and Truist, then they're going to have to find another provider and we would be a likely
candidate for that. And then to a certain extent, Truist has also got an insurance agent and broker business. And
some of our agents and brokers don't like to direct business to a competitor. So we think marginally that helps us
a little bit too, since we are not in the insurance brokerage business. So we don't represent that competition
against some of our clients. So, generally speaking, I mean, it's a competitive industry. You got to fight for every
client. But we think it should be a positive just because of one less competitor in the marketplace.

[indiscernible] (28:37) on the mortgage outlook from here. Obviously, some compression on the gain on sale
margin here in the third quarter. So, Dave, maybe just curious how you're kind of thinking about that margin going
forward despite of all the adjustments and corrections that are going on in that industry today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, as I said in my comment, I think the volume will be down a little bit because of the seasonality and the
increased rates. The margins are sort of clinking along what I would think would be the bottom right now. So I
don't expect those to go down much further. We don't – I think, as you point out, we don't do correspondent or
wholesale. So a lot of the adjustment for some of our peers out there, they do a lot more correspondent which I
think drives that margin down quite a bit. Ours is all retail and we don't deal in those other pillars of the mortgage
business. So, I would think that the margin would be about the same on lower volume. And so, revenues will – ex-
MSR valuations, et cetera, revenues or production revenue will be down slightly. But again, once you take out the
commissions, the expenses and taxes, the impact of that is going to be negligible relative to the increase in net
interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just changing gears and thinking about the deposit outlook. Just going back to the earlier
question. Curious, just in terms of your guys ability to kind of defend the deposit base and actually grow it, unlike
most peers thus far, in the 3Q earnings season? Is the deposit growth you're seeing largely from existing clients,
or are you guys seeing more opportunities to grow deposits just in light of all the acquisition-related disruption
across the Chicago land area these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Tim, why don't you handle that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Nate, it's really both. I mean, the disruption is certainly helpful. And as we bring clients over, we aim for a
full relationship which would include the deposit business. But we're sensitive to the deposit book and the excess
funds that all of our clients have and we will compete with – for those with everybody in the market. So, it's both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And just lastly, do you guys have an updated range in terms of where you want your loan-to-deposit ratio to
settle out into next year in light of maybe perhaps tamping down on some growth just to maybe keep that loan-to-
deposit ratio within the more comfortable range going forward?

Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, we've said 85 to low-90s, Nate. I don't think we would change that kind of for normal operating conditions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's been our preferred range, Nate, for every year that we've been a public company going back to 1996,
so that we're comfortable there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of
Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Please go ahead, Terry McEvoy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning. First off, I'm glad the surgery went well and, gosh, I can't imagine a Wintrust call without you. So I
just want to get that out there. So, from a, I guess, first question, as you think about that 4% margin in the first
quarter of next year and the upside to revenue, does that make you rethink your expense budget all for next year?
And can you push back at all on some of the concerns that banks spend away this higher NII on expenses next
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, [indiscernible] (32:29) this is Dave. I think that we have a three-year plan for technology investments and the
like. And we'll stick to that. We're not going to spend like drunken sailors. I think that we'll have continued to see
pressures on labor costs next year. But that is not a function of spending the money we make on the margin just
randomly. So we're going to try to control the expenses as best we can as if the margin didn't increase. And we'll
continue to invest in technology and expand the franchise as we normally would. Could there maybe be a
marginal project out there that maybe was on hold that we would throw into the kitty? Possibly, but it wouldn't be
material.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's right, Dave. And I think that, yeah, be really careful on your expenses going forward because
what comes up could come down. And although we're doing some things to hedge the downside risk of rates
falling again, the Fed is so active and somebody hiccups someplace and we're going to get our answers handed
to us in rates again. We can't afford to have that, and we're going to work very hard on that.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
But the fact is that I think that our prospects for growth are very good. I think the growth will help mitigate a lot of
these expenses because you're going to have increases in labor and what have you. They're not going to come
back at the end of the day. We're going to have to build that in, and then we're going to go through it. So the
organic growth and hopefully the acquisition market will come around again. But we've always been able to work
through and take what the market gives us, and we'll continue to do that.
I think our reputation and the market in Chicago being somewhat still kind of in turmoil with changes going on, I
think the opportunities for us here are still very good. Geographic expansion in our market, in our desired
marketplace, is also very good. I should note that we're opening up a – we've opened up a loan production office
and soon-to-be branch in Indiana, kind of West Indiana, which is good for us. We prefer to buy somebody there,
but maybe they'll sell to us and I guess we'll be like sweet worms or something.
But we're going to make it going into that market. I think that the way we – our culture, the way we operate the
organization, the way we present ourselves to our customers, as indicated by the J.D. Power Awards we get and
the Greenwich awards we get, will sell – sells very nicely into these new communities at very transportable, I
should say. So, we hope they will grow through it. And that would be the plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow-up and I'm a bit over my skis here, could you maybe talk about the decision to use
the collar where you've got to establish a floor and a cap versus just a straight-up swap? What type of protection
do you have there? Just so I can understand the decision. And then, going forward, do you think that down-rate
scenario, which went from 6.9 to negative 3.9. Do you expect that to continue to trend down over the coming
quarters through the use of additional swaps or collars?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Dave or Tim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We haven't disclosed what the outside parameters of those are. But we'll put that detail into the Q, Terry.
But generally speaking, it's probably mid-3s to low-4s as far as where the cap would kick in and then in the mid- to
high-2s for some of the floor where they would kick in. We'll give specifics in 10-Q and go through that. It's just a
start on that. So, we're trying to protect the downside. And the thought is, if you sell the cap on that, it helps to pay
for the downside protection. And because we're so asset sensitive, giving up a few basis points on the upside is
worth paying for the downside protection.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Wondering if you – just start, if you had the September margin and also the spot – deposit cost at the end of the
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. We haven't disclosed those, Chris. I think what we're going with the margin is we expect it to be north
of 3.70% in the fourth quarter. And so, you can probably sort of draw a straight-line if you look at where we went
from second quarter to third quarter, and the guidance we gave for the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the approaching 4% in Q1, obviously at a much better than what markets are expecting. I guess
maybe a question around peak margins or peak NII growth, how are you thinking about just the – if the Fed stops
early next year? How much of a lag there'll be on the deposit [indiscernible] (38:19) side and what you're doing to
kind of protect that roll over?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Chris, we're – our assumption right now is for another 150 basis points worth of Fed funds
increases, probably 75 basis points in November and then 75 basis points at some point after that. At those
levels, we get the approach to 4% during the first quarter. I think as the Fed stops raising rates, it's more likely
that the loan and asset repricing will mitigate deposit increase costs, which lag somewhat. So, there's lots of
moving parts. But the low-4% range is certainly reasonable given the current forecast. And if you things change,
we'll move accordingly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, low-4s after the first quarter is based on that assumption is what you're communicating? Okay. Thank
you.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yeah. So I had a question on the reserve currently the [ph] ACL is at (39:28) 83 basis points and I know it's higher
than it was pre-CECL and day one CECL. But I'm curious, what is your level of comfortable – comfort with that
going into kind of a economic environment that's deteriorating and if you think that's adequate for a more severe
recession or how high it could go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we obviously think it's adequate. And that's what we've stated if we look at our models, then. One of the
things you need to understand is that, that 83 basis point incorporates over a third of our balance sheet and
premium financed loans. And life loans are, historically, if you look at it have zero losses. And the P&C portfolio
has relatively low losses.
So if you look at table 12 of our press release, if you look at our core loans, we have 126 basis points of reserve
associated with those. But clearly, with the CECL modeling and the work that we do on that, we think it's
adequate. When you go back to the 2008-2009 timeframe, we were profitable in all of those years and generally
had lower losses than our parent. We think we're conservative. We monitor it. We deep dive deep into our
portfolios and look for trends. And right now, we feel comfortable with where it's at. But you do – there's people
that maybe don't follow us closely and they need to understand that that number is lower than some of our peers
because we have a third of our portfolio in very low risk, low loss asset classes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then following that, I'm not sure if you disclosed kind of the weightings, but there is some sort of a
qualitative overlay in particular that you think kind of gives you more comfort with that reserve level that you put
on based off of the calculations with the CECL [indiscernible] (41:30)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We don't disclose the difference between quantitative and qualitative factors out there, but I think
everybody has a qualitative process factored in. Ours generally is a qualitative process based on quantitative
analysis and input from the lines. But I think the answer to the question is we're very comfortable with our reserve
levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
