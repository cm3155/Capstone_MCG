Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings
call. I will begin with a review of our financial condition and results on slide 3 of this presentation.
This morning, we reported third quarter 2020 net income of $160 million or $1.12 per share, up 61% from second
quarter net income of $99 million or $0.70 per share. Our third quarter return on average assets was 1.26%,
return on average equity was 12.5%, and return on average tangible equity was 13.9%. Our profitability
rebounded from the trough of the second quarter as provision for credit losses declined.
Deposit growth this quarter was very healthy, but especially strong growth in non-interest-bearing demand
account, which grew 28% annualized quarter-over-quarter based on period-end balances and 22% annualized
based on average balances. As of September 30, we reached a record $41.7 billion in deposits, including a
record $14.9 billion in demand deposit accounts. We generate a positive loan growth also in the third quarter,
reaching a record $37.4 billion in loans as of September 30, 2020, despite a challenging backdrop of slow
economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The biggest driver for the quarter-over-quarter increases in net income was a reduction in the provision for credit
losses, which was $10 million in the third quarter, compared to $102 million in the second quarter. In the first half
of the year, we recorded $176 million in provision for credit losses compared to net charge-offs of $20 million,
substantially building our reserve level. Based on an improved macroeconomic outlook, we modestly decreased
our allowance for loan losses as of September 30. Overall, credit continues to be very manageable, as
demonstrated by net charge-offs at annualized 26 basis point of average loans.
Also in the third quarter, we earned $219 million of pre-tax pre-provision income on total revenue of $374 million.
Our pre-tax pre-provision profitability ratio was 1.74%. The steep decline in interest rates this year has impacted
our revenue. However, as the downward re-pricing of our earning assets to benchmark rate is largely complete,
and we continue to reduce the cost of funds as maturing CDs re-price lower, we anticipate that our pre-tax pre-
provision income and profitability will stabilize going forward. Importantly, our efficiency remains industry-leading
and is a key variable to maintaining above average pre-tax pre-provision profitability. Our efficiency ratio in the
third quarter was 41.3%.
Moving to slide 4 for a summary review of our balance sheet, our balance sheet is strong. We have high levels of
liquidity and capital. And as of September 30, 2020, we've crossed over than $50 billion in assets milestone,
ending the quarter at $50.4 billion. This translates to an organic compound annual growth rate of 10% over the
past five years.
Quarter-over-quarter, total loans of $37.4 billion increased $208 million or 2% linked quarter annualized. Total
deposits of $41.7 billion increased $1 billion or 10% annualized. Our deposit growth is a combination of

onboarding new clients, expanding existing relationships, and our clients maintaining high levels of liquidity. We
believe the momentum of strong deposit growth can be sustained post-pandemic. Due to our deposit growth this
quarter, our loan to deposit ratio as of September 30 was 89.8% compared to 91.5% as of June 30.
Now turning to slide 5, you can see that East West capital ratios are strong and growing, and are some of the
highest among regional banks, particularly for common and Tier 1 equity. Our book value and tangible equity
share were both up 3% from the prior quarter, and our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 9.3%.
You can see from the chart that all our capital ratios increased quarter-over-quarter.
East West board of directors has declared fourth quarter 2020 dividends for the company's common stock. A
common stock cash dividend of $0.275 is payable on November 16, 2020 to stockholders of record on November
2, 2020.
Moving on to a discussion about loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6, C&I loans, excluding PPP, were $11.5
billion as of September 30 or 31% of total loans. Total C&I commitments, excluding PPP, were $16.3 billion as of
September 30, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 5% annually. Month-over-month growth of loans outstanding
turned positive in September, reversing a trend of negative monthly growth since March. Overall, C&I loans
outstanding, excluding PPP, decreased by $144 million between June 30 and September 30, a decrease of 5%
annualized compared to a decrease of 29% annualized in the second quarter.
Moving to slide 7, as of September 30, our total commercial real estate portfolio was $14.7 billion or 39% of total
loans. Total commercial real estate loans grew $171 million or 5% annualized from June 30. The portfolio is well-
balanced across the major property types of retail, multifamily, office, industrial, and hotel. Our exposure to
construction and land loans remain low, at 1.5% of total loans.
You can see on slide 8 that the weighted average loan to value of our total commercial real estate portfolio is
51%, with an average loan size of only $2.4 million. Nearly 90% of our commercial real estate loans have an LTV
of 65% or lower. In the chart on the right, you can see that the weighted average loan to value of our loans by
property type range from 49% to 53%.
On slides 9 and 10, we provide additional details regarding our single family residential loans and home equity
lines. Combined, residential mortgage and other consumer loans make up 25% of our total loans. As of
September 30, our single family residential portfolio was $7.8 billion, up by $126 million or 7% annualized from
June 30.
In the third quarter, we originated $768 million of residential mortgage loans, consistent with the pace from the
first half of 2020 and up by 19% year-over-year from the third quarter of last year. We expect a similar pace of
origination for the fourth quarter. The average loan size in our residential mortgage portfolio is only $386,000, and
the weighted average loan to value was 53%. Again, 90% of our residential mortgage loans have an LTV, loan to
value, of 60% or less.
On to slide 10, as of September 30, we have $1.5 billion of home equity lines outstanding, plus $1.6 billion in
undisbursed commitments, translating into a utilization rate of 48%, unchanged from last quarter. Home equity
lines outstanding increased $52 million quarter-over-quarter or 14% annualized, and total commitment increased
11% annualized. The average size of our home equity commitment is $367,000, and the weighted average
combined LTV is only 48%. 97% of our home equity [audio gap] (00:12:30) commitment have an LTV, loan to
value, of under 60%.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start by discussing loans on COVID-19-related deferrals on slide 11. As of October 20,
loans on full payment deferral were 1.9% of total loans. Including loans on partial payment deferral [indiscernible]
(00:13:02) were modifications of principal and interest payment to interest only, loans on deferral totaled 3.4%.
Overall, 55% of commercial loans on deferral are still making partial payments.
Quarter-over-quarter, loans on COVID-19-related deferral decreased close to 50% between June 30 and
September 30, and decreased a further 20% month-to-date in October. The largest improvement was in
residential mortgage deferrals, which decreased by 79% since June 30, reflecting the resiliency of the East West
customer base.
Similar to the second quarter, the deferral rate on C&I loans continued to be very low. Commercial real estate
loans on deferral have also decreased, down to 6.6% as of October 20, comprised of 3.8% on partial payments
and 2.8% on full payment deferral, largely reflecting the longer COVID-19 impact on cash flows for certain
properties.
Turning to slide 12 for a review of our allowance for loan losses, and slide 13 for a review of our other asset
quality metrics. Our allowance for loan losses was $618 million as of September 30 or 1.65% of loans held for
investment, modestly down from $632 million or 1.7% of loans as of June 30. Since January 1, post-CECL, our
allowance increased $135 million and the coverage ratio increased by 26 basis points from 1.39%. The current
macroeconomic forecast has improved, projecting less severe economic conditions compared to June 30. This, in
turn, decreased the expected lifetime losses for the loan portfolio.
The forecast-driven reduction to the allowance was partially offset by increased qualitative reserves for oil and
gas and commercial real estate loans. The allowance coverage of our oil and gas portfolio was 10% as of
September 30, up from 9% as of June 30.
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were just under $25 million, and the net charge-off ratio was 26 basis
points of average loans annualized. Charge-offs in the third quarter were primarily from oil and gas loans, which
accounted for $22 million or 91% of net charge-offs, while charge-offs from other loan classes remain at low
levels. Reflecting these drivers and assumptions, we recorded a $10 million provision for credit losses during the
third quarter of 2020 compared to $102 million in the second quarter.
Turning to slide 13, on this page, we detail out the components of criticized assets. Criticized loans were 3.9% of
total loans as of September 30, totaling $1.5 billion. The largest concentration within criticized loans by either
industry or property type remains oil and gas, although criticized C&I loans are diversified by industry and the
criticized commercial real estate loans are likewise largely diversified by property type.
Special mention loans were 1.9% of total loans as of September 30 in the amount of $723 million, up from 1.5%
of total loans as of June 30, an increase of 26%. The quarter-over-quarter increase in special mention loans was
largely due to inflows from commercial real estate. As of September 30, 10.5% of oil and gas loans, 2.8% of all
other C&I loans, and 2.1% of commercial real estate loans were graded special mention.
Classified loans were 2% of total loans as of September 30 in the amount of $758 million, compared to 1.8% as of
June 30, an increase of 11%. The quarter-over-quarter increase in classified loans was largely driven by
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
downgrades of oil and gas loans followed by downgrades of all other C&I loans. As of September 30, 23.5% of oil
and gas loans, 2% of all other C&I, and 1.6% of commercial real estate loans were classified. Non-performing
assets were 52 basis points of total assets as of September 20 in the amount of $260 million, compared to 41
basis points as of June 30, an increase of 29%. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-performing assets was
primarily due to net inflows of previously classified oil and gas loans to non-accrual status.
Lastly, accruing loans 30 to 89 days past due were $85 million or 23 basis points of total loans as of September
30, a quarter-over-quarter improvement of 25% from $113 million or 30 basis points of total loans as of June 30.
As you can see in our credit quality metrics, outside of oil and gas, asset quality is moving across our other loan
portfolios.
In terms of oil and gas, I'd like to note that we continue to reduce our exposures through paydowns, workouts, and
charge-offs. Oil and gas loans outstanding are down 8% quarter-over-quarter and down 12% year-to-date.
Including undisbursed commitments, total oil and gas commitments are down 8% quarter-over-quarter and down
17% year-to-date. In terms of hedges in place for our E&P borrowers, 52% of their planned 2021 oil production is
hedged and 59% of their planned 2021 gas production is hedged.
And now moving to a discussion of our income statement on page 14. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement which I will discuss in more detail on the following slides. Amortization of tax credit and
other investments was $12 million in the third quarter compared to $25 million in the second quarter. The quarter-
over-quarter change reflects timing of tax credit investments, and we expect this number to be approximately $20
million in the fourth quarter.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 90%, up from 12% in the second quarter of 2020. The quarter-over-
quarter increase in the tax rate reflects the increase in pre-tax income. Third quarter income before taxes was
$196 million, a 75% increase from $112 million in the second quarter as we increased our estimate for the full
year effective tax rate to 15%. The 19% effective tax rate for the third quarter includes a true-up to the higher full
year effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be close to the full year effective tax rate
of 15%.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 15 through 18, starting
with average balance sheet growth. Third quarter average loans of $37.2 billion grew quarter-over-quarter.
Growth in commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and PPP loans was offset by a decrease in C&I loans.
Third quarter average deposits of $41.2 billion grew 13% linked quarter annualized, driven by strong growth in
demand and checking accounts offset by a reduction in high-cost time deposits. Average non-interest-bearing
deposit accounts grew 22% linked quarter annualized and made up 35% of total deposits in the third quarter, up
from 34% in the second quarter and 29% in the year-ago quarter.
With a strong deposit growth in excess of loan growth, the average loan to deposit ratio decreased to 90% in the
third quarter, down from 93% in the second quarter. Excluding PPP loans where we match funded 75% with the
PPPLF, the average loan to deposit ratio was 86% in the third quarter.
Accordingly, average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks increased by $1.5 billion in the third quarter
and made up 10% of average earning assets, up from 8% in the second quarter. This growth on lower-yielding
assets was a headwind to the net interest margin this quarter. We continue to deploy excess liquidity into
available-for-sale securities, but given the low interest rates and the flat curve, attractive opportunities are limited.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
In the current environment, we are comfortable in managing the balance sheet with a higher level of liquidity and
recognize that when loan growth accelerates, as it is starting to, this headwind to net interest margin will largely
self-cure.
On slide 16, you can see that third quarter 2020 net interest income of $324 million decreased by $20 million or
6% linked quarter, and the net interest margin of 2.72% compressed by 32 basis points from the prior quarter.
However, excluding the impact of PPP loans and the PPPLF, third quarter adjusted net interest income of $318
million declined by 2% or $5 million quarter-over-quarter, exhibiting relative stability. Third quarter adjusted net
interest margin of 2.77% compressed by 19 basis points from second quarter.
PPP loan interest and deferred fee income was $6.5 million in the third quarter, down from $21 million in the
second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter fluctuation is due to changes we made to our estimate for expected
forgiveness of PPP loans by the SBA resulting in reduced deferred fee accretion for the third quarter.
The quarter-over-quarter change in net interest margin breaks down as follows: negative 14 basis points from
lower loan yields, negative 6 basis points from lower other earning asset yields, negative 12 basis points from
excess liquidity with higher balances of interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, as well as a negative 13
basis points of interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, as well as a negative 13 basis points of negative
impact from less PPP income, partially offset by 12 basis points from a lower cost of deposits and 1 basis point
from a lower cost of borrowings. Headwinds then have been deposit growth in excess of loan growth, a lack of
attractive redeployment yields for excess liquidity. But we see several tailwinds that should improve the NIM and
the net interest income going forward.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we anticipate that our GAAP net interest income will grow by 3% to 5% and that
our GAAP net interest margin will range from 2.75% to 2.85% including PPP income. The drivers for our net
interest income and NIM outlook are as follows. First, continued reduction in deposit costs from the repricing of
maturing CDs. We have $1.4 billion in CDs at a weighted average interest rate of 1.45% maturing in the fourth
quarter, and another $1.3 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 1.26% in Q1 of 2021.
Second, partial repayment of the PPPLF ahead of PPP loan forgiveness for our customers, a process that we
have already begun. Month-to-date in October, we repaid $524 million. Also, we expect to recognize $15 million
of PPP loan deferred fee and interest income in the fourth quarter. And thirdly, general stability for loan yields as
downward repricing of variable rate loans has largely run its course.
Now, turning to slide 17. Third quarter average loan yields of 3.60% contracted by 38 basis points from last
quarter, reflecting downward repricing of variable rate loans to benchmark interest rates, as well as the reduced
fee income accreted on PPP loans.
Excluding the impact of PPP, the third quarter adjusted loan yield of 3.70% contracted by 20 basis points quarter-
over-quarter. In the second quarter, the quarter-over-quarter contraction and the average loan yield excluding the
impact of PPP was 81 basis points. 65% of East West loan portfolio is variable rate, and by now these loans have
largely repriced. Nearly 90% of variable rate loans we have are linked to benchmark interest rates with a duration
of three months or less.
In the upper right quadrant, we've laid out a new chart showing our average loan yields by portfolio. As you can
see, our single family residential mortgage product is a least rate-sensitive portfolio and continues to carry
attractive yields. To organically reduce asset sensitivity, we have been growing fixed-rate loans notably in single
family. Year-over-year, fixed-rate loans, excluding PPP, increased by 30%.

Turning to slide 18. Against the backdrop of materially lower interest rates, declines in earning-asset yields have
been partially offset by decreases in the cost of funds. Our average cost of deposits for the third quarter dropped
to 33 basis points, down from 47 basis points in the second quarter, an improvement of 14 basis points. The spot
rate of total deposits as of September 30 was 29 basis points.
Our third quarter average cost of interest-bearing deposits dropped to 50 basis points, down from 71 basis points
in the second quarter, an improvement of 19 basis points. The spot rate of interest-bearing deposits as of
September 30 was 46 basis points. In the lower left quadrant, we present our third quarter 2020 cost of deposit by
deposit category compared to the cost of deposits in the third quarter of 2015 which was the last full quarter under
a zero interest rate policy before the Fed raised rates in December 2015.
At that time, the average cost of deposits was 28 basis points and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits
was 40 basis points. We included this chart in the deck as we believe it provides additional context of the repricing
lever within our cost of deposits. You can clearly see that our CD book has not fully repriced down to historic
reserve levels.
We expect to continue to reduce our average cost of CDs. Maturing CDs over the next six months repriced lower,
bringing the total cost of deposits down further. The rate paid on originations and renewals of domestic CDs in the
third quarter of 2020 was 43 basis points and the retention rate of branch CDs has been an excellent 92%.
Quarter-to-date, rates paid on our CD originations and renewals have been lower than in the third quarter. Also,
as of yesterday, the spot rate for our cost and interest-bearing deposits is down to 42 basis points. And for our
total cost of deposits, it's down 27 basis points.
Moving on to fee income on slide 19, total non-interest income in the third quarter was $50 million, compared to
$59 million in the second quarter. Fee income and net gains on sales of loans was $48 million in the third quarter,
down by $4 million or 8% quarter-over-quarter. Lending fees of $19 million decreased by $3 million largely
reflecting valuation changes for warrants received as part of lending relationships.
Third quarter lending fees included $4 million from the increase in the valuation of warrants. In comparison,
second quarter included $8 million from an increase in the valuation of warrants. Included in lending fees are
customer-driven letters of credit fees valuation of warrants. Including in lending fees are customer-driven letters of
credit fees, which increased quarter-over-quarter and parallel with increased customer activity.
Reflecting an increase in the number or customer accounts and customer-driven transactions, deposit account
fees and wealth management fees increased quarter-over-quarter. Foreign exchange fees decreased quarter-
over-quarter due to downward revaluations of FX-denominated balance sheet items, partially offset by an
increase in customer-driven transactions.
Moving on to slide 20, third quarter non-interest expense was $168 million, a decrease of 11% linked quarter.
Excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted
non-interest expense was $154 million in the third quarter, an increase of only 1% quarter-over-quarter and a
decrease of 3% year-over-year.
I would also note that excluding the impact of PPP loan origination costs deferred in the second quarter, third
quarter compensation expense of $100 million decreased 4% quarter-over-quarter to $104 million in the second

quarter . In the second quarter, $7 million of the compensation expense associated with PPP loan originations
was deferred.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in computer software expense reflects amortization of previously capitalized
investment spend. Our third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 41.3%. Over the past five quarters, our
efficiency ratio has ranged from 37.7% to 41.3%. As an organization, we remain committed to controlling
expenses across the board in order to support our strong profitability.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Dominic closing remarks.

If you could just start with credit, Dominic. When we look at the provisioning level, I think assuming that the macro
doesn't deteriorate from here, just talk to us in terms of your comfort around the portfolio? Well, one, like, what do
you expect with the rest of the deferrals that are still outstanding as we get towards the end of the year? What
percentage of those do you expect to go into non-accrual versus go back to paying? And what have you learned
about the portfolio in the last six months to give us comfort that you're not going to have negative credit surprises
in 2021?

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we've been actually looking at our credit portfolio sector-by-sector and within the C&I also in commercial real
estate, in the C&I, with all the different industry vertical, each vertical got review loan-by-loan. CRE, we break it
down by if it is hotel, office building, multifamily, and then region-by-region. And obviously our single family
mortgages hardly have any problem and has always been for many years. So we've done all of that kind of
review. And we, as of today, feel pretty good about where we are today.
We think our reserve is definitely adequate. And in terms of our risk rating classification and so forth, and we feel
that we are very much current in terms of the classification. From the deferral point of view, as you can see from
June 30 to September 30 and all the way, even we showed that the deferral as of two days ago, it continued to
show great progress. And we, at this point, do not see a lot of concern about surprises.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just in terms of capital, I think, Dominic, you mentioned on CET 1 even on tangible equity, you have
one of the stronger capital levels, you were conservative coming into the cycle, not buying back stock. Just talk to
us in terms of how you think about capital allocation maybe not in the next couple of months, but as we look into
the first half of next year and your, I guess, desire to buy back stock if it stays where it is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we have board meetings every 2, 2.5 months or so, so this is always like, I would say, the outstanding
agenda. So we update the information, financial condition, and balance sheet, and also mainly the economic
outlook with the board members. And then with those information, we deliver it. And then we have discussion of
whether we take any kind of action. So at this stage right now, I would say that this – and we are still in that
pandemic environment. We are not going to be looking into buying back stock. On the other hand, comes 2021,
things can change dramatically in terms of the economic outlook. And then we will do whatever is right
accordingly based on the circumstances at that point.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. Thanks. I guess maybe just looking for a little more detail on the NPA increase. I know you said it
was driven by oil and gas. I guess the concern that we would have is, does it continue, right? I mean, obviously
you still have a sizable portfolio. It is running off. But is the worries – does it continue/do you have to build
reserves for the portfolio as it deteriorates? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Ken, that's a great question. When we look at the increase in non-accrual loans and also charge-offs really over
the course of last year and beyond that really, a lot of that have come from the oil and gas portfolio. And we have
also increased the reserves, let's say, quarter-over-quarter 9% to 10%. So when I look at it from the perspective
of where the loss content is, I do think it's still in our portfolio in oil and gas. I would say though when these loans

were previously classified, they are identified. And one thing that is positive is that we're not seeing ongoing kind
of downward deterioration into classified assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would say – Ken, let me just maybe add onto what Irene just shared, is that would there be a likelihood of
more potential charge-off losses from the oil and gas portfolio? Definitely, there is that probability. The difference
is that we feel very confident because we only have so many loans in the oil and gas portfolio, and it's dwindling
down. And there are just so many loans in there. And we have looked at every one of them and we continue to
classify them in the right bucket. And the macroeconomic condition as of today is actually more positive than a
few months ago.
We all recall back in late March and early April, the crude oil prices just dropped to a level that is unheard of. But
it's been pretty much stabilized at that $40 per barrel and then the gas price actually have gone up quite nicely.
And then keep in mind also that our portfolio has, Irene shared earlier, I mean, substantial percentage of these
loans are properly hedged even going into 2021. So it's not like these are the loans that on a daily basis they are
going one by one, going into [ph] double (00:39:06).
I think what we experience in terms of the charge-offs are somewhat relative to peers in that industry. And
everyone get – like from the oil and gas business. So from our perspective is that this is a portfolio that is getting
smaller and smaller and we have substantial reserve to provide for it and we feel confident that we can manage
that. And in addition to it, we have plenty of profits and income to offset against these losses and still come up
with a decent return of equity and return of assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. And is it a long-term plan just to keep running it off? Because I guess it's just hard for us to see how this
segment generates positive risk-adjusted returns given every few years it almost feels like there's a problem and
losses spike. I'm not talking positive risk-adjusted returns over like a multi-year period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are managing it down and then we started managing it down last year and then we continue to manage it
down. But the environment keep changing. Who knows what's going to happen from the demand around the
world or in United States or even technological advancements that change the dynamic, that we have no ability to
project. I mean, as a bank, we basically facilitate financing with a very, very focus of risk management. If we feel
that this is going to be an industry going forward that we can manage the risk very effectively, there is no reason
why we're not into this segment. I think this all get back down to, we will be always very prudent to watch what's
going on in the future and do the right thing accordingly.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking out at the expense side and the efficiency side, do you think given the broader low rate environment we
can get back to a sub-40% efficiency ratio? Or will that really depend on seeing some broader rate improvement?
Or is there anything you can do on the expense side to help accelerate that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Jared, I'll take that question. I think the largest variable for that would be on the revenue side. As we talked
about earlier in our prepared remarks, we do feel strongly fourth quarter and beyond that revenue, net interest
margin, NII will increase. I think we have a long history of proven ability to control the expenses. And that's
something that we feel confident in this type of environment that we'll be able to continue to do so while still
making the appropriate investments that we need to support our growing business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then shifting a little bit to the CRE portfolio and the growth you saw this quarter. I guess how
much of that was refi-ing, I guess, somebody else's loan? And what gives you – how are you getting comfort
putting on new CRE product now? And is that translating into better terms and conditions in pricing, or I guess
maybe your thoughts around what you're seeing and doing on the CRE side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In terms of – with CRE loans that we originated, most of – I mean, almost all of them are with customers that
we've been doing business for a long time. And these are – customers have very strong financial and balance
sheet that we feel comfortable. And then obviously these are the properties that are less impacted negatively by
the pandemic, and that's what we originated, these new loans. Some of them are not refi. Some of them are just
also taking shares from other banks and so forth. The pricing is getting better slightly better than it was, I would
say, six, nine months ago. Obviously, CRE pricing was extremely competitive last year. It's no longer as
competitive. So we will be – I would say that originating CRE loan with a slightly better pricing going forward.
In terms of volume of CRE loans, I would think that in 2021, we probably may not have as nice of a robust growth
of CRE origination like we did in 2019. So you would expect that 2021 the growth rate will be tempered somewhat
because of the lack of great quality asset to be financed. But we'll continue to look. And [indiscernible] (00:44:26)
East West is not a giant institution. It's not that difficult for us to keep looking and finding gems, hide around the
bushes, and then just make up enough to show positive growth rate.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question. I want to ask about everyone's favorite topic on taxes. Given the market's
expectation that there could be a tax rate increase next year, could you walk us through the potential sensitivity
on the tax line and also the amortization line given that you guys have been a little bit more proactive in managing
your taxes over the years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Chris, so when we look at the changes that might happen from a corporate tax rate, 21% to 27% of that at this
point in time, although there a lot of moving parts, we think if that happens, the impact to us will be about 4%. On
the rest of it with the amortization, once we have this call in January to talk about fourth quarter, we can give you
a little bit more details on that. Along with that, if that happens, I'll add, at this point in time, we have about $20
million at DDAs that would reverse as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then assuming this status quo just for modeling purposes, I think you said for the fourth quarter,
amortization of $20 million. That would bring it to around $75 million for the year. All else equal, is that the right
math for next year, 15% tax rate and $75 million or so on the amortization?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A

We'll talk about that in January.

On credit, you talked about the reserve release a bit. I was just wondering if you could maybe just give a little bit
more detail on your comfort level reducing that reserve on your CRE book at this point, were there still uncertainty
in the economy and how the remaining deferrals in that book are going to pan out? This quarter, we saw other
banks building that reserve in that particular bucket. So I was just wondering what your thoughts were for this

quarter, and then if you could talk about how much stimulus that you have baked into your outlook at this point,
that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. So if we look at kind of the breakdown of our allowance, the amount of reserve that we have set aside for
our new estate loans is just over $200 million. So – on income producing real estate, and also multi-family. So
ultimately, I would say right now, deferrals, what we're seeing in the portfolio, our customers were very
comfortable with that allowance level. Depending on what happens with the forecast, we'll look and see as far as
is the level appropriate. For our allowance calculation, we rely on Moody's and the economic forecast there to
kind of tailor to our portfolio.
We do use a multi-scenario approach baseline, S1 and S3, because S3 is a more severe adverse scenario,
overall I'll share that the reserve, the quantitative reserve that we set aside is higher than the baseline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And then how much stimulus is baked into your overall outlook at this point? Were you guys assuming for
additional government stimulus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So and I think I'll just break it down with the scenario. So baseline did assume $1.5 trillion or the S3
assumed none. So as I mentioned, the overall quantitative reserve that we have is higher than the baseline.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. A lot of questions have been answered but I was curious on your comments on prepaying
the PPP. I think you said, if I remember, the $24 million month-to-date in terms of the liquidity facility. How much
of that do you expect to exit by year-end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So we paid off the $453 million. We all evaluate and see if as far – excuse me, $423 million. We'll evaluate and
see if we'll pay off more. I think more than the $523 million is expected depending on how much and the timing of
that. We'll look and see as far as the liquidity that we have. And then also, the pace of the forgiveness of the PPP
loans which has started for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then just in terms of overall balance sheet, you talked about kind of holding some of that liquidity you
have in anticipation of loan growth improving. Do you have any – and also continue with your deposits even post-
pandemic at a good pace. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are for expectations overall liquidity flows given
the amount of excess funding in the system right now?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think that's a great question especially in this quarter. What we've done especially as deposit flow
has continued, I think we've gone a little bit more comfortable reinvesting some of that into securities, and also
with our securities book, our AFS securities book, we have extended out the duration a little bit. So I think if you
look at the month of September, not quarter-to-date and the average yields in the portfolio, it is up a little bit close
to 2%. If you look at duration, at 6/30, we were about 2.6% and we're at about 3.8% as of 9/30.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe first on special – the increase in special mention, I think you've touched the fact that the
commercial real estate migrated a little bit. Can you give us some specific examples of what migrated this
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Matthew, when we look at kind of the migration into a special mention during the quarter, it was really, to a
certain extent, throughout the portfolio. I'll share regardless of whether a customer is on deferral, we're making
sure that the grading is appropriate. If necessarily, we are downgrading these loans. So, some of the loans we
downgraded were loans that were on deferral, but across the board, I would say in different kind of asset classes,
office, multifamily, and also, retail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, just on the deferrals of C&I, ex-energy, has been fairly muted to date. Can you give us a sense
for why that is and what your customers are saying at this point, whether or not that might increase in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It doesn't look like that at this point in time. I think we shared about this last quarter as well. We did initially, as an
accommodation for our customers, help them with a one month, we called it a skip-a-pay. Certainly, I think that
helped us kind of reach out and have those conversations with our customers on the C&I front. I think the
requests and kind of conversations that we've had, the requests for deferrals and the conversations we've had
with our customers around our cash flows has generally been relatively positive.

trend going forward. But on C&I, if we exclude PPP, what type of growth are you expecting in that loan category?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well for 2021, we do plan to provide guidance at the next earnings release. I mean, at this point, it will be too
early for us, right, in the midst of this upcoming Presidential election, with the mystery about when the vaccine will
be available, all of sort of things that are happening right now. I just feel that it will be much better for us to have
the loan growth guidance to provide to you in January.
But in the meantime, all I can share as of today is that in the second quarter, April, May, and June, we spent a lot
of time focusing on PPP skip-a-payment deferral, which took a lot of time. Number one thing is to focus on
keeping our employees in great health. And thank goodness, as of today, we do not have one employee actually
went to a hospital for COVID-19 [indiscernible] (00:54:48). And so, all of us are in very good health. We are going
to continue to stay vigilant to keep everyone in good health so that we can take care of our customers, and that's
number one thing that we're focusing on. And then, PPP kept us very busy. And while we're doing PPP, we're
also looking into potential deferral and so forth. Some customers just get confused. They don't really need – they
didn't need a deferral. They just thought they have to get a deferral. So a lot of conversation going on back then.
So not until sometime in the third quarter, when these kind of issues all settled, our frontline relationship
managers and branch managers have start – I mean, really reaching out and then looking for new business. The
good news is that as we highlighted in our talk earlier, that in the latter part of September, we started really
booking some nice C&I loans and we started seeing growth in C&I, and actually, many of these loans that we
originated are brand new customers.
I think that to a certain degree, we're fortunate by being active helping our customers and even non-customers for
PPP or other type of matters that banking-related, call some of these very good prospects to decide to move their
banking relationship from [ph] other (00:56:21) banks to East West. So, we're picking up some new business. So,
that's positive. The first three weeks of October, we also continue to bring in new business from other banks, and
that has been very, very helpful for us, and we hope this trend will continue.
Now, given the fact that we are still in the midst of a pandemic, there are not going to be a lot of commercial
business that are out there aggressively putting capital investment or growth, other than the one that who happen
to be in the business that the pandemic helped them. For those who are in some of the traditional business, the
pandemic may not help them. I think their utilization rate for their line of credit will probably continue to stay a little
bit lower. So, we don't expect that many of the existing customers can have a strong push to draw down the line
dramatically higher to cause a substantial growth there, but we are getting new customers that supplement the
growth.
So all in all, I think at this point, we feel that fourth quarter looking more positive from the C&I side. And by the
way, it's not just coming from one particular industry or one particular geographic region. It's pretty much across
the board for East West Bank. Several industry verticals, even our entertainment business, are growing nicely
back. Our digital media business are growing – coming back strong. And so, our clean energy, the project
finance, those type of business are all coming back stronger than before. So, we hope this trend will continue in
2021. But for the detail of providing some sort of a forecast for growth on the lending side [indiscernible]
(00:58:20) to the fourth quarter 2021 – January 2021.

Yes. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, shifting gears to fee income, you mentioned about how customer
transaction activity increased in the third quarter. Curious as to what the outlook is for the fourth quarter of that
customer transaction activity. That momentum continued into the fourth quarter and we should expect either
stabilization or a rebound. Just curious as to your thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. As you can see, the fee income side, for customer-related banking transaction type of fee income have all
picked up. So if you look at, for example, like deposit account fees, that has a lot to do with this new banking
relationship that I talked about earlier and some of the existing customers expanding their relationship with us.
That combination of two result in us generating even stronger cash management fee income.
Keep in mind, though, we talked about, for the last few years, about investing in the internal infrastructure and
product enhancement, technology improvement. All of those costs that we put in are generating tangible results.
We've built a cash management system that can not only just accommodate but actually offer great services to
many of the more sophisticated larger-sized business who now can just comfortably move their banking
relationship from large banks to East West Bank because we have the capability to handle their cash
management needs. So, that result in more fee income for us and larger DDA account deposits. And we see that
trend as very positive, that we are able to do all of that while a lot of us are still working at home under the
pandemic.
So, what we're looking forward to is to continue to keep pushing and both working with existing customer,
expanding and deepening the banking relationship, and also getting new customers from the outside. So I look at
from the cash management, wealth management, and even trade finance, we have a 9% pick up in term of
business.
So all in all, I look at it is that we're just going to continue to focusing on making sure that we take good care of
our clients, and then, hopefully, we'll get more new business through this referral from our big clients and so forth,
and then, one step at a time, and then, getting more meaningful core fee income coming to the bank in 2021.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Dominic, you've talked a lot in the past about the political environment or at least a bit in the past about it.
So obviously, you've been pretty fraught between the US and China. As we look at potentially a Biden win, how
do you think this could potentially change your business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We always are sort of like an organization that's very nimble in terms of adjusting comfortably with whatever the
political environment that is out there. Do recall four years ago, the US government policy has been very, very
much wanted to bring in investments from China and also investing in China and so forth. And for the last couple
of years, due to Presidential election and then the political rhetoric had turned hostile, and that have changed the
dynamic dramatically. And we looked at even with the trade war in place for the last few years with the tariff, as
you have seen so far, we have such a big trade finance portfolio, import/export business, and then also, with
Greater China exposure, but at the end of the day, we hardly have any losses.

East West Bancorp, Inc.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Now, the business slowed down a bit because we're being more cautious temporarily, and then also, of course,
because of the pandemic, actually, China shut down for a few months. And so, that had affect the growth aspect,
but in terms of from a risk aspect, we managed very, very well and have almost no losses.
So with that in mind, I would say that looking forward, Joe Biden had made it very, very clear about his foreign
policy, which is to get back instead of American go alone and against the world and Americans going to work with
allies, and it's going to take leadership back into United Nation, WHO, WTO, et cetera, and US and then get back
into the front seat. And I am 100% sure when US wanted to get back into the front seat and engaging with their
allies, and China will be more than delighted to step back to stick a second or third or fourth seat and to
collaborate with the United States for climate change and all the other activities that all the nations around the
world need to work together.
So I would expect that if that happen, there's no question whether as a Republican Party or a Democrat, at the
end of the day, US will compete with China economically, and I think it's the right thing to do to compete. There's
nothing wrong to compete. But on the other hand, I think that I have also strong confidence that there's going to
be a lot more business exchange between US and China. Just reflect back for the last few months.
Now, while it doesn't get a whole lot of news coverage, but JPMorgan, Citibank, Morgan Stanley all increased
their stake in their joint venture in China, are taking majority ownership. BlackRock, Neuberger Berman and a few
others, and the fund management business are getting new licenses. Insurance company getting new life
licenses. Every day, American Express getting new license, Costco opening more stores, Starbucks opening
more stores. In fact, US business never stopped, never stopped expanding into China, and the Chinese
government also have never stopped bringing them in and giving them even more business opportunities than
have ever been given before.
In fact, just last week, a senior minister in China are talking about additional intellectual protection right for foreign
direct investments in China. So on a day-to-day basis, for people like us, they're constantly watching what's
happening between US and China and actually do look at regulation instead of just mainstream media news. We
are seeing China making an aggressive effort to continue to open up the market, letting foreign investors to take
on the majority ownership or full ownership in notable different industries, granting license that they've never
granted before, and then, changing the law of intellectual property protection, and also, penalizing company that
[ph] force (01:07:12) transfer of technology and so forth. All of those things that we've been hearing many, many
times from the US Trade Representative Lighthizer, all of those things that we've been hearing, they're making
the changes to it. Now, they're not broadcasting all over the world, but they are making the changes and the
business whether from US or from Europe are directly benefiting from it.
So in this our position is that, well, most of those are irrelevant to us to a certain degree because we're not going
there to get some big capital investments and then get some license for certain type of new business. Our
position is that the cross-border business is still strong. And China has emerged from the pandemic, back to
business as usual. Many of my colleagues in Shanghai and Shenzhen, they go out to movie theaters, having
dinner with their friends, don't even have to wear a mask. So, I'm happy for them. So, they are doing business
and we absolutely are there doing business also.
You look at Hong Kong. Hong Kong – the Stock Exchange is going to overpass US in terms of IPO listing
because companies are all going there lining up, unicorn after unicorn, lining up in Hong Kong or in Shanghai
Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Through these IPOs, there can be a lot more new millionaires to
billionaires, and they all need to make investments. They all need to have their personal wealth management and
18

they are buying properties around the world, US still one of the preferred places for either real estate investments
or other investments.
So, we do feel comfortable that business is going to be there. So, we have no ability to predict what the outcome
is for the election coming on November 3, but one way or the other, one thing I can guarantee everyone, East
West knows how to adjust and adapt and find way to thrive under whatever circumstances.
