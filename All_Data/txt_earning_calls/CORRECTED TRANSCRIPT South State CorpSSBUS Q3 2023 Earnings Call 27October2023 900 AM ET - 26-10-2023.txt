Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thank you, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. In the earnings release last night, you can see
that South State delivered a solid quarter that was right in line with our previous guidance. Will can cover the
details, but high level, we continue to see steady growth in loans and customer deposits. Liquidity is stable.
Capital ratios are growing. Deposit funding is best-in-class, and our net interest margin is settling in at a pretty
good spot. One of the core values that we continually preach to our team is to keep our eye on the long-term
horizon. So we spend a lot of time talking about the big picture, talking about the economic cycle and where we
have risk and where we have advantages.
The stages of a banking cycle are simple and predictable. The cycle risks move from liquidity then to earnings,
then to credit, and then finally to capital. But while the stages are easy to predict, predicting the speed and the
severity of the cycle, that's the tough part. Since March, we've clearly moved through the first phase, the liquidity
tightening phase as deposits left the banking system for money market funds. Now the predictable and necessary
response is that the industry trades away future earnings power as deposit costs rise.
Now, for South State, our granular deposit base has served as a ballast for our franchises and we've been able to
continue to grow our deposits with a cumulative deposit beta of only 27% and a total cost of deposits of 1.44% for
the quarter. Over on the asset side, we're also about to benefit from a tailwind of loan repricing. 70% of our loans
are based on a fixed or adjustable rate. So we're going to see a significant portion of our loan portfolio repriced by
more than 300 basis points as they renew. And that should help offset any additional drift in deposit costs.
Now, it feels like the velocity of change for deposits is moderating and we're now shifting to the credit risk portion
of the cycle. In the last year, we've set aside $151 million in reserves with only $18 million in charge-offs. And as a
result, we built our reserves up by 28 basis points to 1.59%. Now, the cycle is more severe than many are
predicting. Those reserves, plus our excess capital, will allow South State to be opportunistic on the back side of
the cycle where the opportunities to create shareholder value are the greatest. So we're cautious now. The lag
effects of the rapid rise in rates are only just beginning to work their way through the system.
But at the same time, we're excited. We think that there is a tremendous opportunity on the horizon for a bank of
our size in our geography and with our deposit franchise. So I want to close by thanking our team for keeping their
eye on a long-term horizon and building a franchise that can weather the storm and come out stronger on the
other side.
I'll pass it back to Will now to provide some color on the quarter.

William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thank you, John. We had another solid quarter with deposit costs, margin and non-interest income ending up in
line with our expectations, solid PPNR and good credit costs outside of the one sizable charge-off that impacted
us and some of our peers.
I'll touch on a few details before we move on to Q&A. On the balance sheet, our 6% annualized loan growth
moderated from the first half of the year, in line with our expectation. Deposits grew at a 2% annualized rate or
4% if you exclude the approximately $130 million in brokerage CD maturities we allowed to run off without
replacing.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
Though we continue to see a mix shift in our deposits from DDA and the money market accounts, the pace of the
DDA shift moderated a bit this quarter. DDA is represented 30% of total deposits at quarter end, down from 31%
last quarter. And as we mentioned previously, this figure was 28% to 29% before the pandemic. So it continues to
appear as if we're moving towards those pre-pandemic levels for DDA as a percentage of deposits.
Turning to the income statement, our 3.50% NIM was down 12 basis points from Q2. Loan yields were up 14
basis points, but deposits were up 33 basis points, which was in line with our 30 basis point to 35 basis point
guidance, bringing our cycle to date deposit beta to 27%. Our net interest income of $355 million was down $7
million from Q2 on one more day. Non-interest income of $73 million was down $4 million from Q2 though still a
solid quarter. Correspondent revenue was $13 million after $12 million in interest expense on swap collateral for
$25 million in gross revenue down approximately $3 million from Q2.
Wealth had another solid quarter, but mortgage revenue of $2.5 million was down $1.9 million from Q2. We had
another good quarter in deposit fees similar to Q2. Expenses came in a bit lower than expected this quarter
largely due to a revaluation of SERP retirement plan liabilities due to higher interest rates reducing NIE by $5.9
million. We also made a $1 million donation during the quarter for which we received a dollar-for-dollar tax credit.
So NIE was higher by $1 million in the quarter and income tax was lower by the same amount. Excluding that,
NIE was in line with our expectations.
Looking ahead, we expect NIE for Q4 in the mid-240s range subject to normal variations in expense categories
impacted by noninterest income and performance. With respect to credit, we recognized the $13 million in net
charge-offs in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $17.5 million or 8 basis points annualized year-to-
date. The one sizable SNC loan charge-off that received a lot of attention earlier in the quarter accounted for all of
the low net charge-offs as we experienced net loan recoveries before overdraft losses, absent that credit, both for
the quarter and year-to-date.
We continue to build loan loss reserves with a $33 million provision, bringing the total reserve to 159 basis points
of loans. For overall asset quality trends, NPAs were down slightly, past dues were flat, substandard loans
increased, and special mention loans declined. Line utilization continues to be flat except on construction lines, as
we're not originating many new construction loans and existing projects move towards completion. We continue to
have very strong capital ratios with CE tier one of 11.5% or 9.25% if AOCI were included in the calculation.
TCE ended the quarter at 7.5%. With loan growth expectations continuing to moderate, risk-weighted assets
growth should be in a range that allows us to continue to grow our regulatory capital ratios and provide us with
flexibility.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Stephen Scouten at Piper Sandler.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're expecting on the NIM
side moving forward and deposit trends from a cost perspective. And obviously, it's catching up a little bit, but still
extremely strong. So just kind of wondering what you're expecting in the months ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Stephen. This is Steve. We – as you know, page 12 shows kind of a summary of our NIM over the last four
quarters and you can see a 3.5% this this past quarter, which was within our guidance. And our deposit costs
were up 33 basis points this past quarter, which was in the 30 basis points to 35 basis points guided.
So we so far have sort of been where we thought we were. As we look forward, our guidance is really around
three things: interest earning assets, the rate forecast and deposit beta. And, really, our interest-earning assets
are, well pretty flat, I would expect going into the fourth quarter. As we think about Moody's consensus forecast,
the only change, it really forecast no new rate hikes but then it has four cuts starting in the late second quarter
and for the Fed funds rate to end at 4.5% at the end of 2024.
And so with all that, our deposit beta, the third component page 18 shows our cycle to-date deposit beta is 27%.
We continue to expect a high-20s total beta by the end of the year. So with that, we would expect deposit costs to
increase 15 basis points to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter. And so with all of that, kind of all those
assumptions baked together, we'd expect NIM to bottom in the fourth quarter somewhere in the 5 basis points
lower, maybe around 3.45% to 3.50%, somewhere in there.
So that's sort of what we're looking for in the fourth quarter. As we look into 2024, based on the Moody's forecast
and our growth assumptions, we'd expect our interest-earning assets to average $41 billion and that our net NIM
would stabilized in the 3.50% to 3.60% range which is really no change to our guidance. If I take a step back and
thinking about 2023 versus 2024, it's been such a volatile year relative to rates and NIMs and other majors and so
on, but it looks like our NIM for the full year 2023 will be in the low 3.60s and 2024 is in the mid-3.50s and we'll
just have a little bit more growth to offset it. So anyway, those are kind of the ways we're thinking about NIM one
quarter out and sort of how we're thinking about it for next year with these assumptions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, that's helpful. And the stability that's created there and I know John spoke this a little bit. Is that − a lot of
that coming from the asset side repricing on that 70% of loans and have you guys given any detail around the
pace of those repricings and kind of when we can kind of ratably see that benefit?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
Sure. I think last quarter we talked about it on the call, but it's roughly about $1 billion a quarter in loan repricing.
So whether $4 billion a year and that step up is around 300 basis points or so. And then, of course, we have
some securities coming in and that's probably $700 million or $800 million, but we'll likely use that to fund loan
growth, so maybe that helps you kind of just frame up. It's about $1 billion a quarter over the next, I don't know,
five, six quarters and it's roughly at 300 basis points to pick up and the yields are somewhere in the [ph] 4.25% to
4.5% (00:13:32) range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And that's the adjustable and fixed repricings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Right. Yeah. Understood. Okay, great. And then I guess lastly for me, any sort of as you think about that
Moody's expectation and we start thinking about presumably some rate cuts. Any kind of high-arching balance
sheet strategies to protect the NIM when rates presumably do go down and anything around the – a potential
bond restructuring? I think the AOCLs maybe near $816 million here today. So I'm just kind of wondering with the
capital build, if that's something you guys are thinking more about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Maybe I'll just – you know, NIM strategy is maybe Will or John can address capital and boundary structure. As we
think about the NIM moving forward, we had an investor recently asked us if Fed funds went down to 3%, what
was your NIM back when Fed funds were 3%? And we did some – I think – rarely to remember, but we look back
at it and it was in the 3.75% to 4% range. So it's just we're waiting for the repricing strategy of all these fixed rate
type loans if our deposit is paying in.
And so, as we think about – we'll do things around the margin, around hedging and those kinds of things. That
won't be a huge strategy for us. But I think the opportunity will be as rates – if rates do fall, if we have four rate
cuts next year, the money markets and those types of things on an incremental margin would fall a little bit. And
then our fixed rate repricing of our loans would continue to reprice up. And so, as we think about the modeling
and as we think about NIM, that's why we sort of are guiding in that range. But why don't I turn it over to Will and
just maybe talk about bond restructuring capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. Stephen, good morning. I'd say we have flexibility, which we like. We've got a strong capital position.
We've got a strong reserve. We've got a good capital formation rate. And as they give us a lot of things to think
about with respect to capital deployment, I mean at current price, our stock's pretty attractive. So certainly
repurchases of some degree is on the table. And additionally, with bond portfolio restructure, while we're not likely
to engage in a wholesale kitchen sink type thing, there's certainly the ability to nibble around the edges. So we
continue to think about all those options as well as some of the growth opportunities afforded to us by turmoil in
our markets and the good economy in which we operate. So we like that flexibility.

Hey. Good morning, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
We have really no change – yeah, no change from our prior guidance. We've seen a couple of these deals
happen, but it's still really, really challenging to get the math to work with the AOCI and the regulatory delay risk.
So our assumption is that things are going to pick up probably the back half of 2024 as we get closer to the
election and there's more certainty in the economy. Clearly, the logic is there for M&A, given the revenue
pressures in the industry. And we're just going to stay out on the street visiting peer banks that possibly could be
partners in the future. But it's challenging in the short run.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then just kind of big-picture earnings question as we think about next year. As you look at – you've got a little
bit, let's call it, stabilization in the margin after we kind of come off a fourth quarter. It seems like you still expect
for there to be a little bit of balance sheet growth. But as you look at revenue growth as compared to expense
7


South State Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
growth, how do you think those two marry each other in 2024? Do you think this is a year where you can still
create positive operating leverage or do you see this as a year where we'll really kind of see revenue and
expense growth kind of be at the same pace or maybe even a little bit more expense growth relative to revenue?
Just curious how you're thinking about that into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Well, Catherine, this is Steve. If you can tell us what the yield curve would look like that'd help. I'm not sure that
we know that. But I do think in the immediate environment, as we think about we've talked about NIM, if we talk
about fee income, that's going to be a bit more challenging, I think in the next quarter or so, just with the 10-year
Treasury rising up. One of the businesses that [indiscernible] (00:18:37) correspondent division and we see with
the 10-year rising, some of the swap opportunities probably aren't there at least in this quarter. And it bounces
around from time to time and so on. So I'd imagine that will eventually come up.
But our range of noninterest income to assets, I think that if you look back at this quarter, we guided to 55 basis
points to 65 basis points. This quarter, we were at 64 basis points so I'd call that the high end. If I looked forward
into the next quarter, I would think we'd be closer to the lower end of that. And then as we think about kind of a
full-year picture of non-interest income, I would expect – I think we've been guiding in that 55 basis points to 65
basis point range. We'll probably end up in the low 60 basis pings to average assets.
And as we think about 2024, I'd expect we would probably start a little lower and then in the higher as the – if the
Moody's consensus is right and the 10-year Treasury goes back towards 4%, we'll start seeing more capital
market activity. So kind of the way I think about it, probably won't be a lot of growth in the non-interest income
year-over-year assuming the Moody's rate forecast. And I would expect that based on the NIM forecast, we just
kind of went through dollar growth. It's probably not going to be [ph] a less (00:20:02). So that's the revenue
picture. [indiscernible] (00:20:05) just talk through the expense picture.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And so, obviously, with that revenue picture, our goal for next year is to be very controlled in our expense
growth. And we're still deep in the planning and budgeting processes as most people are at this point. And the
State – they don't have any precise guidance to give, but we would hope and expect to be in the low to mid-
single-digit range on expense growth and try to control as tightly as we can.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on that last point on
expenses. You guys are in a pretty enviable position from a fundamental standpoint. You guys have been very
conservative, built reserves. I think that's really well taken from my vantage point. You've got capitals growing. I
mean, why not be more aggressive on the expense side now while revenues are under pressure? So you better
positioned yourself as you talked about John at the outset for what will be brighter days at some point. I know
there's a lot of dislocations in the market. I assume there's a lot of good lenders out there that you guys can go
after. Why not actually be more aggressive here on the hiring and organic growth front while you have many
competitors that are capital and liquidity-constrained? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Okay. When I heard you say be aggressive on the expense front, I wasn't sure whether you were cutting
expenses or adding expenses, Michael, but I think you're saying be opportunistic is what you're saying...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
...and, yeah, we would agree with that. And I would tell you that really we're opportunistic all the time. We never
stop recruiting and building the bench strength. I think about our management associate program we've had going
for years where we bring in 35 college interns every summer. We convert 15 to 20 into management associates
every year to build that bench strength on the credit team and on the lending team we're always out recruiting.
Last night my wife and I had dinner with a prospect – a veteran prospect banker and so we're out talking to folks
all the time. And so we're not going to put a number out there on the expense gross side that would keep us from
being opportunistic if that helps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. It now makes complete sense. Just a few smaller ones I noticed that the FHLB was just essentially paid
down, looks like brokered, deposits came down a little bit. What other – I assume broker deposits will come down
as your grow core deposits. What's kind of the right level to think about that? And is there any other tools or
actions you can take on the liability side to kind of contain the creeping interest bearing liability costs? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Michael it's Steve you'll remember in March when we had sort of the banking turmoil, we went ahead and
did a brokerage offering, I think it was a $1.2 billion or so. And then we also borrowed $900 million of Federal
Home Loan Bank and that was just sort of an abundance of caution with all the turmoil going on. And what you've
seen over the last couple of quarters is, one, we've paid off the $900 million of Federal Home Loan Bank as
worries have died down and then the broker CDs are starting to roll off. So we typically – right now, I think our
brokered CD's around 3% of our deposits, give or take. I could see that coming down a little bit, but I wouldn't – it
wouldn't be an abnormal level for us to be around 3% of broker deposits. It could go lower, but it wouldn't be an
unusual on that for us to stay, hang out in that general range.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yes. So our new loan production yield for the third quarter was around 7.40%. I think it's a little over that, 7.42%
on the new funded yield. It is a little higher than that in September. I don't think we have the September margin
numbers, but I think it was – for the most of the quarter, it was not all that far different from our ending quarter, but
a few basis points here or there. And the margin moves obviously a few basis points on 30 days versus 31 and so
on. But it was reasonably stable most of the quarter.

peeling back the onion, just curious your recent reviews of borrower financials. Anything that's standing out from a
credit deterioration perspective that maybe not be – not showing up in the numbers, but areas where you're
pulling back from are being a little bit more cautious on these days?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Dave, the pipelines are trending down. I mean, I think the Fed is getting what they wanted with
liquidity being tight. I think borrowers are more cautious. Banks are more cautious. So we anticipate for the
industry that pipelines will shrink. Now, the interesting part is I think the loan growth will be a little bit disconnected
from the pipeline trends. While pipeline trends will be going down and probably new loan production will be going
down, payoffs have screeched to a halt, and there's still some funding that the loan production that we did the last
couple of years. So, I think that we're going to see probably mid-single digit kind of loan growth continue, but it will
be on lower production levels than we've had in the past.
But like from a credit standpoint, we've talked about in the past the areas that that we see having the most stress
in the short-term is probably small business, SBA kind of loans. The Assisted Living space just never really
recovered from COVID and they continue to face labor pressures. And yeah, everybody's talking about office.
We think we're going in and our loan review team is being very conservative and forward-looking on how we're
looking at grading loans. And so, I think it's forcing the conversations with borrowers in advance of maturities,
which is the way it should work. So anyway, that gives you some picture of our sense of where the credit risks are
and where the production trends are headed.

Hey. I just wanted to clarify something on the expenses real quick. Will, did you say – you said mid-240s. Is that
accurate?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2023
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. It's in the – mid – the exact middle point of that would be $245 million. That's the mid-240s I was
referencing. Sorry, I wasn't more clear.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, no, no. I just want to make sure because the live transfer picked up mid-220s which...

And let me also clarify, I should point out that it does not include, of course, the FDIC special assessment, which
has not – if it gets finalized this quarter, we'll all be booking up in Q4. And for us that's around $25 million. But
that's not in those numbers, obviously.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. On the portfolio restructure, you said that you're not going to do the whole kitchen sink, maybe a
nibble around the edges. I guess what does nibbling around the edges look like in terms of size? And I guess
maybe the securities that are coming due more near term that maybe have lower loss content to them, like are
there – is there a size of a portion of the portfolio that's maybe lower-yielding that's maybe coming due at some
point in the next 12 months that you could look to punt on that could generate some reasonable EPS accretion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Brody. This is Steve. As we thought about it and continue to monitor and think about it, I think the – as we're
thinking about like size, I don't think it would be certainly not more than 15% probably 10% or so the available –
excuse me, of the investment portfolio book. That would be something to look at. And then, I guess, as we think
about EPS accretion to earn back all that would be anything else we do on the capital side, we would want that
earn-back to come within three years.
So I think as we think about the whole options on the table relative to capital, whether – as Will mentioned, the
buyback, whether it's bond restructure, whether it's growth, whether it's M&A, we're thinking about them inside the
same lens. Of course, on a bond restructure, you have less execution risk. But at the same time, there's other
pieces and parts that we're looking at from a capital management. And I'm really glad that we're in a position
where capital has grown over the last year. The earnings – the PPNR earnings have been really good and the
loan loss provisions have been socked away. So I think we're in a good position to have some flexibility.

Got it. Okay. I appreciate that. And then, on the buyback I'm just trying to think about willingness to be maybe
more aggressive just given where the share price is, it wasn't that long ago. I think it was last year, you bought
back some pretty decent slug of stock. We're pretty well below it. We're pretty well below where that was. And so
just given the capital generation and the stock price today, I guess, what would you think would be the right level
of buybacks to think about moving forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Look, there's no gun to our head to do anything immediately, but the stock price we think is attractive and
we are generating capital. So stock buybacks or day by day thing when you're looking at the economy and you're
looking at credit potential risk, but right now the price looks pretty attractive to us I don't think if the time and the
cycle to do any kind of wholesale major move, but back to nibbling around the edges, it looks okay where it is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. I think you gave this SNC portfolio percentage in the deck. I think − I thought it was like 2%. Do you
happen to have what the − of that what you guys are lead on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Brody. Just not a meaningful part of what we do at 2% of our portfolio, but we typically did not lead.
Typically, when we're in these credits, these are credits that follow middle market bankers that we've hired from
Bank of America, Wells and Truist. So in many cases, the banker that works for us used to lead the credit, but
because we're trying to manage hold limits, normally, we're just taking a piece of the credit. So, I think out of 39
relationships, we only lead 1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then I just want to clarify, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier in the call, but just on the swap
revenue. I think you guys have been pretty clear that you should expect correspondent to have some kind of ups
and down − up and down quarters here with the swap income. Is this more of the level that you would expect in
the current interest rate environment going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Brody. This is Steve. It does bounce around a lot and you can see that in the quarterly numbers. A lot of
times in the correspond division, we'll have other things that offset it. But just to frame that up on page 32 of our
deck is our non-interest income kind of trend in the last, I don't know, I guess it's five quarters. And you can kind
of see it, our non-interest income to asset sort of bounces around. It's been as high as 69 basis points. It's been
low as 57 basis point of assets.
So as the 10-year Treasury from June 30 to call it now, the 10-year Treasury is not quite up 1% to close. That has
an effect on our capital markets team, at least in the short run, the pipelines, until everybody kind of gets used to
it. So I would expect, like I said, that our non-interest income to assets this next quarter would still be in 64 basis
point, would be closer down to the lower end of the guide, 55 basis points. We've been guiding 55 basis point to
60 basis point, they'd be in the short and a little bit lower. And then as we think about next year and you look at
the Moody's consensus, it looks like the 10-year Treasury starts coming down towards 4% toward the end of next
13

year. My sense would be that those quarters would get more favorable towards that particular division and we
kind of rebound. So, yeah. Kind of looks – it will get a little lumpy from quarter-to-quarter sometimes, but from a
standpoint of looking at the overall picture, that would be how I'd look at it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe for John. Just to follow-up on Catherine's question on the M&A, ONB
bought CapStar or announced they're buying CapStar last night and it seemed like a pretty reasonable well-priced
deal, some solid accretion. And the stock is actually mildly outperforming today, which is nice to see. So, when
you kind of see investors may be happier about a well-priced acquisition that doesn't come with too much dilution,
does that maybe make you think about wanting to do something sooner rather than later despite the current rate
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
I mean, it's a case by-case basis, Brody. So we're open for business. And if the right opportunity came along
sooner rather than later, we would pursue it. I think it's just going to be few and far between over the next couple
quarters. Anything's possible, so I wouldn't rule it out. I just think if I was forecasting, I think I think activity for the
industry is going to be more robust second half of 2024. But we're not opposed to it if something attractive and
accretive to our franchise came along.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then just my last one, we talked about this, I think, on the first quarter call. And I know, again, it's a
very small loan portfolio for you guys. But I'm more interested in it just from a commentary perspective than I am
necessarily [ph] a sales base (00:36:27) specific perspective. But the substandard [indiscernible] (00:36:31)
portion of the nursing home portfolio keeps going up. Is there anything different than what we talked about last
time, which I think was costs keep going up, maybe some of the third-party payers aren't paying out as much? I'm
just trying to think, is there anything kind of unique to Senior Housing right now that's kind of driving some of that
weakness because you're seeing it elsewhere at other banks as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I talk to our credit team specifically about that. But as you point out, it's less than 1% of our loan portfolio.
But, really, it comes down to the labor. I think that's the biggest issue right now. Probably labor, the nursing
shortage, you hear about some of the rates that traveling nurses get and then interest costs going up. And so
you've got two major expense headwinds and then you still go the revenue headwinds following COVID about
people's desire to be in a nursing home post COVID. But the main issue, Brody, is the nursing shortage and the
labor costs.

Awesome. Thank you very much for the color. I appreciate it, guys. Have a good rest of the day.
