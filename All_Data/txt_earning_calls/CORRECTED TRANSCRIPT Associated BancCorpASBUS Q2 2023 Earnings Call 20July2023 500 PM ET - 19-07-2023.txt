Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Alicia, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Andy
Harmening. I am joined once again by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit
Officer. I'll start by sharing some highlights for the quarter and from there, Derek will provide update on margin,
income trends, and capital. And then Pat will share an update on credit.
So midway through the year, we've started to see some renewed stability through the banking system, and that's
especially true here in the Midwest. Unemployment rates in most of our states remain below the national average.
The consumer remains healthy, and our business customers continue to seek ways to expand and optimize their
operations where it makes sense.
And with that stability as our backdrop, we've continued to make progress with our plan to attract, deepen, and
retain customer relationships; optimize our balance sheet; and enhance our profitability profile over time. You can
see it in our loan portfolios where we've continued to add significant volumes of high-quality consumer and
commercial loans to our books. You can see it on the deposit side where we're deepening relationships with our
Mass Affluent Strategy and acquiring new relationships, the brand-new brand campaign and multiple product and
service enhancements. And you can see it in digital where we've already made several upgrades to the new
platform we launched less than a year ago, leading to an increased customer satisfaction score and a decreased
customer attrition rate.
We have become a company that has developed an ability to execute even amid a volatile quarter in banking. But
importantly, we've reached these milestones without sacrificing our foundational discipline on credit quality and
expense management. We look forward to carrying the momentum into the back half of this year. So with that, I'd
like to highlight key results for the second quarter on slide 2.
Our second quarter results reflected the continued expansion of our balance sheet, stable credit trends, and
progress against our initiatives. We added loan balances in all three major segments again in the second quarter,
led by C&I and auto finance. However, as we discussed a quarter ago, lending activity as a whole has slowed
from the strong pace we saw in 2022.
To fund our growth and enhance our liquidity profile, we tapped the wholesale markets to increase deposits by
$1.7 billion during the quarter. This reliance on wholesale funding sources is expected to dissipate over time as
we begin to realize the full impact of our customer acquisition and relationship-deepening initiatives.
With the increased funding costs impacting the entire industry, our net interest margin came in at 2.8%, which is
down from our fourth quarter peak, but is still 9 basis points above the same period a year ago. As a partial offset
to margin pressures, we saw noninterest income increase by $3 million from the prior quarter, helping us deliver
PTPP income of $133 million for the quarter, a $23 million increase from the same period a year ago.
We are continuing to monitor asset quality closely, but our credit trends remain relatively stable during the second
quarter. We saw 15 basis points of net charge-offs during the quarter and added 1 basis point of ACLL. We added
$22 million in provision for the quarter, but still matched our net income available to common equity from the
same period a year ago.
Now, staying on the topic of credit, like to take a moment to reiterate a few important points about who we are as
a company on slide 3. We take an active, disciplined, and conservative approach to credit. This includes an
ongoing and deep review of existing portfolios and in addition, our efforts to de-risk our balance sheet over the

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
past 14 years have put us in a relative position of strength. Since 2009, we've taken steps to exit high-risk
portfolios, replace those balances with lower risk asset classes and implement processes and procedures to
identify and eliminate risk. And today, we're squarely focused on prime/super prime consumers, core commercial
lending, and a diversified balance sheet.
This broad focus has protected us from overextending ourselves in any one particular area and limited our
exposure in at-risk subcategories such as CRE office. We also benefit from operating primarily in stable,
conservative Midwestern markets that don't see the big swings you might see in other parts of the country. As
mentioned previously, this long-held disciplined approach on credit has also given us the flexibility to continue to
execute on our strategic initiatives in the face of a dynamic operating environment. With that, I'd like to provide
some details on our loan trends on slide 4.
During the second quarter, we continue to add high-quality loans to the balance sheet in areas such as C&I and
auto finance. We've now reported growth in each major segment for five consecutive quarters. And while we've
continued to book loans, the pace of new deals coming into the pipeline has slowed as our customers take a
more cautious approach in the uncertain macro environment.
Within our portfolio, we continue to emphasize selective growth in high-quality loan categories that help us
diversify our portfolio while delivering an enhanced profitability profile. Over the last seven quarters, the expansion
of our C&I business and growth in our new equipment finance and asset-based lending verticals has helped us
expand our offerings and sharpen our focus on high-quality, relationship- based lending. This enables us to de-
emphasize lower yielding non-relationship asset classes such as third-party originated mortgage.
As we announced back in Q1, we've chosen to exit this low-margin business with relatively low relationship value.
We originated approximately $1 billion of these loans in 2022 and we now expect to originate just $60 million in
2023 as we wind down this business to focus on other areas that enable us to optimize our returns over time. So
in summary, we remain confident in our ability to drive high- quality accretive growth on our balance sheet and as
such, we continue to expect loan growth of between 6% and 8% in 2023.
On slide 5, we highlight our funding trends for the second quarter. During the quarter, we tapped the wholesale
and broker deposit markets to help enhance our liquidity profile, fund our loan growth, and replace higher cost
FHLB advances. These actions were temporary in nature, not intended to be part of our long-term strategy.
Within our core customer deposit base, we did see some short-term volatility from a subset of uninsured
businesses, business deposits, and public funds in March and April. But that volatility largely dissipated by the
end of the quarter and in the face of this challenging environment, we actually saw modest growth in our
consumer deposit base during the quarter. The stabilization reflects the granularity of our deposit base and our
recent efforts to attract and deepen customer relationships with digital tools and product enhancements.
We expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in check as we move through the back half of the year and
we remain confident in our ability to fund our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our initiatives.
With that said, based on current market conditions, we now expect total core customer deposits to decrease by
3% for the year. However, we expect to drive growth of 2% in the back half of the year as we continue to execute
on our initiatives.
On slide 6, we're sharing additional details on our initiatives designed to acquire deep and retain customer
relationships. We've continued to see promising signs of progress with these efforts. We've actually seen

momentum pick up as we move through the year. As I mentioned previously, we're up and running with a variety
of initiatives across the bank, and we've seen several leading indicators that give us confidence we are on track.
First, in one of the most challenging environments for regional banks in years, we actually grew net consumer and
business households during all three months of the second quarter. Secondly, we've implemented several
enhancements to our product and service offerings and launched a new brand campaign, which resulted in 11%
increase in consumer household acquisition rates and a 13% decrease in attrition year-over-year. Third, I want to
remind you that the new digital platform we launched last fall was built with open architecture, enabling us to
quickly respond to customer feedback and deliver more and more frequent upgrades.
Since launching the platform 10 months ago, we've already successfully released nine upgrades. As a result,
we've seen a strong positive trend in our [ph] top box, (00:11:12) completely satisfied customer satisfaction
scores. And most recently, during the second quarter, our satisfaction scores hit a three-year high in mobile
banking.
Finally, since launching a new Mass Affluent Strategy to deepen relationships with high potential customers,
we've already added over $300 million in net new deposits and surpassed our full year goal. This growth
represents a roughly 8% increase from our pre-launch baseline. As you can see, we're bringing in new dollars and
deepening relationships with a customer base that is more satisfied. While we're pleased with initial results of
these efforts, we've yet to realize the full impact of the initiatives, and we're working on additional enhancements
as we speak. What's not going to change, though, is our commitment to the foundational strength of our company,
which is maintaining discipline with regards to credit risk, expense management and operational risk
management.
So finally, on slide 7, our team once again paired strong revenues with diligent expense management during the
second quarter. And despite facing – despite the challenges facing the industry during the quarter, our company
delivered PTPP income of $133 million, which represented a 21% increase as compared to the same period a
year ago. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage during 2023.
So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a little more detail on
our margin, income statement and capital trends for the quarter.

Thanks, Andy. Starting on slide 8, I'll begin by highlighting our asset and liability rate trends through the second
quarter. Our total asset yields have continued to rise due to rising rates and floating rate nature of our large
segment of our loan book. Since the start of the rate cycle, total earning asset yields have increased by 259 basis
points or roughly 53% of the increase in Fed funds target rate over the same period. Our commercial and CRE
portfolios, largely comprised of floating rate loans, have seen the largest increase.
On the liability side, rising rates and the volatility impacting the industry this spring have combined to put
additional pressure on funding costs across the industry. Here at Associated interest-bearing liability costs have
now increased by 279 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021 or roughly 50% of the move in Fed funds
target. While the general S-curve effect we expected to see on deposit betas has played out largely as we
expected, our beta accelerated following the volatility we saw in the spring, our short-term build and wholesale
network funding, and the ongoing mix shift away from noninterest bearing deposits. Accordingly, our interest-
bearing deposit beta has now climbed to roughly 52% since the start of the rate cycle.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Moving to slide 9, mix shift and other funding cost pressures combined to drive a 27-basis point compression in
our NIM for the second quarter. Nonetheless, our NIM still represented a 9-basis point increase from the same
period a year ago. On a dollar NII basis, we saw similar impacts during the quarter, yet still delivered dollar NII
that reflected a 19% increase from the same period a year ago. And as Andy discussed, we continue to take
significant actions on both sides of the balance sheet to drive more durable margin over time.
One example is that we've gradually layered in swaps over the past several quarters to decrease our asset
sensitivity and enhance the durability of our margin. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic
picture and the likelihood of a higher for longer scenario, we did not add additional swaps during the second
quarter. Nonetheless, we've continued to see our estimated NII sensitivity come down gradually by design.
The macro outlook remains uncertain. Our current expectations assume one additional 25-basis point Fed funds
increase in September, with no rate cuts in 2023. Based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth,
deposit betas and Fed action, we now expect net interest income growth of between 10% and 12% in 2023. As a
reminder, we do not intend to call the peak on interest rate environment in 2023, but we do – but we will continue
to take reasonable steps over time to dampen our asset sensitivity and manage our downside risk.
On slide 10, we've continued to manage our securities book in the second quarter to align with our 18% to 20%
target. Throughout the past year, the yield on our investments has steadily risen with the rate environment, but we
reined in durations to reduce our longer-term rate risk. After adjusting our CET1 capital ratio to include the
impacts of AOCI, this impact would have represented an 88-basis point hit to CET1 in the second quarter. This
impact is up slightly from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the rebound in rates from the decrease at the end of
March.
As a percentage of total assets, our investment security and cash positions were maintained at roughly 20%
during the quarter. We continue to target investments to total assets of between 18% to 20% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 11, noninterest income grew by $3 million in the second quarter, despite the ongoing pressure
from market-driven headwinds and customer-friendly fee adjustments that we've faced in the past several
quarters. The largest contributing factor for the increase was the moderate growth in mortgage banking income
driven by higher MSR values. We also saw modest growth in card-based wealth management and other fee-
based revenues. These increases were partially offset by decreases in service charges, BOLI Income and asset
gains.
Despite the quarterly increase in noninterest income, we continue to expect total 2023 noninterest income to track
between 8% and 10% versus 2022. As we've discussed, this anticipated compression is driven by current market
dynamics and moderation of deposit account fee income due to customer-friendly overdrafts NSF changes made
in the back half of 2022. These proactive changes gave us additional confidence in our ability to strengthen our
low cost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability profile in 2023 and beyond.
Moving to slide 12, our second quarter expenses increased by 2% versus the prior quarter, amid ongoing
investments to support our initiatives. Our FTE efficiency ratio rose to 57% during the quarter, but it remained 284
basis points below the same period a year ago. Additionally, our noninterest expense base continues to decrease
as a percent of average assets and is now down 15 basis points from the same period last year.
While we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations in 2023, we are committed to keeping
expense growth below revenue growth over the long term. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to pursue

opportunities to optimize our expense base where possible. With that in mind, we now expect total noninterest
expense growth of between 3% and 4% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 13, we continue to prioritize paying a competitive dividend and funding organic growth while
managing capital levels towards our target ranges. During the second quarter, our regulatory capital ratios grew
versus the prior quarter and versus prior year-end 2022. We remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look
out over the remainder of the year. Given current market conditions and the expectation for short-term rates to
remain elevated in the near term, we continue to expect TCE to land between 6.75% and 7.25% by year end and
CET1 to land between 9% and 9.5%.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.

Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start on slide 14 with an update on our allowance trends. We utilized the Moody's May
2023 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains
consistent with recent observed trends and assumes an additional near-term rate hike, GDP growth rates similar
to the first half of 2023, a cooling labor market and a deceleration of inflation. At the end of the second quarter,
our ACLL landed at $377 million. This figure represents an $11 million increase from the prior quarter, as
allowance continues to be driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth, nominal credit movement, and reflects
general macroeconomic trends benefiting from stability in the Midwest. Accordingly, our reserves to loan ratio
increased 1 basis point from 1.25% to 1.26% during the quarter.
Moving to slide 15, our quarterly credit trends remained stable across the portfolio during the second quarter. We
did see nonperforming assets, nonaccrual loans, delinquencies and charge-offs increased slightly during the
quarter, but we view these increases as a sign of both normalization back to pre-pandemic levels, as well as
some one-off situations, as opposed to an indication of a broader issue in the portfolio.
We added another $22 million in provision during the second quarter, which is consistent with the past three
quarters. As mentioned, this provision build was largely a function of loan growth, limited credit movement and
some macro trends. Given recent volatility in the industry, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate that the recent
growth in our loan portfolios continues to focus on our core business, growth of key relationships, and expanding
our engagement with familiar customer segments. Our experienced team continues to adhere to a disciplined
underwriting culture and a proactive approach to portfolio management that we have solidified over the past 10-
plus years when the bank worked to de-risk the portfolio.
We remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects
elevated inflation, supply chain disruption, labor cost, to name just a few, economic concerns. In addition, we
continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including the
ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments to reflect
changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes and other indications of credit quality.
Finally, on slide 16, Andy discussed previously that our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over
the course of the past several years, as we've built a diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial loans across the
bank and a focus on prime and super prime consumer portfolio.
While CRE has frequently been cited as an area of risk in the media, our approach to CRE lending reflects the
conservative approach we've applied across the bank. In building our CRE portfolio, we focused on partnering

with well-known developers in stable Midwest markets. Over two-thirds of our CRE portfolio is based in the
Midwest, with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties.
Office loans represent just 3.5% of our total loans as a bank, and within that portfolio, we are weighted towards
suburban Class A properties. While we continue to monitor this portfolio closely, we feel well-positioned given our
business model approach and the markets we operate in.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.

Thanks, Pat. I'd like to reiterate a couple points from the presentation on slide 17. First, based on the resiliency of
our markets and the ongoing momentum with our lending initiatives, we remain confident in our ability to drive
high-quality loan growth throughout the year. As such, we continue to expect total period-end loan growth of
between 6% and 8% in 2023.
Secondly, while we see that our core deposits have stabilized, we now expect core customer deposits to shrink by
3% for the year. Well, with that said, we also remain confident in our initiatives on the deposit side based on
several leading indicators that point to momentum in the back half of the year. With this in mind, we expect to see
positive core customer deposit growth of 2% in the second half of the year.
Shifting to revenue, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed
action, following unique events of the spring. We now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between
10% and 12% in 2023.
And finally, we continue to invest strategically in both people and technology, but our disciplined approach to
expenses remains foundational. We also remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage as a
company. As a result, we've lowered our expense guidance to between 3% and 4% growth for the year.
So with that, let's open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will be now conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hi, Dan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I guess, first, just on the funding side, I think I heard you say this, I think it was Andy, that the wholesale and
network transaction deposits are expected to be stable in the back half of the year. Just correct if I'm wrong in
that. But I was just hoping to get kind of a sense into – if that's wrong expectation for how that – how those were
fluctuated. It's just – if there's a loan to deposit target that you're hoping to keep or if there's the levels that you
don't want to go above related to those funding sources. And then, just kind of trends within the second quarter in
terms of the core deposits that gave you confidence in being able to grow in the back half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Maybe I'll start that one out and then turn it over to Derek. One of our absolute imperatives in the second
quarter is to ensure that we had a strong liquidity position, which we do. So, we wanted to make sure that our day
one liquidity position was in a good place for the bank in an uncertain time. Since that period of time, we've been
able to see that our uninsured, uncollateralized deposits are down to 21%. We've seen that we have day one
coverage of well over 100%. And we've seen – we have seen the stability of our deposit base emerge in the
month-by-month as we've come through this, whatever you want to call this four-month period of time we
just came through.
With regards to loan to deposit ratio, because we know that we have a stability in our deposit base right now,
we've stated that we wanted to be in the 90% to 95% range. Because we took a bit of a conservative approach, in
my opinion, an appropriate approach to liquidity, we actually lowered our loan to deposit ratio in the second
quarter. And so, we're well within the range. We don't have to add to that on the high cost deposit front in order to
maintain it. And to me, there's a, finally, an emergence of a deposit trend that we think we have a much better
view into as we head into the second half of the year.
Derek, do you want to take any of the rest of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think only – the way to connect the dots on the guidance and what Andy just shared is if we got 6% to 8%
loan growth for the year and we've gotten 4%, a little over 4% from that since December already, you could see

us consuming that 2% customer deposit growth in the back half of the year to fund the low end of our range. I
think if we had good quality lending relationships, we wouldn't rule out adding to that funding with additional
wholesale. I think the point we want to make, though, is that we've seen stability at the back half of the quarter
and our core customer deposits and we're confident about being able to grow that, and that the impact that we've
seen on our margin from the disruption is largely behind us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Right. I appreciate all that color. I guess as we think about the NII guidance that you gave, typically kind of
thinking about that from a margin perspective, and this relates to NII as well, but just curious to get your thoughts
on maybe the cadence of the margin over the next few quarters. Just your thoughts on when that might bottom.
And a clarification within that, I may have misheard you, but I thought you said you're assuming a rate hike in
September. Is – was that supposed to be July or – so just – those things with a quick clarification. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, the – when we did our forecast, rates had – were a little bit softer and we did assume a September
increase. That's moved forward a little bit. We do think, again, as I just stated, most of our margin pressure is
behind us. Our outlook and our NII guidance for the rest of year contemplates a margin in the range of 2.80% to
2.70%. So, we think that stabilization is helpful and that's not what our outlook suggests.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'd just expand on that, Daniel, by saying we think we'll support a big portion of loan growth in the second half with
the deposit growth that we're going to have. We are asset sensitive and expect that we will have some benefit to
the rate increase, and we can pretty clearly see what that will be.
On the deposit side, there could be some modest deposit mix shift continue and – for the rest of the year, and if
we need to get any wholesale funding, we'll factor that in. So when we believe that we won't call the very bottom
on margin, I think that would be too bold. But we definitely see a more clear path right now than we saw 90 days
ago. And barring any extraordinary industrywide news that we've had each of the first two quarters of the year, we
do think that we're in the range of the bottom.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just lastly, just related to that, the – on the rate hike date, if we do get it in July as the [ph] the feeders
(00:31:30) are expecting here rather than September, would you think it would have much impact on the
guidance, maybe push you a little bit towards the higher end of the range – I'm sorry, the lower end of the range
for NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I don't think we've ever – our level of precision is that high. Part of our NII guidance includes rate of growth
on the earning assets. So it could be helpful, but I don't think the resolution is that high.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed
with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks. It's just following up on the funding, I guess, first, when – Derek, when you said the margin 2.70% to
2.80%, is that your view for the full year or is that for the second half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
That's for the second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then, when we look at the funding outlook, it's good to hear that you feel encouraged that there's
opportunity for growth. I guess what's driving that optimism for consumer deposit growth? Is it just you can put a
rate out there and that will attract money or is this a more full relationship? I guess as we look at that growth, is
that all going to come in the form of CDs or do you think that there's opportunity to attract relationships? And
should we think that the DDA level has sort of fund the core here as a percentage of deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. All good questions, and it's not a one thing for us. We started, as you know, several prongs to this. I would
focus on mobile satisfaction. We know it's the most visited site we have. And so, when you increase your
satisfaction there, what you look for immediately is a decrease in attrition. We've seen a double-digit of decrease
in attrition. And by the way, that's during a very volatile second quarter. So, that's one indicator of what we've had.
We've seen growth in our customer base on consumer and business each of the last three months.
We have seen a growth in our core commercial outside of government banking. The government banking dollars
that we've seen run off have typically been collateralized low margin deals, and that's over $300 million. We had
an extraordinary one customer take $300 million. That was a higher yielding customer. But when you put those
two things together, those, we believe, are extraordinary events that frankly, we aren't in a position to incur. And
that's why we've seen that stability happen in May and June. We see it halfway through the month of July as well.
And so, when you pair customer satisfaction, when you pair that with customer growth, you do expect to get
operating accounts with that.
We are getting better and better at deepening relationships on the commercial side. That will be important for us
the rest of this year, next year and the following year. If we want to add to those categories, which we may, we

know how to deepen relationships now and that will give us confidence on the go forward. So the answer is no, it
won't be all CDs. We are subject to the mix shift that's occurring in the marketplace, but we can see very clearly
that that mix shift has slowed in the last two months. And so, we expect that to temper a bit each of the
subsequent months as the year goes along.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, okay. So then, when we look at DDA as a percentage of total here of, what, 20.5%, is this a floor or do you
think we could still see that go lower from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I couldn't call that a floor, but I absolutely do not believe you'll see the pace that you saw in the previous two
quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, as we look out a little further into 2024 and when some of these broker deposits come due, do
you feel that the momentum that you just described earlier will be enough to be able to replace those with home
grown deposits or we should be thinking that brokered CD levels stay at these levels for more of an indefinite
period of time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think it's going to depend both on how much we want to grow the balance sheet and what the business
mix is of the assets that we're putting on because we think we still have continued opportunity to optimize our
yields that way. I would not expect that as a percent of our balance sheet to grow disproportionately. So, we do
expect that the consumer side of the business will provide significant funding. And so, the mix would be the same
or decrease from where it is now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just finally for me, in the past, you talked about the optionality of the auto program being able to
sort of ramp that up and ramp it down, and you had growth this quarter. Would that be a lever you would use to
offset either better than expected deposit flows or weaker than expected deposit flows or is that sort of the place
you should be looking at and making up slack or giving some opportunity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We're not going to double down on auto and increase that rate to the point that it becomes too heavily
concentrated. However, the idea all along is that we could decrease our reliance on third-party originated
mortgages, which are – have a less significant yield and are a non-relationship play. We're seeing very good
yields on the auto book as we're going along right now. They're also not one that's likely to refinance if you see
rates go down in 12 months. So, that puts us in a pretty decent position as well. What you will see from us, so I
see those two as a bit of a tradeoff, the third-party originated mortgages and auto. Over time then, we've got to –

we will dissect the balance sheet and look at expanding businesses that we've had some success in. We will look
at that right now and come up with a plan heading into year-end on that.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to go back to the NII discussion for just a
second. It sounds like a little bit more margin erosion but at a much slower pace than certainly this quarter. I
guess even if the margin hasn't bottomed, I think the updated guidance implies that the second half NII will have
to average something around $7 million or so higher than the second quarter run rate. So, I guess what you're
saying is that there's enough loan or any asset growth overall to overwhelm any further margin erosion. So, is the
right conclusion that the second quarter was – that we just witnessed the trough for NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think we'll leave that – I think if you do the math, if that's what you're coming up with, we'll let it at that. I think
we've got a range of growth on the asset side that is pretty good. And if we think that comes in lighter, then we've
got options to be more efficient on the funding side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. And then, Andy, just wanted to discuss, I guess, in a bit more detail just sort of the tactical
thinking on your appetite to lend. Your biggest competitors, presumably they're going to be subject to this whole
host of new capital and liquidity rules. So, the biggest guys seem to be pulling back on lending. Are there any
areas where you guys similarly are pulling back in light of economic uncertainty or by – I know you touched on a
little in your opening remarks in specific areas, but by contrast, with the larger banks pulling back, any areas
where you think you can take some market share if the pricing is good and your competitors are pulling back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. That's a good question. You asked two different questions within there, I think, Scott. I think one was with
regards to capital, and I think you mentioned economic uncertainty. What I would take first is the economic
uncertainty, and tell you that we want to lend to people that can pay us back. And I know that sounds pretty basic,
but when you look at almost 99% of our auto book being prime and super prime on the origination side, when you
see the loan to value go down and the FICO go modestly up even above around 780, I believe, in the last quarter,
we are looking at a pretty squeaky clean book. But in that place, there's some people that have pulled back there.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
We are dealing with prime, super prime borrowers and we're getting a yield above 7%. So, this seems like a pretty
good move for us. So, I'd say that's exactly what is happening in that area.
We looked at our third-party originated mortgages, and in the markets that we're in, the yield we're getting was
substantially less than that. And our history has been that that book churns. When rates go down, they
immediately go down with it. And so, that would be one example of an area that we will see over time. That shift
will be beneficial to us.
We're going to focus heavily on relationship businesses. We are now proving within our commercial book that we
can grow our core commercial deposits. That will matter a great deal to us over time. We haven't broken that out
publicly but I see the trends on that. And in this year, when you're positive in that space, you're on to something.
So, we will continue to try to look at that as a source for us to look at lower cost deposits, lower than wholesale-
funded, lower than FHLB-funded, lower than government, high rate government deposits. So, there are a few
areas that are emerging for us because we've gotten into asset-based lending, equipment finance and enhanced
our commercial approach to business.
And then, finally, I'd say just acquiring customers through, vis-à-vis, digital and mobile banking, we're seeing the
percentage of customers coming through on our brand advertising campaign through digital increasing. They are
modest in incremental numbers because we're testing and learning and making sure they're not falling off on the
back side. So, it's a lot of the things that we've talked about. And the answer is yes, we do believe that we have
opportunities in the marketplace.
That being said, we don't expect anything like the growth that we saw in previous – in the previous year and 2022.
But that was by design to increase your capabilities so that you can continue to land in the higher return areas as
you de-emphasize some of the lower return areas.
With regards to capital, we feel like we're in a pretty good position as we create that shift in what we're lending on.
That, of course, you increase your capital vis-à-vis profitability and right now we don't see a constraint on capital
based on the way that we're approaching it, de-emphasizing some lower yield, emphasizing some higher yield.
So we do think – and with regards to regulatory, we're early innings. We've heard quotes from the OCC and seen
those out there and seen that they thought it probably would be a big emphasis on the over $100 billion banks.
But it's a little too early to comment, I think, on what that's going to mean to the banks above us in size.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hey, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
The forward curve is implying lower rates next year. So as I look at your $6 billion of brokered CDs and other time
deposits, what's the repricing opportunity over the next kind of 12 or within 2024 with the assumption that rates
are lower? Do you have a schedule – a maturity schedule on when those roll?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We don't but let me give you some color. All of our brokered CD programs were largely within 12 months.
So think of 12-month term as the outside limit and then we scheduled both depending on price and volume and
appetite, either nine months, six months or shorter than that. And we start out very short [indiscernible] (00:44:56).
And then if you think about our specials for retail, it's largely centered on the seven-month CD. So we had a
couple other maturities, but our most popular that we've been with the last couple months is seven months. So we
think of – most of this all repricing between now and mid next year, the majority of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And can you remind me the network transaction deposits, that's 100% beta product?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe last question. I don't want to overlook slide 6, Andy, when you talked about the net growth
and some of the deposit products. Maybe can you talk about on the consumer side, are you getting – are you the
primary bank in this relationship? How are average deposits looking? And maybe expand a little bit on these new
businesses and households that are partnering with Associated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So I'll give the example of the mass affluent. The mass affluent is a segment where a large percentage of
the deposits reside and so I mean, that is a primary deepening play within those within your existing customer
base. But then it's also with new accounts that come in.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
So when you look at that category for us, what I'd seen coming into the bank was that we had an opportunity to
deepen on the mass affluent side. We had an opportunity to deepen on the commercial side. I would say that
those efforts are just happening right now.
Now, it was almost impossible to see that in the second quarter of this year because of the extraordinary events
that we had, which is exactly why I created page 6 because we see the trends behind the trends as the dust
settles, as the noise goes away. So the idea on these is absolutely get activity coming into your bank but with that
activity, put products and services in there and give your people an opportunity to talk about that on the consumer
side. That's what segmentation does on the consumer side.
On the commercial side, it is simple things like tracking of your pipeline and incenting for your pipeline. And our
people have gotten better and better at that conversation. In fact, I see the early indicator. I saw the early indicator
90 days ago in our Treasury Management sales. That is not where you'll make or break the bank from a revenue
standpoint, but it's an indication that you're having conversations on things that matter to the customer with
regards their liquidity. And when you have those conversations, you're typically able to deepen. We've seen that
deepening follow from that.
The other question comes up, do you want customer growth or do you want deposit growth? And the answer we
have here is yes.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Yeah. That's a great question. People stay for a lot of different reasons. It's great when you're nice. It's also great
when you're nice. It's really nice when you actually have a digital experience, which is the most used channel and
then it's really good when you have products and services they want and need and they start to deepen.
And so when we launched our new digital platform, you always take a step back in satisfaction. It's just annoying
to change but we've rebounded from that really quickly. In my experience, it usually takes six months. We started
to see rebounding in 90 days. That was awesome. So once we did that, we're starting to get back to our previous
levels, but then people actually use it and they liked it.
And so when they like it, we saw our brand satisfaction going up with the mass affluent. The mass affluent lets us
speak to people in a language and what matters to you when they answer that, we match them up with the
product or service, they leave satisfied. They don't walk out the door. Your first year attrition improves.
When you get most of your people dealing with the channel they like and by the way, we've had 100% uptime on
our digital channel since we launched it. We've not been down. This is what we promised when we went to this
cloud-based solution and we've delivered on that. The number one thing somebody wants is when they pull out
their phone and they log in, they want to see their balance and they do not want the system to be down. We've
delivered that. So as they're more satisfied, we haven't given them as many reasons to leave or we've given them
more reasons to stay. So that's a pretty encouraging view on our side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. Slide 4, you show some strong commercial growth, from my point of view. You're also talking about
pipeline slowing a little bit, but it looks pretty good to me. I guess – I don't know if it's for you or Pat but what's
going on with your core commercial clients and what's driving that general commercial growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Do you want to take that, Pat?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I think it's largely what Andy's focused on. We spent last year beefing up, adding RMs, and helping to really
focus on where we're going to – what our key relationships are and our core client profile is.
To an earlier point, we're not out chasing business in stretching. We haven't changed our credit box. So it's just a
matter of getting more people on the street, talking to the clients we want to bank and it's really kind of helped to
generate. And while the pipeline is down, it's still pretty solid opportunities that we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, just to expand on that as well, this is Andy. We've spoken to the quality of the RM and the fact that we'd
gotten them from almost every major competitor in the footprint. But the proof's in the pudding and so now when
you see treasury management sales up and you see pipelines continuing to grow the business, then when you
see your commercial deposits going up, we believe we've hired some really talented RMs. And frankly, we had
some talented RMs in-house as well and so we've married those two and it's put us on a pretty good path.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then last one for you, Pat, slide 15 on credit. I agree. The numbers look very tame, but more
curious what you're seeing in consumer credit and any themes and anything you're watching in consumer. It's a
little tick up in non-accrual, but de minimis. But what are you seeing and what are you watching?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
We continue to watch delinquencies. We continue to watch payment trends and to be honest, we've seen
everything really remain flat and improve in some spots. Our residential arm portfolio continues to improve from a
delinquency standpoint. As Andy mentioned, the indirect auto has done great. Credit card book really we're still
trending positive there relative to pre-pandemic. So from a consumer standpoint, we've been really happy with the
production there. But I think it's a reflection of that prime and super prime focus.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Just a quick piggyback on that, I mean, just the unemployment rate in the state of Wisconsin is 2.4%. People are
working and when they work, they typically pay, especially if they're prime and super prime customers.
So we watched closely the unemployment figures and delinquencies. And the delinquency on page 15 actually
shows a little bump up but what it doesn't speak to is that we had on a syndicated credit on the upstream, there
was an administrative mix up or slip or slowdown that stopped payment from coming to us. That accounted for
about 3 basis points and so that's already been rectified in July. So essentially, our delinquencies are flat.

Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Not that one particular situation. The situation Andy just talked about was just tied to the delinquency. The non-
accrual, that was actually one other deal. It's a one-off transaction that we recognized in the quarter. We're not
seeing anything from a trend standpoint in the commercial book that would lead us to any other concerns going
into Q3.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I did want to follow up on the $300 million of mass affluent deposit growth. I just wanted to ask
you if you had a sense for kind of what deposit categories that growth went into. You had good customer CD
growth so I just want to know if it was kind of like leading with CDs or anything – any detail you can give us there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I don't have the immediate break out, but since a lot of it came from existing customers that had checking
accounts, it's going to be an interest-bearing deposit accounts and the money that came in. So whether that is
money market savings or CD, it would be largely in those categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I did want to follow-up and maybe just ask again on Scott's question from earlier on the NII
guidance. I mean, just the math would dictate that if I take the low end of your NII guide, it implies that you'd need
to earn $521 million in NII in the back half of the year, which is about $260 million to $261 million per quarter, just
doing the simple math.
And so it implies a step-up, but the margin, it doesn't sound like we're going to call a bottom. The NIBs were not
willing to say that they won't go down anymore. I guess I'm struggling with the NII guidance just a little bit in light
of those two issues. So any additional color you could provide around maybe the average earning asset base
that's in your assumption or what could actually cause the back half of the year to exhibit the growth you need to
hit the low end of the guidance would really be appreciated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. Looking at the – it's the 6% to 8% earning asset growth that we talked about. And then margins similar to
what we've been looking at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And maybe could I just ask on the auto and maybe the indirect CRE? Maybe talk to me a little bit about like
the – funding that loan growth and like what the incremental spread looks like. It sounds like you're getting pretty
good loan yields on the auto. But just given that they don't come with those two categories historically, haven't
really come with much in the way of deposits. Just wanted to kind of get a sense for how you're funding that and
what the incremental spread looks like when you do fund that loan.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, yeah, I can speak to that. Generally speaking, our incremental rate, we don't fund one loan at a time and
one deposit at a time. So our marginal deposit growth rates have been between 4% and 5%. And the auto book
that we're talking about is generally getting 2% spreads and then you're getting 1.5% to 2% on your variable rate
C&I loans. And so that's what our outlook is based on.
And then the performance of the back book and the pay down on fixed rate securities and auto loans a couple
years ago was much lower rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'm not sure how to speak to this because new originated CRE is not a huge number right now. But what I would
say is we're getting a very good margin on the deals that we're doing on CRE.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And then there's the last one on capital. The credit metrics are totally benign here and I understand that. I just
wanted to ask like when you do comp yourself against your peer group, the CET1 is lower than I think where the
peer group is. It's probably justifiable based on the credit outlook, on your credit metrics. But is there any thought
given to maybe being closer to the middle of the pack and having a 10-plus percent CET1 range moving forward
just to maybe give investors or whoever more comfort around capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. What we've got in there now is the same range we had beginning of the year. It doesn't prohibit us from
being higher than that but if loan growth is at the higher end of what we've expected to, then that's where we
could come in. If a loan growth is less than that, we would accrue above that CET1 range that we've got outlined
in there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Said another way, we have 6% loan growth. We would expect to be higher than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions, everyone. I appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Maybe asking the prior question a little bit different. You talked about growing the company and
obviously that's the right strategy over time. With your stock at tangible book, is there a scenario where you would
consider shrinking additional non-core assets and buying back your stocks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
That won't be my priority in the immediate future, Chris. We have opportunity. When you have low-yielding assets
on the books and you have initiatives that are working that produce higher yielding assets, that's the number one
way over time to return to the shareholder.
And so that will be the plan. If we see that that growth is not there and we have opportunity to use our capital in a
different way, we do have dollars set aside for stock repurchase, but that would not be my intent for the rest of
2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then, Derek, I think you said it's 52% that was a cycle-to-date beta. I want to make sure I
heard that right and also what the updated thoughts there for full cycle. I may have missed it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. You did hear that right and we'd expect to be in the high 50s for the full cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks.
