Thank you, Sylvia, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first (sic) third (00:43) quarter earnings
call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial
Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions. Turning to our earnings presentation
materials that are available on our website, on slide 2 you will see discussion of forward-looking statements.
Specifically, during the call you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe
provide insight into the company operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP
numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause

actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2021
earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders, and our 2020 10-K report. We make no obligation to
publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that you'll see our
adjusted operating results followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes
enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of core operations and
facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, and thanks for joining us. As you saw, Ameriprise delivered another excellent quarter building on a
strong year. We continue to perform extremely well. The environment in the US is largely positive as the economy
continues to show solid growth. Equity markets remained strong and have recovered from a weaker September.
Inflation has picked up given demand, and there remains some headwinds due to pandemic. In Europe conditions
continued to improve. As you consider this backdrop, we're executing well and consistently generating important
organic growth and shareholder value. Our differentiated results reflect the strategic investments we've made in
the business and a culture built on performance and a high level of care for our clients and team.
Our growth businesses are delivering strong client flows, and nearly $14 billion of inflows in the Wealth
Management and Asset Management businesses in the quarter. So with these positive flows and markets, assets
under management and administration are up 21% to $1.2 trillion. Turning to our financials, the excellent results
we delivered in the quarter reflect the high level of performance we've generated this year. Adjusted operating
results for the quarter excluding unlocking, revenues came in strongly at $3.5 billion, up 17% fueled by continued
organic growth and attractive markets. Earnings rose 32% with earnings per share up 38% reflecting strong
business growth in capital management, and ROE is exceptional at nearly 48% compared to 35.5% a year ago.
Let's move to Advice & Wealth Management where we continue to deliver meaningful and consistent growth. With
the strategic investments we've made over many years coupled with our expertise in planning, we're delivering a
differentiated and referable advice experience. Clients are actively engaged with us. They're turning to Ameriprise
and our advisors for comprehensive advice and solutions. And they're leveraging our extensive digital capabilities
to track and achieve their goals. Our client experience is sophisticated, personalized and supported by our
integrated digital technology and backed by our strong reputation. In fact, Investor's Business Daily recently
named Ameriprise the number one Most Trusted Wealth Manager.
We've earned this impressive credential based on how consumers rate Ameriprise for how we serve them, the
quality of our products and services, our commitment to ethical practices, fair prices and protecting personal data.
To being number one in trust is high praise and we're on it. This type of recognition and client satisfaction doesn't
happen without an industry leading advisor for us that's highly engaged. Our advisors are benefiting from our
training, coaching and suite of tools to build and deepen client relationships, track prospects and run and grow
their practices through our fully integrated platform. This positive momentum and engagement are leading to
robust client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Our results reflect the traction on organic growth that
we've consistently demonstrated.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Total client inflows were up 64% to $10 billion, continuing the positive trend we've seen over the past several
quarters. Wrap net inflows were excellent at $9.4 billion, up 65%. Transactional activity grew for another quarter
up nearly 16% over last year with good volume across a range of product solutions. Advisor productivity reached
another new high of 18% adjusted for interest rates to a record $766,000 per advisor. I'd highlight that our
advisors continue to be recognized across the industry, including in top national rankings from Barron's, Forbes
and Working Mother. We have long focused on driving productivity growth for advisors, and we're generating
some of the highest growth rates in the industry. At the same time, we complement this with targeted recruiting of
experienced productive advisors who are attracted to our brand and value proposition.
In the quarter, recruiting picked up nicely and another 104 experienced advisors joined us. We're getting a great
response from our in-person events and virtual recruiting activities. And importantly, the quality of our recruits is
very good. Let's turn to the bank where total assets grew to nearly $11 billion in the quarter. The trends we've
been discussing with you remain consistent. We continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we're
seeing a growing demand for our recently introduced lending solutions, especially our pledge loan product that is
getting good initial traction. To wrap up Advice & Wealth Management, our metrics and financials are very strong.
Pre-tax income was $459 million, up 43%, and margin was strong at 22.4%, up 320 basis points, which compares
very well in the industry.
Now, I'll turn to Asset Management, where we continue to build on our momentum and results. Assets under
management increased 17% to $583 billion. Our outstanding research is core to our business and our ability
consistently generate excellent investment performance for clients. That's across equity, fixed income and asset
allocation strategies with more than 85% of our funds above the medium on asset-weighted basis on a three, five
and 10-year basis. In fact, compared to the broad group of US peers we tracked, we performed at or near the top
of the Lipper rankings for multiple time periods. Flows remained strong given our excellent investment
performance, client experience and continued support we provide advisors and our partner firms.
We had net inflows of $3.9 billion in the quarter. This is an improvement of nearly $5.5 billion from a year ago.
Global retail net inflows were $1.8 billion, driven by North America. While overall industry sales were a bit weaker
in the quarter given the summer months, overall, our flow traction is good. We continue to have good sales and
equity strategies. And consistent with our plans, we're gaining traction within fixed income, and that's across
multiple channels and structures. I'd note that we expanded our successful suite of strategic beta fixed income
ETFs in the quarter with the launch of the Columbia Short Duration Bond ETF.
In EMEA retail, market conditions remain challenging and while we experienced some net outflows, flows have
improved from the second quarter. In terms of Global Institutional, excluding legacy insurance partners, net
inflows were $3.5 billion. The team is working hard to generate wins across equity and fixed income strategies in
each of our three regions. In fact, we're seeing a number of current clients adding to their positions. Of course, we
recognize there will be shifts and flows quarter-to-quarter given the size of certain institutional mandates. Our
client service and consultant relation teams have good traction, and we're making considerable progress
expanding our consultant ratings, which position us well for growth.
As I look at the year thus far for institutional, we're making good progress. That includes expanding our presence
in APAC where we announced the opening of our new Japan office that complements our other locations in the
region. Turning to BMO EMEA acquisition, we look forward to closing the transaction shortly pending final
regulatory approval. I feel good about how we're tracking. We'll be able to provide more details after we close and
when we release fourth quarter results in January. To wrap-up Asset Management, we're serving clients well
while maintaining our attractive organic growth and profitability.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions, our results continue to be strong. These are high quality businesses
that generate solid earnings and excellent free cash flow. We continue to focus on non-guaranteed retirement and
asset accumulation protection products that deliver benefits to clients and our shareholders. Consistent with this
strategy, the majority of our annuity sales in the quarter did not include living benefit guarantees. Sales increased
28% and have shifted to both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living
benefits. On the insurance side, life and health insurance sales increased 77%, driven by our VUL product,
appropriate given the current low rates. We've also seen good response to our DI products reflecting our financial
planning approach.
To summarize, Ameriprise has built a differentiated book of business over many years that deliver superior
financial results that are sustainable. It starts with providing clients with solutions that meet their long-term
retirement needs, have appropriate benefits and generate good risk-adjusted returns for the company. Now let me
highlight why Ameriprise is clearly differentiated in financial services. In terms of our balance sheet, our capital
management remains a real strength. Our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses are
performing very well and generating excellent growth, margins and returns. We compare quite favorably across
the industry. And our Retirement & Protection business is valuable and high quality, generating good free cash
flow and returns. It's entirely focused on our channel and differentiated from anything else out there.
Listen, we're generating some of the strongest returns in the industry and have been for quite some time, and
we're able to do it with lower volatility. Importantly, we've returned capital to shareholders at very attractive levels.
In fact, we consistently return nearly all of our operating earnings to shareholders annually. And if you look at that
over the last five years, we reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 28%. This is all while we're
consistently investing in the business and maintaining a sizable excess capital position that gives us flexibility. In
closing, Ameriprise is positioned well. Our team is focused on key priorities to drive organic growth and we're
delivering for our clients. In fact, I was just with our top advisors last week to recognize their achievements and
discuss our growth priorities. It was terrific being together. As I think about all of Ameriprise, it's great to have
people back in the office more in person again as we focus on finishing the year strong.
Now, Walter will review the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS of
38% to $5.91, excluding unlocking. In fact, we reached new record levels for revenue, pre-tax adjusted operating
earnings and return on equity in the quarter. We delivered strong flows, earnings growth and margin expansion in
our core Wealth and Asset Management businesses. Results in the quarter are a continuation of the excellent
trends we have been seeing this year as we successfully execute our growth strategies.
This is driving our business mix shift, both Wealth and Asset Management representing about 80% of earnings.
Retirement & Protection performed well, and we remain focused on optimizing our risk return trade-offs in this
environment. We generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses. Our balance sheet fundamentals are
excellent with significant excess capital. Combined, this allows Ameriprise to consistently return substantial capital
to shareholders with 95% of adjusted operating earnings returned in the quarter, putting us on track to achieve
our 90% target for the full year.
Let's turn to slide six. We are focused on growth in our core Wealth and Asset Management businesses, and we
hit some important milestones this quarter. We are seeing excellent AUM growth of 21% to $1.2 trillion on flows
and markets. Flows in these businesses have improved substantially, up over 200% from a year ago, and up
5

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
nearly 140% on a year-to-date basis, representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of
these businesses.
Let's turn to slide seven, where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth. Revenues in Wealth
and Asset Management grew 23% to nearly $3 billion with pre-tax operating earnings of $744 million, up 44%.
Importantly, earnings growth from Wealth and Asset Management outpaced revenue growth demonstrating the
operating leverage of the business. And the blended margin for these two businesses expanded 370 basis points
from last year, with Wealth Management up 320 basis points and Asset Management up 500 basis points, further
illustrating our ability to deliver profitable growth.
Turning to slide 8, this chart clearly illustrates our success executing our growth and business mix shift strategy.
Specifically, the Wealth and Asset Management businesses are driving about 80% of the earnings over the past
12 months. This is coupled with a stable $700 million contribution from Retirement & Protection Solutions. With
that as an overview, let's review the individual segment performance beginning with Wealth Management on slide
9. The strategies we have in place to support advisors and improve their productivity using integrated industry-
leading tools, technology and training has resulted in increased flows and transactional activity.
Total client assets were up over 25% to $811 billion over the past two years. Our advisor force continued to
deliver exceptional productivity growth across market cycles. Revenue per advisor reached a new high of
$766,000 in the quarter, up 24% over the past two years. Importantly, over the past two years, the annualized
organic growth rate for Wealth Management flows improved to 6% compared to 4% in 2019. This is coming from
advisors penetrating their existing client base and adding new clients, complemented by recruiting experienced
advisors. And we are pleased that our strategies are translating to this level of organic growth.
On page 10 you can see that we are delivering growth as well as excellent financial results in Wealth
Management. In fact, revenue and earnings for Wealth Management also reached record levels this quarter.
Adjusted operating net revenues grew 23% to over $2 billion fueled by robust client flows, a 16% increase in
transactional activities and market appreciation. Wealth Management pre-tax adjusted operating earnings
increased 43% to $459 million. Ameriprise Bank is adding to the growth from Wealth Management primarily by
allowing us to pick up incremental spread and cash sweep deposits. In total, the bank has nearly $11 billion of
assets after moving an additional $1.1 billion of sweep cash on to our balance sheet in the quarter.
In the quarter, the average spread on the bank assets was 144 basis points compared to off-balance sheet cash
earnings of 28 basis points. In addition, we are seeing good growth in banking products, including pledge lending
that has gained substantial traction with our advisor base since the product was launched in the fourth quarter of
2020. Expenses remain well managed. G&A expense increased 1% as higher activity based expenses and
performance based compensation were largely offset by expense discipline. In the quarter, our pre-tax adjusted
operating margin was 22.4%, an increase of 320 basis points from the prior year and 100 basis points
sequentially.
Let's turn to Asset Management on slide 11, where significant success is also being realized. Over the past two
years, asset under management increased 18%. We also saw a net flow shift from outflows in 2019 to a 5%
growth rate this year. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing positive flows across both retail and institutional
distribution channels, supported by excellent investment performance. And like the industry, we saw a bit of a
slowdown during the summer months, though our relative position among our peers remain strong. The operating
leverage in Asset Management is significant with margins for the trailing 12 months up 44.6%, up 830 basis points
over the last two years.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Turning to page 12, you see these trends generated excellent financial performance in Asset Management.
Adjusted operating revenues increased 24% to $915 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows,
market depreciation and performance fees. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4%. Importantly, our fee rate
remained strong and stable at 53 basis points. Expenses remained well managed and in line with expectations
giving you revenue growth. G&A expenses were up 14%, primarily from compensation expense, and other
variable costs related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation. Pre-tax adjusted
operating earnings grew 44% to $285 million, and we delivered a 49% margin.
Moving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue, and anticipate that margins will remain in the
mid-40% range over the near term, driven by the continued flow momentum and equity markets at these levels.
As Jim mentioned, we are on track to close the BMO EMEA transaction in the fourth quarter. This acquisition will
add significant capabilities from a strategic perspective and drive improved business fundamentals going forward.
Let's turn to page 13. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to reflect excellent underlying business
performance, differentiated risk profile and a continued generation of substantial free cash flow. Pre-tax adjusted
operating earnings were $192 million, excluding unlocking, down from $206 million a year ago. Current year
results reflect lower profitability from increased sales levels whereas results in the prior year benefited from lower
sales as well as lower surrenders and withdrawals. In total, unlocking impacts in the quarter were immaterial
resulting from consistent client behavior and interest rates that were in line with prior year estimates.
We saw a strong pickup in sales of Retirement & Protection products in the quarter with a continued mix shift
towards non-guaranteed retirement products. During the quarter, the variable annuity sales increased 28% from
last year, with 72% of sales and products without living benefit guarantees. Account value with living benefits
represent only 62% of the overall book now, down another 200 basis points in the past year. We had similar
trends in protection with sales up 77% driven by higher margins VUL sales. This mix in sales and [indiscernible]
(22:59) for both Retirement & Protection products are expected to continue.
Additionally, in the appendix of this presentation, we have provided our annual update on long-term care
business. You will observe that the business continues to perform in line with expectations from a claims
perspective. The policy count continues to decline as the book ages, and we are garnering additional premium
rate increases. Now, approximately 90% of the book has extensive or substantial credible experience. And I will
note, that we did not incorporate recent improvements in mortality and morbidity related to COVID-19 into our
long-term assumptions. Overall, our actual performance continues to be in line with expectations.
Let's turn to slide 14. In the quarter, you have seen transactions announced in insurance and annuity space. In
light of these announcements, I felt it will be helpful to provide additional context as it relates to how we view our
business. As Jim has indicated, we believe our I&A business is a highly valuable asset with a client solution-
driven capability that has generated sustainable and predictable financial results, and free cash flow generation,
coupled with a low risk profile. The driver of this is our prudent approach in building all aspects of this business,
resulting in a proven track record of superior value creation. The behavior of our clients has been consistent,
reflecting the nature of the product sale as part of the financial plan. We have taken a conservative approach to
product features, including guarantees and credit rates as well as requiring asset allocation for living benefits.
We have maintained consistent sales level and industry market share over the last decade, avoiding the arms
race seen from time to time in the industry. And our economic hedging program has performed well across market
cycles with 97% effectiveness over the past five years. Finally, we have taken prudent and appropriate actions to
manage the risk profile of the business. For example, we stopped sales of LTC in 2002 and have successfully
implemented premium rate actions and increased protection with our LTC reinsurance partner. We also sold our
7

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Auto & Home business, reinsured our fixed annuity businesses and have reduced living benefit sales. This
consistent and prudent approach has resulted in a stable earnings with 24% margins and a pre-tax return on
capital exceeding 50% with consistent free cash flow generation.
Our balance sheet fundamentals are strong with a high-quality investment portfolio and strong risk-based capital
ratio. This performance is best-in-class in the industry over many years. We have demonstrated superior return
on capital, dividends paid and capital ratios. And our net amount at risk is substantially lower than peers. In
summary, this is a very valuable business and we are well-positioned. It is now only 20% of our earnings. We
have demonstrated that the exposure profile is well managed, and we completed our annual unlocking with very
minor updates. With that being said, we will continue to evaluate options from a position of strength to make the
best decisions to drive all aspects of shareholder value creation.
Now, let's move to the balance sheet. Another area we have delivered strong results. Our balance sheet
fundamentals and risk management capability are cornerstones of what we do. It starts with how we manage the
business to generate substantial free cash flow in each of our segments. We had holding company available
liquidity of $3.7 billion and excess capital of $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We prudently manage credit risk
where we maintain an overall AA minus credit quality in our investment portfolio and have a highly effective hedge
strategy. These strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to
shareholders.
As I mentioned, we returned 95% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter, and we are on track to hit our 90%
target for the full year. We have executed our capital return consistently over the years. Our share count declined
28% over the past five years, even with issuing shares to fund share-based compensation programs. Over the
past year alone, the share count declined 5%. In summary, strong fundamentals across our businesses deliver
substantial free cash flow. We manage the balance sheet conservatively, and we have substantial liquidity and
capital flexibility. Combined, these attributes position us to continue delivering a differentiated level of capital
return to shareholders going forward.
With that, we will take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe
Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning, Jim, Walter. Hope you are both doing well. I wanted to start off with a question, and maybe a
multipart question just on the bank growth strategy. Given continued strong growth at the bank, up roughly 70%
year-on-year, as we look out over the next three to five years, what pace of growth should we be underwriting?
Where do you see the bank levels getting to on a more steady-state basis? And just given the meaningful gap
between you and peers in terms of loan penetration, and the strong demand for a pledge loan product that you
mentioned, what do you see as an achievable loan penetration rate or target over the long-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So with the bank, as you noticed, and we have certainly grown the underlying assets in the bank, we will
continue to do that. We have the capability for our overall cash strategy to switch from off balance sheet to on
balance sheet, and certainly manage our effective yield on that basis and give us alternatives. So we do see we
have a substantial room to grow. As we take deposits right now, they are in the $11 billion range, to be increasing
that by at least $2 billion to $3 billion as we move forward into the years and evaluate the situation.
It gives us certainly a yield pickup from that standpoint and gives diversity. As it relates to the underlying assets,
we are seeing tremendous success as we look at our pledge loan activity and margin loan activity, which, of
course, is in the broker dealer, and the [ph] over actives (30:05) we are investing to build that. And we will see a
significant penetration capability with that as the uplift has taken place since December when we launched the
pledge loans, it has been very good, and certainly the other products that Joe and his team are working on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. I'm recognizing it's a multiyear endeavor. Just curious, given some of your peers have loan
penetration rates around 1% to 1.5% of AUM, do you view that as a credible long-term target for Ameriprise as
well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, we do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Great. And just for my follow-up on organic growth sustainability, certainly encouraging to see you maintain
that 5% annualized organic growth rate. Also saw some improving trends in the employee channel as well as
better momentum in AFIG. I was hoping you could speak to what's driving that improved advisor adds both in the
employee channel as well as the financial institution channel. And just given those improving trends how that
informs your confidence level on the sustainability of that mid single-digit organic growth rate.

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So this is Jim. So first and foremost, the organic growth rate that we've been getting we feel very good about
based on how we're penetrating our own client base today, how we're enhancing and deepening the relationships
through our advice modules, and the support that we're giving the advisors with our tools and capabilities, that
really helped arm them engage the clients more fully. So we feel like, what we've made as good investments
there, training and development is really starting to show its fruits. In regard to the external recruitment, that has
picked up again, which we did as we moved from the virtual back to in-person.
We're seeing good advisors join us, good quality books. And we feel like we have a good opportunity as people
better understand the type of capabilities that we offer, the brand support that we provide, as well as the
recognition that we're getting there from a client perspective for trust in regard to our brand. And that's very
important. We see that both in the advisor employee channel, the franchisee, but as well in the AFIG channel. As
you know, it took us a little while to integrate that into our platforms and capabilities, and now we are actually
adding new bank partners and adding advisors to those partners. And so that's actually taking shape kind of
nicely for us, and we think there's a good growth path left forward on that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on the G&A expenses in AWM and
Asset Management. The overall expenses continue to surprise on the lower side, especially for AWM. The growth
was less than 1% year-over-year and actually down quarter-over-quarter. I understand that the lack of travel and
the delay in returning to the office was a factor, but organic growth activities were very strong. So it seems like the
expense management continue to yield very good benefits. Just how should we think about the G&A expenses
will trend going forward? I think in the past you talked about 3% to 4% growth rates. But why isn't that too
conservative?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The 3% to 4% is a good number from our standpoint. Certainly, we do believe that we are managing expenses
well and certainly making investments. But as you indicated, certainly, T&E expenses and other things have not
exactly returned, but we do see that certainly coming back into more steady state. But the 3% and 4% would be a
good number in my mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Got it. And then in terms of Asset Management, so retail flows were very good in the US, but the EMEA flows
continue to be a little bit weak. You talked about seeing some improvement since the second quarter. Can you
just talk about what you're seeing in that market, and what can you do to drive that forward? And then what do
you expect when the flows in EMEA will look like once the BMO acquisition is closed?

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So this is Jim. If we look at the wholesale flows in EMEA, they've actually were positive and been maintaining a bit
more positive over the course of the year. The UK was the area that even though it has improved, so it was still in
a bit of an outflow, it did improve over the last two quarters. And as you would imagine, the UK went through a bit
more of a lockdown in the summer months, they're still working through some of their issues regarding Brexit, et
cetera, just completing how that looks and how people should think about investing. But we actually see that with
the economy starting to bounce back, the pandemic starting to get a bit less impactful, that we should start to see
a bit more pick up there, but that was the weak spot in EMEA. But overall, it did improve over the course of the
year. Now on the institutional side, we've seen good inflows in EMEA, and in certain of the mandates as well as in
the UK we've gotten a big mandate there as well. So we see the institutional being a little firmer in that regard
versus the wholesaler intermediate at this point.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I want to go back to the discussion around the retirement
business. Obviously, you guys kind of provided more details and tried to kind of showcase the quality of the
business. Should we read that as sort of reaffirmation of your commitment to the business, or the fact that, look,
it's actually a great business [indiscernible] (36:15) with somebody else? And as a threshold, for us to think about
you highlight plus 30% ROE over three years in that business, how should we, I guess, think of that as a sort of a
metric for us to think about like, would you need to see to part with that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So Alex, it's an excellent question. And we figured that by giving you more information, someone would read
something into it different than someone else. So let me try to clarify that and what we try to do there. We've seen
the transactions, as Walter said, come out to market and people starting to realize that our book is a bit better
than what they've seen out there. And very clearly, we think it is significantly better. In that regard, the business is
less than 20% of our total today. It is very well managed. It generates very strong returns and cash flows. And so
the first thing I would convey to you as an investor and as an analyst is that it does not detract from our business.
It provides the level of diversity, it actually gives us strong cash flows that we use for buyback as a complement to
free cash flows we generate in the other businesses. So it doesn't, in any way, have a draw on capital. And that
it's been very steady and consistent with excellent returns on the overall capital that's deployed there. So one
thing we would bring to highlight is, as we hold the business, it should not be a discount or an overhang on us, is
the first thing. The second thing we would clearly say, just like we've sold the Auto & Home, we reinsured part of
the book, we've diverted our sales from activities that don't give us really good strong returns. We're very open to
continue to explore strategic opportunities with the book, either reinsurance of aspects or even the sale of certain
of the businesses or total.

But as long as it makes sense from a strategic perspective, supports our clients, and we can generate reasonable
value for that, we think it's a good operating business, it's really a great client-oriented business. It really has great
distribution capabilities as part of our solution set. So it might be a great opportunity strategically for us to
evaluate, but we wanted to be clear that this is not a discounted book that we must get rid of for whatever reason,
because it doesn't detract from us. And in fact, it shouldn't be a discount to the business today as we hold it. But if
someone was or we evaluated strategically, it made sense, I would tell you it's a valued business that should be
of a valued price.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Loud and clear. Thanks for that. My follow-up is around the Asset Management business. We saw
that Columbia is dividend-complaint, I think had a soft close in the third quarter. This has been a really big
contributor to the overall organic growth within Asset Management. Can you just spend maybe a minute on what
the soft close really means in this context, sort of, if you were to go back over the last 12 months, and say, hey, if
the product was soft closed back then, any kind of way to frame how much of a flow headwind this could create?
But also in the same context, maybe spend a minute on how the business may have been diversified a little bit
more. So to what extent should we really worry about this product soft closing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would not worry about it. We've been in sort of a soft close over the course of the year. What that really
means is, we still take additions to accounts that are already there, retail and institutional, which is still a good
flow. It's just that we don't go out and sell to new clients to add new mandates to it. And since we have a really
good book with the amount of incremental flows that come in from that book anyway, it still continues to be nice
accretive. On the other side, to the point that you raised, we have been able to really diversify our mix.
And so over the course of the year again, we have more than 10 different disciplines that are adding over $1
billion of flows too. So we feel really good about the diversification and what may still be in income products, if
that's where people are interested versus as well our fixed income businesses growing nicely with different types
of investments there, as well as some of the other equity products have also been gaining traction. So we feel like
our lineup is pretty diversified now, and each of what we're selling actually has excellent performance.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Really encouraging and great to see the good fundamentals in
AWM and the tick up there in FA head count this year. I guess, it seemed like from your comments that you think
the growth is sustainable. So just would like to confirm that that's your view. But also, could you maybe give some
additional perspective on your approach to recruiting? Where do you think you might stand versus your primary
competitors in the marketplace as far as competitiveness of packages is concerned? And is there may be a
willingness to step up if you guys are conservative, maybe approach the market a bit more, so you could drive a
bit more of that head count growth? Thanks.

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we feel very good about the continuation, our ability to continue to get good flows in the business and
have good client activity and relationships both from a client as well as with the advisor uptake of our capabilities.
And the same thing with recruiting. I think we really do have a really strong value proposition to offer advisors.
The biggest thing that we try to do is educate advisors versus what people are selling out there of what we offer
more completely and comprehensively. And we think it is very differentiated. We think that it really helps an
advisor really improve their productivity and drive a really good, strong practice, and so that's really what we focus
on.
Now part of that is the package financial for someone to transition, et cetera. We think that we offer competitive
packages there. We don't get overly aggressive less some that will sort of buy the business per se. We look at the
economics of that. I want to make sure that it is reasonable and appropriate to cycle. But we feel that the offering
is competitive. And when you add that to the totality of what we provide and the support, we think it's excellent
value. So that's the way we look to compete in the marketplace, and we feel good about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Excellent. Thank you for that. And then following-up on some of Steven's questions around the growth in the
bank, curious, clearly the bank saw a nice uptick in yields here this quarter, and that's really probably before you
even saw some benefit from rates given how it happened late in the quarter. And so clearly an attractive
economic proposition. How do you think about the possibility to perhaps even accelerate the deposit growth in the
bank? And when we think about this ultimately as a strategic driver of better economics in AWM, how do you think
about where the bank would break down as far as proportion or mix of the deposits? I mean, I would think it
should be the majority. But how are you guys thinking about it over these next few years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So I would say we actually reentered the banking business because we felt consistent with what you said
that it was a good strategic opportunity for us to complement our business in the marketplace. Clearly, we have
some experience going back on that and we absolutely did the business nicely at that point in time. And as you
recollect, the bank is kind of new right now. So we're just sort of ramping up. We're putting the products to market,
et cetera. And we think that we have a good growth trajectory of moving more deposits over. We think that the
margins in that business could be really good.
I mean, it's been a compressed spread market right now that's starting to open up a bit as we get down the road,
which I think will be favorable for us to continue to do the shift. And we are launching more of the lending products
in the bank, and some more deposit gathering products in the bank as well for our retail clients. Now, with that, it
will continue to take time to develop those books, but we see a really good traction in the ones we've launched
already. We'll be bringing more lending activities back on balance sheet over time for mortgages and home
equities and other things like that. So we do have our plans going out, and I think it will be a great complement to
the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. But is there any idea or aspiration or indication around proportional size of the bank versus the other
options like that?

Walter Stanley Berman A

I think from a movement of off balance sheet to balance sheet, that will become the majority of where the deposits
go. So that's exactly to your point, yes. As far as the lending penetration, again, as we increase the number of
different products we put out there for what we're going to penetrate, that's what we're working on now. But we
feel like we can get some good penetration based on some of our past experience of what we worked with
partners on.

John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Can you talk maybe about some of the flow synergies for the BMO EMEA Asset Management transaction and the
backdrop of strong flows for Columbia's thread needle maybe the opportunity in the US that the transaction
provides?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So we'll hopefully be able to close this in short order over the next few weeks. We're just waiting for one
more regulatory approval. And once we have that on the books, we can start to give you more information on it.
As you would imagine, with privacy and other things in the European market, that's been one that we can't really
get into even though some of the [indiscernible] (47:21). But from the actual sales activity that they've been
garnering over the last number of quarters, even though this transaction was done, has been very positive and
favorable. So there have been nice inflows there.
And that bodes well for us to assume the business. And so we think that that can continue. We like a lot of their
capabilities that we're already thinking about how we would integrate that in and carry some of those capabilities,
not just across our European business, but actually into the US. And from a US perspective, we think that a
number of the US assets are going to transfer over to us. We've been working as a client-by-client approval and
activities. But that looks very favorable, and we'll be able to give you more information as we get closer to the end
of the year.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Hey. Good morning. Just staying on the BMO EMEA transaction, I think it's a $700 million plus layout of capital.
Do you have an appetite to do any more transactions and where might that be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So we actually want to focus right now in the international market of closing and integrating in the BMO
transaction. We have good plans to do that and leverage that capability working with the people there. We think
that they add good complementary investment processes and people and capabilities, and that's our first order of
business. Having said that, as we have said, we have flat capital flexibility, if something else comes along that
would be complementary that fits we would definitely look to explore it. Having said that, we're not out in search of
something to do right now, but you never know when opportunities may arise. But if we're looking at the European
part of that equation, we're really focused on that integration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
I see. And if something were to come your way, any particular areas of note that you would strongly consider?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, again, what we're continuing to do is look at what could be complementary in either distribution or product
capability, some of the maybe alternative space or solutions. But again, we feel like we got a pretty good makeup.
And what BMO actually provides is a complement to the areas that we wanted to further invest in. And so that's
why, again, it would have to be really opportunistic rather than that we're in the hunt for something that we need
right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And then just – and maybe I missed this in the EMEA conversations, and you talked about flows exceeding
your expectations, which is quite promising. But at some point, there would have to be some breakage. Could you
give us a sense of how much breakage we might expect over the next year or two in the BMO EMEA operations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, as you would imagine, any time we go into a transaction or deal not knowing, we always factor in a level of
breakage, et cetera, and still feel very good about the arrangement that we've made and adding it to our equation.
Having said that, we feel like from what we know today, that looks less negative and more positive than what we
always initially assumed. But again, it's early stages. But I think what's important is that this will be complementary
to us. We're not integrating and consolidating investment processes and people. We're adding them. We're
keeping everything in tow as it is to really support clients the way they've been supported, add those processes
and investment professionals through our capability. And we also feel like we can add some further support to
what they've done in EMEA to complement their business that would be very helpful for their clients. So we feel
very positive at this stage. As we get further into it, of course, we'll always give you that – provide you that color.

Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Given the 747% RBC ratio at RiverSource right now following the fixed annuity deal, do you
plan to take higher than normal dividends up to the holding company this year and work that back down to a more
typical level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. The short answer is yes. Obviously, with the transaction on the fixed annuities that created that situation, so
we will be adjusting that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. And then just one follow-up on RiverSource. I guess in recent quarters, you've talked about receiving
inbound interest in RiverSource from third parties. Can you just give a little bit of an update on that? And in
particular, I guess, are you receiving interest from strategic buyers or just financial buyers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
It's been the multiple of it, and they are continuing, certainly as it relates to, as you've seen the activity in the

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the Asset Management side. The operating
margins were very strong. Just wondering, was it simply case of operating leverage or were there any other
particular drivers that you'd call out? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A

No. The operating leverage in the margins have been quite strong. And that certainly, again, we've targeted 35%
to 39%. It's been running in the mid-40%s, that is certainly a factor of market situations, which we expect will
continue if the markets [indiscernible] (54:05).

Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And just one follow-up, if I may. Wondering if we could just delve a little bit more into the organic growth
improvements you're seeing within the Advice & Wealth Management side. Wonder if you could just outline what
you think were the main contributors in that increase in growth rate over the past two years, and do you think that
we could still see similar rates improvement going forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. I think we feel very good about the growth rates and the continuation. And we feel a lot – don't get me wrong,
the markets are good, but we feel a lot has to do because you've seen a nice uplift from where we were based
upon the integrated technology and the solution and the advice modules we've been put into market that really
help the advisors engage a larger part of their client base, and deepen appropriately. We also have added a lot of
capabilities for them in our CRM systems, et cetera, to reach out to even more prospects and move up market
more. And so we're seeing a combination of things that are adding to that total flow picture. But what's really
important is the level of client and advisor engagement on things. And so we think that, that has given us that
level of uplift.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just a follow-up on potential risk transfer. So from what we're seeing and hearing, it looks like
pretty attractive pricing on what's the majority of your business, which would be variable annuities and life
insurance. But less so, we hear the market for long-term care transactions is pretty challenged. And obviously,
you haven't had a deal on that market for quite some time. Is one option for you retaining long-term care and
selling the rest of your business, and if so, would that be a tough deal to structure, or is that doable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, listen, there's a lot of options coming in. As we talk about it is, you're correct, the LTC is certainly evolving at
a slow pace than the others. But the good thing about it is the strength of what we believe is our position with that
business. So yes, we could structure something of that nature. But right now, I don't want to get into speculation
of it. But the good thing about it is it's performing the way we thought it would, and we feel comfortable with it.

Thanks for that Walter. And then just a follow-up. The one – I kind of agree with everything you have on your slide
in terms of the, we'll say, the positive attributes of your business relative to some of the other businesses that
have been sold. Probably the most unique aspect is your distribution and I think the generally better margins and
lower risk. Do you think if something does evolve here that you would get paid something in addition for that
distribution, and if so, is there any way to think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Tom, again, you're right on point. I mean, we actually have one of the best channels if you want to sell a longer-
term solution. And the capability there is there for someone that really wants to continue to be in the business in a
good way. And based on the type of offering, our clients look for reasonable appropriate benefits, reasonable
appropriate pricing and consistency of delivery. So yes, it would be probably if someone's in this business, it's
probably one of the best channels for them to access.

Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Thank you. Just one more follow-up on the RPS, I think in the slide, you highlight the very strong cash flow
from this block, which has been over 100% of GAAP earnings and it's a lot higher than peers. So just wondering,
what's allowing you to generate this level of cash flow? And is this a sustainable level moving forward if you hold
sales and flows roughly stable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, it is. And certainly, we feel, as you look at – we've been maintaining our RBC ratio, it is certainly the quality
of the book and the cash flows within them. So we feel very confident with the capital requirements, looking at it
from a [ph] stat (59:00) standpoint that this is a sustainable proposition. Obviously, there's been ins and outs
related to other aspects such as Auto & Home and other things of that nature. But on a regular steady-state basis,
yes, it's in the range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
