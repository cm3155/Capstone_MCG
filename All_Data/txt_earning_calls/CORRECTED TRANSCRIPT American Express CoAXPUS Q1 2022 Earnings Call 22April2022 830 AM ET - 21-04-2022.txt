Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day last
month, we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our
businesses and explained why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for 2024 and beyond.
As we said then, our confidence is based on three inter-related factors: The success of the strategy we've been
pursuing over the past several years which focuses on investing in our brand, customers, value propositions,
coverage, technology and talent to build share, scale and relevance; the momentum we've been generating
through the effective execution of that strategy; and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are
contributing to our momentum.
The strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the full-year
despite the uncertain macro environment. And they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-
term aspirations.
For the quarter, revenues were $11.7 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and earnings were – earnings per share
were $2.73. These results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to
sustainable long-term growth, including customer acquisitions, engagement and retention, as well as outstanding
credit performance. New proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace, reaching 3 million this quarter,
which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, particularly among millennial

and Gen-Z consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses in the US. We had an all-time high in
acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Cards as well as U.S. Business Platinum Cards this is quarter.
Delta Cards acquisitions reached an all-time monthly high in March, an indication of the growing demand for
travel-related products and services. Regarding customer engagement, we look at a variety of indicators to
measure progress. For example, card member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow, with
daily active users across the web and mobile up double digits over the last year. We're also seeing strong
engagement with the new benefits we added to our recently refreshed consumer Platinum Card particularly
among millennial and Gen-Z card members. Nearly half of them have used at least one of the new travel and
lifestyle benefits to-date. And we continue to see an acceleration in customer engagement with our Resy dining
platform including strong double-digit growth over the last quarter in a number of Amex cards on file and a
number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program.
March was one of Resy's best months on record for reservations, up nearly 16% over February. Ultimately, the
key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth. Overall billed business grew 35% in Q1 globally
year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis and we saw our highest volumes ever in March, surpassing our previous
highest of December of 2021. Spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and Gen-Z
consumers up 56% and SMEs up 30% on an FX-adjusted basis over last year. Goods and services spending
continued to accelerate in the quarter, growing 21% on an FX-adjusted basis over last year. Travel and
entertainment spending was up 121% globally on an FX-adjusted basis year-over-year, driven by strong growth in
consumer travel spending. Customer retention remains at the very high levels I mentioned at Investor Day, an
indication of the value our customers continue to place on Amex membership.
A major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships which
go well beyond our long strategic partners like Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We continue to expand relationships
with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model. For example, last week
we announced a new financial advice service with vanguard exclusive for our U.S. Consumer Card Members
which brings together vanguard's digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our
industry-leading Membership Rewards. This is just the latest example of how we're expanding our value
propositions beyond our traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers' financial and lifestyle needs.
In addition, we're accelerating our focus on FinTechs to drive more innovation, including our new partnership with
i2c which will enable FinTechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the American Express
network. We also continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives which are important components of our
overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers, communities and colleagues thrive, so
does our company.
On a diversity, equity and inclusion front, we are more than three quarters away towards our goal of investing $1
billion in a wide range of actions by 2024, including increasing spend with diverse suppliers, providing resources
and financial assistance to minority owned SMEs in the US and maintaining pay equity across genders globally
and domestics in the US, among other efforts.
Our DEI progress was cited as one of the key reasons along with our flexible work policies for our Number 8
ranking on Fortune's 2022 list of the Best US Companies to Work For, which was announced last week. This is
the third consecutive year we've been in the top ten which helps us attract and retain talent. And we recently
announced a series of initiatives coinciding with Earth Month that are designed to engage our customers,
community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including a goal of significantly expanding the use of

recycled plastics in our card products. These initiatives build on the work we've already done and continue our
efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint, including our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2035.
In summary, with this solid start to the year and the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from
the pandemic, we're reaffirming our full-year guidance of delivering revenue growth in a range of 18% to 20%, and
earnings per share of between $9.25 and $9.65. Furthermore, we remain confident that successful execution of
our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in
excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to Jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter. Thank you.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our first quarter results which
reflect a solid start to 2022 and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full-year and with our
aspiration to build growth momentum beyond 2022.
Starting with our summary financials on slide 2, most importantly, our first quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, up
31% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the momentum we have built and our longer-term growth
aspirations. Our reported first quarter net income was $2.1 billion, with earnings per share of $2.73.
As you know, year-over-year comparisons to net income have been challenging for the industry over the past two
years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments. For that reason, we
thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pre-tax pre-provision income.
That number was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 16% versus the comparable number in 2021, reflecting growth
in our core earnings.
So now, let's get into a little more detailed look at our results starting with volumes. As you can see in our slides,
we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a year-over-year basis, moving away from the
comparisons to 2019 that we have done in recent quarters. We think that returning to a focus on year-over-year
comparisons gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to
maintain as we look towards our longer-term growth objectives.
Starting on slide 3, total network volumes and billed business were both up over 30% year-over-year in the first
quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters.
And as Steve highlighted, intra-quarter, while Omicron's slow growth in January and early February, we then saw
a strong acceleration into March with that month achieving our highest-ever level of monthly billed business. And I
would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the
number of transactions flowing through our network, with only a modest impact from inflation.
Now, as I talked about at our Investor Day last month and as slide 4 reiterates, the majority of our billed business
is spending on goods and services from our consumer, and small- and medium-sized enterprise customers. And
as you can see on slide 5, goods and services spending remained robust in the first quarter with year-over-year
growth reaching 21%, slightly above the 2021 exit rate. This momentum is from strong growth in Online and Card
Not Present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened,
demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that we've seen accelerated by the pandemic.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
And while T&E spending is a smaller portion of our total billings, you see on slide 6 that it is now strongly
supporting our growth momentum, with overall T&E spending growing 121% year-over-year. T&E spending did
show a dip in January and early February due to the Omicron variant but spending then rebounded tremendously,
reflecting pent-up travel demand and essentially reached 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the
pandemic in the month of March. And this kind of T&E spending growth has continued right into early April.
When you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we
begin to do on slide 7, there are a few other key points I suggest you take away. First, our millennial and Gen-Z
customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up 56% year-over-year and
spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter. Also, of note, Global Consumer T&E
volumes overall were back above 2019 levels as of the first quarter, led by the growth in the US.
Second, our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping SME clients run their businesses continues to
drive strong growth in overall SME spending, up 30% in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both
the US and international. While a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment, I would point out that our
large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery, especially in the latter
part of the quarter, with a year-over-year growth rate for the quarter of 42%. So overall, we are pleased with the
growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our
expectations for both the year and for our long-term expectations.
As you then move to receivable and loan balances on slide 9, you see that our growth momentum has brought
our ending loan balances roughly back to pre-pandemic levels in this quarter. As I said at Investor Day, the
interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter but is still below
2019 levels as pay-down rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base.
This liquidity and strength is also, of course, evident as you turn to credit and provision on slides 10 through 12.
As we continue to see extremely strong credit performance, Card Member loans and receivables, write-off and
delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and in line with our expectations, though they did tick up
a bit this quarter. As you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance, you will see that this quarter we
released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the
pandemic which lacked comparable precedent.
As we have seen, a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns, we have been able to
reduce pandemic-driven reserves. While there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current
geopolitical and inflationary environment, we believe that our CECL models are better able to capture our
expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required. Our
strong credit performance, combined with the adjustment to our reserves, drove a $33 million provision expense
benefit for the first quarter, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the net reserve release, as shown on slide 11.
As you see on slide 12, we ended the first quarter with $3.1 billion of reserves, representing 3.3% of our loan
balances and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels
we had pre-pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen. Going forward, as loan balances,
especially the interest-bearing portion of loan balances, build more meaningfully, we expect delinquency and loss
rates to continue to slowly move up over time but remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. We'd also expect
to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, although
there could be some quarterly volatility and reserve adjustments throughout the year.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
As we move to revenue, on slide 13, I do need to explain some changes we've made to our revenue reporting
before moving on on to results. As a reminder, we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last
year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those where we play more of a network
role. For added transparency, we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of
discount revenue, other fees and commissions, and other revenue, and combined them into a newly created line
called processed revenue, which you can then match up against our processed volumes.
We have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one
line named service fees and other revenue, with the largest components of this line item being service fees
earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business and foreign currency-related
revenues such as FX conversion fees. This revenue line was up strongly 42% growth year-over-year in the first
quarter, as you will see on the next slide. This growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel-
related revenues; and as I said at Investor Day, we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this
year. You will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release. A
description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our Form 10-Q.
With these changes out of the way, let's move to our actual revenue performance beginning on slide 14. Total
revenues were up 29% year-over-year in the first quarter with broad-based revenue growth across all lines. Our
largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 38% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see
on slide 15. This growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued
recovery of T&E spending.
Net card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth
reaccelerating versus the 10% to 11% growth rates seen in 2021, as you can see on slide 16. As I said at Investor
Day, this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts on to our fee-paying products as a result of the
investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value
propositions to both prospects and existing customers.
This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer and U.S. Business Platinum
Card Members reaching record high, as Steve noted earlier, demonstrating great demand for our products
especially our premium fee-based products.
Moving on to net interest income on slide 17, you will see that it surpassed 2019 levels for the first time this
quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense in part due to our increased mix of deposits, which is generally
our lowest cost funding source particularly in today's rising rate environment. First quarter year-over-year net
interest income growth of 20%, while very strong, remained slower than the growth in our lending AR as revolving
loan balances continue to rebuild. And so, we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to
our revenue growth in 2022.
To sum up on revenues on slide 18, we're tracking well against our expectations and looking forward we still
expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% for the full-year of 2022. So, all of the revenue momentum we just
discussed was driven by the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, coverage,
technology and talent; and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 19. Starting with
variable customer engagement expenses, the strong spending growth in customer engagement, as Steve
discussed earlier, is driving the growth in these expense lines.
In total, these costs came in at 41% of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our
expectation for variable customer engagement costs to run at around 42% of total revenues for the full-year. On

the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the first quarter, on track with our expectation to spend around $5
billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions, as I talked about
earlier, and more importantly about the revenues from those acquisitions, which is trending significantly higher
than what we saw pre-pandemic. We continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of
attractive investment opportunities even beyond those we are currently funding.
Moving to the bottom of slide 19, operating expenses were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, tracking with our
expectation to spend a bit over $12 billion for the full-year. While OpEx was up 26% year-over-year this quarter, it
is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of $384 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex
Ventures strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year, including in the OpEx line. I would point
out that while I said earlier that inflation is having some modest positive impact on volumes, it is also putting some
pressure on our operating expenses, but we'll have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full-
year. In any event, I still expect to have far less growth in OpEx compared to revenues and see these costs as a
key source of leverage.
Turning next to capital on slide 20, we returned $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter,
including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and $394 million in common stock dividends on the back of
strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the first quarter within our target range of
10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our
balance sheet growth.
That brings me to our growth plan on slide 21, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. For the full-year
2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 18% to 20% in earnings per share of between
$9.25 and $9.65. We continue to expect the amount of our volumes, revenues and core earnings to sequentially
strengthen throughout the year, driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds. As I mentioned earlier, there's
clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment.
As we sit here today, despite that uncertainty, the combination of our investments, successful execution of our
strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and
build growth momentum. We remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the
company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens
EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go
ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, the T&E rebound is happening at a brisk pace despite some of these lingering
concerns on COVID cases, economic weakness. Jeff, you mentioned large corporate also recently saw strong
rebound recently. Could you talk about how much of the volume rebound is being driven by unit demand versus
sort of inflationary pressures? And how worried are you or your corporate clients about some of these issues like
supply chain constraints and the economic concerns? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So let me start, and Jeff can maybe add some color as well. But this is not being driven by inflation. Try and book
a flight. So that's not inflation. That doesn't mean that the airline prices are not a little bit higher. But not just for
T&E but just for the overall business, transactions are up. We had billings up 35%. That's not sort of driven all by
inflation, we don't have 35% of inflation. But as far as travel goes, you have to realize people have not been
traveling for probably two years. There is a tremendous pent-up demand for travel. I mean, our bookings just from
a consumer perspective on a global basis were up about 38% – 37%. In the US, they were up 48%. And that's not
over last year, that's over 2019.
So people are looking to get out there and travel, and I think that's what's driving this. That is not – it is not
inflation-driven when we look at that T&E number. The other thing I think is important with the T&E number, 121%
is a great number, but also let's put it in context. It's 121% over last year, it's not 121% over 2019. So we're not all
the way back. Consumer is back, but we're not all the way back.
As far as large corporations go, we're seeing it in our own company, people are looking to get out and not only
gather with their own colleagues but they're also looking to get out and meet with customers. You're seeing
conferences come back and so forth. And so, I know in our own company, we are getting together as a senior
management team. Our top 100, 150 people, we have some sales meetings that are going on, because people
have not seen each other, as well as you're seeing customers opening up their offices.
And I think as far as COVID affecting all of this, I think we are starting to learn to live with this. The reality is,
COVID is not something I think we've all learned that is going away. We'll wind up dealing with this as we deal
with the flu, as we deal with strep throat, as we deal with other viruses. People will continue to get – have colds
and get sick and off we'll go. But I think the world is opening back up at this point. And people are excited to go
out and see the world again, both from a business perspective and from a consumer perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I would briefly add, Sanjay, is when you think about travel and entertainment spend, some of that
increase is not so much inflation as it is a return to people buying more front of airplane or high-end hotel or high-
end restaurant oriented. Some of that is the business travel rebound where your average business travel

purchase is, of course, much higher than the average consumer purchase. The other comment I'd make going
forward is there's certainly lots of uncertainty in the world, but when you look at everything we see in our actual
results and business, you just can't really see any sign of weakness that that's causing as of today.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you for taking my question. A lot has changed since guidance was initially set, and I am curious if you
could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have been evolving since they were established. Are
there areas that made sense to lean into now versus what you thought coming into the year versus maybe pulling
back in others? Like, I guess I'm just trying to understand the flexibility in the model particularly on the expense
side in terms of as things change. What's changing under the hood even as you maintain guidance? Maybe just
give us a flavor of that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think as far as flexibility, I think, look, we demonstrated we have tremendous flexibility during the
pandemic. Especially as that related to our marketing expenditures and obviously as consumers and business
travelers didn't use our Card Member services, you saw flexibility there. So that – so those things we do have
some control over. But as far as the plan and the guidance that we have, we feel really comfortable where we are
from a $9.25 to $9.65. But more importantly, I think we feel comfortable on what we are doing day by day to make
sure that we are in line with tracking what our 2024 growth aspirations, which is a sustainable 10% revenue and
mid-teens EPS. And that's how we're running the company.
As far as what we see under the hood, we see, as Jeff mentioned, a range of good investment opportunities, and
you have to understand when we see investment opportunities from a card acquisition perspective, they are here
today and gone tomorrow. So if you don't act on them, you don't get them. And so, we will continue to drive value,
shareholder value, by continuing to invest in the business and to grow the business for the medium to the long-
term. And that's been a strategy that's worked for us, and that is going to be how we're going to run it.
But right now, if I was to look at the beginning of the year versus now, I'd probably see better investment
opportunities today than I did with the plan. But as we know, those investment opportunities, they pay back over

time, and what they do is they set us up better for 2023 and for 2024. So we feel really good about the guidance.
We feel really good about the underlying investments that we're making and we'll continue to make.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And the only sort of simple financial summary I'd put to that, Mihir, when we gave the guidance for our revenue
ambitions are quite ambitious, we feel really good about the momentum we built, but we have more investment
opportunities, as I said in my remarks, than we probably anticipated, and maybe a little bit of pressure on cost
from inflation. So, all of those things I think position us really well to build momentum towards our long-term target
of sustainable over 10% revenue growth.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
So given the expected Fed moves to cool the economy and tame inflation, like, what degree of slowing in network
volumes or billed business volumes, let's go with, do you incorporate in your outlook? And then, on the T&E side,
I know you indicated it's up nicely and continues in April, how do you view this trending as the Fed tightens and
the economy cools through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
The general comment I'd make, John, is, as you know, we don't have in-house economists, so we tend to say we
should run the economy and run our guidance to run the business when our guidance based on the
macroeconomic consensus, which is not for there to be a recession. And the Fed will say that they are certainly
focused on bringing inflation down without causing a recession. So that's what's built into our guidance and that's
how we're running the company. I think as Steve pointed out earlier, we have clearly demonstrated over the last
couple years our ability to manage the company in a very agile way and react to a scenario that's different than
what I just described. But in terms of our base levels of planning, I don't think it's our role to second-guess that
general macroeconomic consensus.

Hi, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the loan growth and the card fee growth. As you indicated, the loan growth is –
still has room to run. So maybe – and as well the impact on the NII. So maybe can you help us understand, is it
the NII that's likely to accelerate here but loan growth will be stabilizing or how are you thinking about that? And
also, how it relates to the card fees which I noticed were up nicely in the quarter. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, card fees are up because we continued to acquire more cards and we're continuing to acquire – and I think
we acquired 68% of the consumer cards we acquired were fee-based card which is still slightly below where we
were I think pre-pandemic. So what is important to understand is our card – the majority of our card fee growth
comes from new cards that we acquire. So it doesn't just come from the fee increase, but we've also had a fee
increase which will come in over time. So we feel really good about where we are from a card fee perspective.
Let me just make one comment on sort of our overall loan growth and then Jeff can get into the details. But the
reality is, pre-pandemic, we were growing slightly faster than the industry. We tend to have a lower share of our
Card Members loan wallet than we do of their spending wallet. And our intent is to grow judiciously, but we will
probably hope to get back to growing and we are growing faster than the industry, but to get our balances back
up.
But I'll let Jeff comment on the rest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I'd just emphasize the financial implication, Steve, of what you just said, which is, we are now, Betsy,
growing those lending balances faster than the industry and we absolutely expect that to continue. So there's a lot
of runway for growth on the lending side, and because of quarters like we just had with a record level of new U.S.
Platinum and Gold Cards on the consumer side and a record level of U.S. Business Platinums, I'd expect net card
fee growth to probably accelerate even further from where it is.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. So you've clearly navigated the pandemic exceptionally well and your acceleration in investment spending
couldn't have been better timed as evidenced by your customer acquisition growth. But as you look ahead from
here, I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments. Are you at all concerned over the risk that the Fed
may be forced to actually push the economy into recession to tame inflation? Does that give you any pause to be
growing aggressively into that? I mean, everything looks great now, but just would love to hear your thoughts a bit
more on how you think about that risk. And maybe if you could help us understand how you think the Amex
customer base would perform in that kind of environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, as I said earlier, we are always, in terms of our guidance, planning for what the macroeconomic consensus
has while also making sure we're thinking about other possibilities. And certainly, Bill, as just one example, we are
doing work today and making adjustments on the risk management side as we think about what the impact is of
sustained levels of inflation at its current level on different aspects of our customer base. We want to make sure
we're positioned from a risk perspective for that, although that is not the macroeconomic consensus. So I think we
demonstrated over the last couple years again our ability to be agile and manage through a downturn should that
happen. And we're trying to strike all those same balances right now.

Operator: We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Steve, I think in your prepared comments you alluded to both the new partnership with Vanguard
and also some really strong activity out of Resy. Could you just help us think through how kind of those two
initiatives really impact the top line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think the way you got to think about both of these is, we are constantly and continuously adding more
benefits and more services to the card. When you look at both of those partnerships, they unto themselves, they
do not drive top line growth. What they do, do, though, is they, in our mind, drive more engagement, drive more
retention, and give people more reason to want to be with the card.
Now, I'll just talk about Resy for a second. Resy is not only a vehicle for giving our Card Members access to
restaurant reservations and Card Members do get access to the global dining program, but it's also a card
acquisition vehicle as well because Resy is an open platform. And so Resy was all about what our – where our

Card Members spend their money and how we can integrate more with restaurants and connect our Card
Members and really take advantage of our closed loop in a different way, not just for payments but the reservation
piece and then which leads to payments.
And so when you look at the partnerships that we have that are sort of around the core of the card, and I'm not
talking about the Delta co-brand partnerships and so forth. But when you look at the other things that we do add
on, what we're constantly adding to our products are more services, better access, more experiences and so
forth, so that you continue to build the value propositions in different and more sustainable ways. And Vanguard is
an example of offering an investment service opportunity for Card Members that want to take advantage of it that
combines vanguard's digital advisor service with the personal advisor service and puts an MR component into it.
And so, we'll continue to look at other lifestyle, financial and travel and entertainment services that just add to the
overall underlying value of our card products.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Steve, maybe a question for both of you. So, Steve, you talked about the investment opportunities looking
better and then, Jeff, you talked about the potential to build reserves. So I'm assuming you're talking about
reserve dollars. And do you think we're at the bottom on the reserve rate? And also, despite recession, for you
guys, credit continues to outperform expectations. And if we do continue to see better credit, Steve, how are you
thinking about the potential to lean further into opportunities to continue to acquire cards and move towards your
aspirational targets for [indiscernible] (00:41:43).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, let me answer questions one and three, and Jeff can answer question two. So – if I remember one and
three. But, look, the reality is, is that, we continue to see good opportunities. And as those opportunities continue
to arise, we'll continue to invest in them. What's important to know is that when we make an investment, we're
making those investments through the cycle. So as we underwrite ROIs and – as we underwrite and we look at
ROIs, we feel good about what we see.
Now, why are those opportunities presenting themselves? Well, I think for a couple reasons. Number one, I think
the Premium Card space has been expanding. I think especially as you think about Gen-Zs coming into the

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
workforce, I think about millennials which are getting a bit older now, but millennials who are still gravitating to the
product. So the opportunities have arisen, I think, because the pool for our products has been getting bigger and
bigger. And we've talked about this in the past. When we used to look at people coming into our franchise, we
used to start them off on fee-free cards. Well, a lot of our fee-free cards are probably not as differentiated as
some of the others. And we have better service and so forth. But when you look at the value of the products, of
the fee-free products – the fee products that we're offering, a smart consumer and a smart small businessperson
can really generate a lot more value out of those products than they're paying for the card.
And as you know, with our value propositions, given our partner network, we work with our partners to provide
value to our Card Members, and it all works out for all three of us, the Card Member, the partner and for us. I think
the other thing that's important and you've seen a growth in small business acquisition as well is, more and more
small businesses are forming. And that's one of the structural shifts that we are taking advantage of.
And to get to the third question and Jeff can get to the second question, which if he remembers it at this point, but
to get to your third one, we take – if credit continues to perform better, we release more reserves, will we take
advantage of opportunities? We will continue to take advantage of those opportunity tis as they present
themselves. As I said, we're running this for the medium to long-term, and it really is irresponsible in my opinion of
me to pass up really good investment opportunities that will pay off over the longer term. I think one of the things
that you've seen this year is, look, we're committing to 18% to 20% revenue growth off of – basically off of a 2019
revenue base. And you've never seen that from us before. And that is a direct result of us investing in our Card
Members, investing in our brand, and not walking away from good investment opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Ryan, to come back on the credit side, maybe just to clarify my remarks. So when you look at the credit reserves
we closed the first quarter with, I would expect the dollar level of those reserves to be higher by the time you get
to the end of the year because I very much expect our IR balances to grow.
Whether the reserve rate grows is much less clear and it's probably more going to be a function of where
economic forecasts go. Could the reserve rate go lower? Well, I don't think our delinquencies or write-offs are
going to go lower, so the only thing just mechanically that could cause other reserve rates to go down would be a
dramatic improvement in the balanced economic outlook, which probably would mean all the uncertainties in the
world go away. So if magically that were to happen, I suppose it's mechanically possible the reserve rate would
go lower. But I would have to say that's pretty unlikely, sitting here.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Just on the competitive environment, I mean, we've seen a competitor come over with a new travel offering and
premium travel space is always tough, but that doesn't seem to be stopping you guys much, if at all. I'm just
wondering, can you quantify sort of the market share that you guys have taken and also speak to any potential
headwinds you're keeping an eye on in the landscape currently? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I mean, look, we – this is a competitive space when you're talking about the U.S. Consumer. It's a
competitive space. It's always been a competitive space, and it will continue to be a competitive space. And
you've got Capital One out there with a new product, and JPMorgan, all terrific companies that are looking to
double down on the premium side of it and we'll continue to – again going back to what I said when we – the
question was asked about Resy and vanguard and so forth, we're going to continue to add value to the products
and making sure that we're still top-of-mind and top of wallet. And that, look, we have record acquisitions.
However, it's still a competitive space. When you think about competition, though, we just don't think about
competition in the U.S. Consumer. We also think about it in US small business, which is competitive as well, and
you can go market by market by market both from a small business perspective. And so, there is a lot of
competition out there. We keep our eye on the competition and our objective is to continue to understand what
our customer needs are, understand where our customer needs are going, and continue to develop our products
and services.
And the reality is, you just don't – you don't launch a product and then sort of go to sleep for a few years and then
say okay in three years we'll come up with a new one. We're constantly adding value. And I think you saw that as
we added more value to the Platinum Card even after the refresh when we put the Walmart+ benefit on. So we
always assume high competition, and we always assume that the competition is really good. And that has served
us well having that mindset running the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The one thing, Steve, I'd add is I'd take people back to your discussion at Investor Day about what you call the
virtuous cycle which is the faster we can continue to grow our premium customer base, the more we're also
successful in attracting partners who want access to that base and help fund and further improve the value
proposition. And that's one of the most important ways we operate in a very competitive space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
That's a real good call-out. And remember, that virtuous cycle sits on top of an actual network, right, because
where we get those partners from are from our network, our merchant network. And so, you have this physical
merchant network and we're able to create that sort of flywheel to drive more and more value, not only of Card
Members but to partners, and the more – as Jeff said, the more premium cardholders you have and the more
value our customers get, the more they want to invest in that base.

Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. just wanted to – yeah, hi. Just wanted to double check on the net card fees and the year-on-year growth
there and the acceleration in the growth. So a bit of that being a function of new additions but also fee changes.
Should we expect a similar year-on-year trajectory for the next four quarters as you recognize some of that
revenue over time, or is this a one-time kind of bump?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A

No. So...
[indiscernible] (00:49:49)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, it's good question, Chris. As I pointed out earlier, demand has – I think I showed a chart at Investor Day.
The majority of the growth in net card fees is driven by bringing more customers into the high fee paying products,
not by any particular price increase. Although the price increases when we price or adding value-add a little bit.
When you think about the rate at which we've been bringing new Premium Card Members into the franchise,
record first quarter for U.S. Platinum, Gold, on the Consumer side and Business Platinum, that mechanically now
just makes me pretty darn confident that as you look at the next few quarters, that 16% is likely to even further
accelerate a little bit as we build on the acquisition momentum we have. Because as I think, it sounds like you
recall the accounting for fees, you're amortizing them over 12 months from when they're paid, so there's a fairly
predictable effect here.

says about operating leverage and efficiency ratio given your accelerating top line.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Well, I think the very careful word that I inserted, Rick, when we talked about sequential growth was in what we're
calling core earnings, which is why we included that pre-tax, pre-provision net income number on the first page.
Because the credit reserves are going to bounce all over the place. Although, in terms of dollars, I would expect
credit reserves at the end of the year assuming AR continues to grow as we expect to be a little bit higher. So, I
absolutely do expect pre-tax, pre-provision net income to be a little bit stronger each quarter as you go through
the year. I don't expect that necessarily of GAAP earnings per share because we just had really – we pulled
forward in many ways a good-sized credit reserve release into Q1 that drove your GAAP EPS up to $2.73. I do
not expect sequential growth off that number if you just do the simple math. That's pretty obvious given our EPS
guidance.
The other point I'd come back to is, we feel really good about the revenue momentum but, boy, Steve, I think has
made very clear our focus on pursuing good investment opportunities when they arise. And so, we're very
comfortable with the EPS guidance we've given for the year.

Lisa Ellis Q

Hi. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the new card acquisition with proprietary cards-in-force at $72.8 million. It
was up 6% year-on-year. I was just peaking back to the model, we haven't seen a quarter up 6% since back in
2018. So can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that acceleration in card acquisition? And specifically, is
that temporary? Like, the return of the Delta co-brand growth, or is it more that you're just seeing a higher ROI on
some of your card acquisition marketing spending?

Stephen J. Squeri A

Yeah, I mean, look, I think we are seeing a little bit of a higher ROI on our card acquisition spending. And as we
said, I think there's just – there's an expanding pool. It's not just the consumer base but it's also the small
business base. I'll go back to my comments before. The millennial and Gen-Z pool is expanding. There are more
small businesses out there. And as we look at the opportunities, we were able to bring in probably some more
cards than we probably were in the first quarter. And we see opportunities going forward. So we'll continue to
invest to grow the card base.

But, remember, we're looking at – we're just not looking at growing cards. These cards are hitting our return.
You've got a large percentage of these cards are fee-paying cards. But I'll also go back to – I think it's in either my
comments or in Jeff's script – 60% of the cards that we did acquire from a consumer perspective were millennial
cards which are up – which was 50% pre-pandemic. So it is a bigger pool for us to acquire it from, from a
millennial, Gen-Z perspective. And there are small businesses.
So right now, we feel good about card growth. How that translates next quarter, look, the last few quarters we've
had sequential card growth quarter to quarter. And coming off last year, look, there wasn't a tremendous amount
of card growth in the first quarter from a relative basis and a comparative basis, but it continued to move up every
single quarter. And we feel good about what happened this particular quarter. Can it be 6% again next quarter?
Don't really know.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. In SME I noticed Capital One is marketing a no limit small business card. I was just curious. I know that's
part of your secret sauce, obviously, if you thought that was material.
And then lastly, on FinTechs, like, I know you have partnerships with Bill.com and Coupa. But do they represent a
threat in any way to your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So just – I'm sorry. Just one other point for Lisa. Just, retention helps a lot. And our retention numbers, if you look
at the last couple of years, have improved significantly. So if you think about your base is having a leak in it, the
leak got a lot smaller. So, that's – I think that's important.
Don, as far as FinTechs go, I think there's some opportunities for us. And I think the partnership with i2c, we
already have a partnership with them in Latin America. And I think this will just make it easy to onboard FinTechs
that want to have American Express because the reality is a lot of them – not a lot of – most of them don't do their
own processing. They'll partner with somebody else to do this. And having i2c and being able now to do this on a
global basis will enable us to approach. So I don't look at that as a – necessarily a threat. I look at this as an
opportunity for us.
And what was the first part of your question, Don?

preset spending limit is. So we'll see how that plays out.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Again, a really good company; it had lots and lots of success; very tough competitor. They're the first ones to go
down this road, and we'll see how it all plays out, how it all plays out. But we take them very seriously as we take
everybody else. Yes, it is part of our secret sauce, and we'll see. So again, just look at the results in the first
quarter for us, we had 30% growth from a small business perspective. So we feel pretty good about small
business at this point.
