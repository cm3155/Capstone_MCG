Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the People's United Financial, Inc. Second Quarter
2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your coordinator for today.
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
for People's United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.

Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, People's United Financial, Inc.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call to review our second quarter 2020 results are,
Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters,
Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, President; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.
Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our
Investor Relations website, peoples.com\investors (sic) [peoples.com/investors] (01:32).
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.

John P. Barnes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones
are remaining safe and healthy. Before discussing results, I want to take a moment to thank our employees,
customers, and communities we serve for their perseverance and ability during this pandemic.
Since the onset of the crisis, many have said we are all in this together. This sentiment is true and reflected in the
daily interactions between our employees and customers to move forward in a socially distant environment and
through our engagement with community organizations to provide relief to those most in need. Their ability to
confront challenges together has in the past and continues today to forge and solidify relationships between
People's United and our customers. We strive to further strengthen these relationships as we play a critical role in
supporting the financial health of individuals, businesses and communities throughout this crisis and beyond.
As I mentioned last quarter, we entered this crisis in a position of strength. Our performance in the second quarter
was not only indicative of this strength, but also the resilience of the franchise. Pre-provision net revenues of $210
million on an operating basis increased 15% from the prior year quarter and benefited from higher net interest
income and ongoing success controlling costs. We also continued to produce positive operating leverage as
evidenced by a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year in the efficiency ratio to 53.5%. These results are
reflective of the material cost savings that we have achieved from recent acquisitions and help to generate a
tangible book value per share of $10.18, an increase of 7% from a year ago.
The net interest margin of 3.05% was 7 basis points lower compared to 3.12% reported in both the linked and
prior-year quarters. The margin compression mostly reflects the downward pricing of floating rate loans partially

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
offset by meaningfully lower deposits and borrowing costs. Period-end loans and deposits increased 3% and 12%
respectively linked quarter. Excluding PPP loans, loans decreased 3% largely due to lower commercial real estate
balances and our planned reduction in residential mortgages.
Deposits primarily benefited from PPP funds, federal stimulus payments and higher municipal balances. Notably,
strong deposit inflows reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio to 91% from 99% at the end of the first quarter. Clearly,
the pandemic has significantly impacted the economy. Although, as the second quarter progress, we did see a
modest uptick in business activity from the lows earlier in the period. In particular, mortgage warehouse results
continued to be strong.
As expected, residential mortgage originations were robust in our retail channel but were more than offset by
payoffs. In commercial real estate and C&I, originations remain modest. Unlike many banks, we did not
experience a high level of line draws and C&I utilization rates have remained steady. This is a reflection of the
strength of our customer base and their confidence in our ability to support their funding needs.
New business in equipment finance has been subdued with the exception of lease where we have seen signs of
increasing activity. While new business activity has been modest, our focus is on maintaining a high level of
communication with customers. We have continued to serve customers in the manner in which they want to be
served either in person with the personal social distancing protocols via our digital channels or virtually through
video meetings. This has enabled our relationship managers, branch personnel, and wealth management
advisors to successfully transact with customers and be responsive to their needs.
We are pleased that effective July 1, all of our branches return to normal operations, given the favorable
pandemic trends across our footprint. With that said, our top priority remains the health and well-being of our
employees and customers. Consistent with our history on providing support in times of need, we are committed to
helping customers navigate through this crisis.
As of July 15, we have funded nearly 18,000 PPP loans totaling over $2.6 billion, which have supported the
paychecks of more than 260,000 employees across the Northeast. Companies that received PPP loans through
us have an average of 15 employees. Some industries funded include social services, healthcare, retail,
professional services and construction. Approximately 80% of these loans were under $150,000.
We also registered for the Main Street Lending Program to further support small and mid-sized businesses.
Where appropriate, we granted loan forbearances. At quarter-end, we have approved more than 14,000 loans for
deferral totaling over $7.1 billion, comprised of $5 billion in commercial and $1.1 billion in equipment finance and
$1 billion in retail. Positively, the trends in the initial forbearance requests have slowed materially, and we have
been pleased to receive payments from 38% of the accounts, representing 19% of loan balance since they were
in deferral.
We also continue to assess the needs of customers that may require extended relief. Second round forbearance
requests are subject to a more extensive due diligence and credit analysis to confirm additional relief is needed,
as well as viability of the business in this new economic environment.
While still early in the process, based on conversations across our customer base, we expect second round
forbearance levels will be meaningfully less than the first. We believe this is a testament to our approach to
relationship banking and reflects the strong capital and liquidity profile of our customers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 3. Clearly, during the duration of the pandemic, it is unpredictable and the total impact on the
economy is unknown. However, we remain confident that our long-held underwriting philosophy and diversified
loan portfolio comprised of high-quality, cycle-tested customers will once again differentiate People's United. Our
conservative business model is advantageous especially in the challenging economic conditions. One of the
strategic objectives of our risk management is running a diversified portfolio that does not overly expose the bank
to a single line of business.
All of our relationship managers are highly credit trained and remain with customers through the entire life cycle of
the loan. This enables our sales force to develop significant knowledge of each relationship and facilitate detailed
conversations with borrowers. As such, in times of economic stress, these deep relationships allow us to quickly
transition from a new business mindset to a capital preservation focus that is empathetic with the needs of the
customer.
With that background in mind, on slide 3, we have once again provided our exposure to sectors significantly
impacted by COVID-19. Similar to last quarter, we have included the retail, hospitality and restaurant sectors. As
an update this quarter, we have refined the retail disclosure to display only loans managed by our commercial real
estate lending teams. It's important to reiterate our conservative view of underwriting enables us to enter this
crisis in a position of strength.
Credit metrics across each of our portfolios, including these sectors, were at very strong levels. Balances in the
CRE retail portfolio are $3.6 billion. Importantly, we do not have material exposure to enclosed retail malls, and
essential tenants comprise approximately half of the portfolio. These include grocery stores, pharmacies and big
box home improvement locations.
In addition, we have been pleased to see a meaningful improvement in rent collection trends for retail customers
we deemed at risk. Pre-pandemic rent collections were near 100%, but declined to 35% by the end of May. Based
on conversations with customers, we expect rent collections to be approximately 70% by the end of July.
Deferrals at quarter-end were $1.5 billion for the CRE retail portfolio. Given the portfolio's concentration of
essential tenants, we expect second deferral requests will be significantly less than the initial round.
Balances in the hospitality portfolio are $1.1 billion, of which 90% is managed by our CRE lending teams. The
majority of the portfolio is flagged by major hotel brands and comprised of economy to upper mid-scale properties.
In terms of occupancy, these properties have fared better than upscale and luxury properties across the industry.
Our top 10 clients account for over 70% of our CRE hotel exposure. Each of these sponsors are cycle-tested,
have extensive hotel experience, and are long tenured customers of People's United.
Deferrals were $876 million for the total hospitality portfolio at quarter-end. While occupancy has steadily
improved since the onset of pandemic, we expect most customers to apply for a second deferral.
Balances in the restaurant portfolio are $513 million, of which approximately 85% are managed within C&I,
including the traditional C&I and the segment's franchise finance specialized industry vertical.
The remainder of the portfolio is managed in equipment finance. The majority of the franchise portfolio is in quick
service restaurants, which have experienced a lesser degree of disruption, especially where drive-thru traffic
remains strong.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Deferrals at quarter-end were $290 million for the total restaurant portfolio. Many of our customers are coming to
an end of the first 90-day deferrals and presently, only a few have requested another round of relief.
Before moving on, it's also worth noting the continued high rent collection rates in our multifamily and office
building portfolios. The average collection rate for our top 15 multifamily loans is in the high 80% range, and in the
high 90% range for our top 15 office building loans.
Looking forward, undoubtedly, the near-term impacts of the pandemic are a top of mind for every bank's
management team. However, it is clear to us that coming years will look much different from past and therefore,
we remain keenly focused on investing in the franchise for the long term.
In particular, we are actively pursuing ways to further strengthen our digital capabilities and enhance our already
broad array of products and services offerings to meet the ever-changing needs of customers. As such, we are
excited by the recent formation of our business transformation office, which is responsible for digitization, product
strategy, management, process automation and fintech partnerships. The business transformation office is unlike
any other group we have had at People's United and will further drive our ability to innovate and re-conceptualize
offerings.
This team will not only provide a competitive advantage by enabling us to stay ahead of customer needs, but also
ensure that our strategic plan successfully advance the franchise. Consistent with the theme of meeting customer
needs, we're pleased to introduce AlwaysChecking earlier this month.
We are offering this premium digital identity protection service free to all personal checking account customers.
People's United is proud to provide this level of digital identity protection benefits that will further differentiate the
bank. This offering builds on our core value proposition of service and protection, and we are confident
AlwaysChecking will further attract and retain customers throughout the franchise.
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the second quarter results in more detail, I wanted to congratulate
Dave Berey, our now former Chief Credit Officer, whose well-planned retirement earlier this month concluded
more than 28 years with People's United. His thoughtful leadership has been instrumental to the bank, as his
many, many contributions. Thank you, Dave, for your dedication and we wish you all the best.
We are excited to welcome Rich Barry as our new Chief Credit Officer. Rich joins us from KeyCorp where he was
Chief Credit Officer. And he brings with him more than 25 years of proven experience managing risk and growing
businesses including during times of adverse conditions. His deep knowledge of our Northeast footprint and
experience working at larger peer banks, which also includes holding the role of Connecticut Market President at
Citizens will significantly benefit People's United.
With that, here is David.

Thank you, Jack. Our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year quarter were highlighted by a
15% increase in operating pre-provision net revenue and a 230 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio.
We also maintained excellent asset quality as evidenced by net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 8 basis
points.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Operating earnings of $101 million or $0.24 per common share included a provision of $80.8 million, which
reflected the continued impact of COVID-19. The $47.3 million increase in the provision linked quarter was driven
by a weaker economic forecast. Our current economic modeling reflects both a baseline economic forecast as of
late June and a more adverse scenario, which each weakened compared to the end of the first quarter given
higher unemployment, sharper GDP contraction and a longer expected recovery timeline into the first half of
2021.
On slide 4, we break down the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment. Total allowance at June 30 of
$414 million, up from $342 million at the end of the first quarter provides significant coverage as it represents
more than 12 times our annualized second quarter net charge-offs and 140% of non-performing loans. Notable
changes to segment allowance-to-loan ratios include C&I which declined 11 basis points linked quarter to 70
basis points due to the addition of PPP loans. Excluding PPP, the C&I allowance equals 89 basis points and the
total allowance is 96 basis points.
Equipment finance increased 103 basis points to 2.01%, reflective of the portfolio's shorter duration loans. The
average life of the equipment finance portfolio is approximately two years, which under CECL most cash flows do
not revert to long-term historical loss rates and makes them highly dependent on the economic scenario model.
Moving to slide 5, net interest income of $405.6 million increased $9.6 million or 2% from the first quarter. The
loan portfolio unfavorably impacted net interest income by $38.3 million. In addition, lower yields in the securities
portfolio reduced net interest income by $3.2 million. These headwinds were more than offset by lower deposit
and borrowing costs which benefited net interest income by $37.2 million and $13.9 million respectively. Of note,
net interest income benefited approximately $12 million from PPP during the quarter, which reflects $9 million in
related fees and $3 million in net interest income.
As displayed on side 6, net interest margin of 3.05% was 7 basis points lower than the first quarter. The loan
portfolio negatively impacted the margin by 40 basis points, driven by the downward repricing of floating rate
loans. In addition, lower security yields reduced the margin by 7 basis points. Partially offsetting these negative
effects, was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing and lower borrowing costs, which favorably
impacted the margin by 29 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively.
Across the franchise, our line of business leaders did a remarkable job working with customers and managing
deposit costs lower. Average deposit costs were 34 basis points in the second quarter compared to 71 basis
points in the first quarter, while borrowing costs improved 115 basis points over the same period.
The net impact on the margin from PPP was negligible in the second quarter as the loans were not on the books
for the full three months. Looking ahead, we expect PPP will have approximately a 3 basis point unfavorable
impact on the margin in each of the next two quarters.
Turning to loans on slide 7, average balances were up $1.7 billion or 4% in the first quarter while period end loans
increased $1.2 billion or 3%. Growth on both an average and period end basis was concentrated in the C&I
portfolio driven by the addition of PPP loans and strong mortgage warehouse results. Average balances also
benefited from equipment finance due to the continued growth in lease.
It is important to note in connection with United Bank core system conversion in early April, approximately $400
million of loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties were prospectively reclassified from
commercial real estate to C&I. Excluding PPP, loans declined on both an average and period end basis.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Average loans decreased $66 million or less than 1% from the first quarter. While period end balances were down
$1.3 billion or 3%. The largest driver of the decline in period end loans was a $458 million reduction in residential
mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios.
In addition, adjusting for the reclassification, middle market C&I was down over $280 million, while CRE and asset
based lending balances declined approximately $250 million and $190 million, respectively.
Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio which is in run-off mode ended the
quarter at $621 million, down $71 million linked quarter and $116 million year-to-date. In addition, the period end
balance for the United loans we have chosen to run-off was $962 million, a decline of $80 million from March 31
and $151 million since yearend. We continue to expect run off of $200 million to $300 million for each of these
portfolios for the full year.
Moving onto deposits on slide 8, average balances were up $4.3 billion or 10% from the first quarter. While period
end deposits increased $5.2 billion or 12%. Growth on both an average and period end basis was primarily driven
by inflows of PPP funds and federal stimulus payments as well as higher municipal balances, notably a $2.8
billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was the largest driver of the higher average balances in the
quarter.
At June 30, non-interest-bearing deposits accounted for more than 27% of total period end balances, up from
23.5% at the close of the first quarter. Looking forward, as customers further utilize PPP funds and federal
stimulus payments, we anticipate deposit balances to abate in the second half of the year.
Our funding and liquidity profile remains strong with a secured borrowing capacity of $13.3 billion at quarter-end,
comprised of $6.8 billion in federal home loan bank capacity, $3.2 billion in unpledged securities, and $3.3 billion
in Federal Reserve Bank pledged loans.
Looking at slide 9, non-interest income of $89.6 million was down $34.2 million or 28%, strong first quarter results.
The largest driver of the decline was a $15.1 million in lower net gains from sale of loans. As a reminder, the first
quarter included a $16.9 million gain related to the sale of loans acquired in the United transactions.
Excluding gains on the net sale of loans, non-interest income decreased $19.1 million and was primarily driven by
lower levels of customer activity and fee waivers related to COVID-19 relief measures. Specifically, this decline
reflected a $7.7 million decrease in bank service charges inclusive of fee waivers, $6.1 million in lower customer
interest rate swap income, $1.9 million in lower insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial
insurance renewals, and a $1.5 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees primarily due to lower loan
prepayment fees in equipment finance. Overall, the net impact on non-interest income in the second quarter from
fee waivers was approximately $4.7 million.
On slide 10, non-interest expense of $304 million declined $16.1 million linked quarter. The second quarter
included $18.5 million of non-operating costs, up $600,000 from the first quarter and were in the following
categories; $13.7 million in other non-interest expense, primarily driven by branch closures related to the United
transaction; $3.6 million in professional and outside services; $1 million in compensation and benefits; and
$200,000 in occupancy and equipment. Excluding non-operating cost, non-interest expense of $285.2 million was
down $16.7 million or 6% compared to the first quarter.
The largest driver of this improvement was a $6.7 million decline in compensation and benefits due to lower
payroll and healthcare-related costs. Occupancy and equipment costs were favorable by $2.7 million. Travel and

meeting-related expenditures were lower by $2.4 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. And
advertising and promotion and professional and outside services costs collectively decreased net interest
expense by $2.9 million, primarily as a result of timing.
Briefly on slide 11, you can see the efficiency ratio improvement compared to the prior year quarter. Our 53.5%
efficiency ratio is a product of our ability to generate positive operating leverage and in particular realize the
projected cost take-outs from acquisitions. As referenced earlier, we sustained excellent asset quality and
answered the pandemic in a position of strength.
As displayed on slide 12, net loan charge offs to average total loans were 8 basis points, an improvement of 2
basis points from the first quarter. Non-performing assets as a percentage of loans and REO of 69 basis points
was 10 basis points higher linked quarter. This increase was primarily driven by two accounts. One represented a
C&I account which was experiencing difficulties prior to the pandemic. The other was an acquired commercial real
estate loan.
Turning to slide 13, return on average assets of 58 basis points or 65 basis points on an operating basis and
return on average tangible common equity of 8.1% or 9.5% on an operating basis were down compared to recent
quarters. The decline in these returns in the second quarter was primarily driven by the elevated provision
resulting from the impact of COVID-19.
Finally, on slide 14, we remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital ratios
continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. It's
important to note adjusting for PPP loans, the pro forma Tier 1 leverage ratio at period end would be 8.3% for the
holding company and 8.7% for the bank. Additionally the TCE ratio excluding PPP would be 7.6% versus the
reported 7.3%.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're
ready for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your question. [Operator Instructions]
And your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great thanks. Good evening, guys.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess the first question just in terms of the PPP loans. If I heard correctly you're expecting a 3 basis points
negative hit to NIM over the next couple quarters due to the PPP loans. I'm kind of assuming that there's
obviously no accelerated payoffs in there and you're probably not assuming anything other than this two-year pay-
off I guess or full amortization of these loans. But even under those assumptions like your NIM is call it roughly
3%.
I think most of the banks we're hearing from say, the fully, I guess, amortized yield or the full yield on these loans
are something over 3%, assuming that with any kind of accelerated payoffs. I'm just trying to understand like why
is this a negative to your NIM. Like what are you assuming in terms of like the loan yields with the payoffs that is
resulting in such a low – or a hit? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. Sure, Ken. So, I mean, you're correct. We're basically assuming that the vast majority of those loans will be
on for two years. There's a few that could possibly go by just at the tail end. I would say the average loan is about
2.75% under those assumptions, average loan yield. The reason we made the statement negligible in the first
quarter, it was a small negative. The only difference – I'm sorry, second quarter, not first quarter – the only real
difference between second quarter versus third and fourth is that the loans weren't all on the books for the full
quarter in Q2, but we assumed they will be in Q3 and Q4.

Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point
Good evening. Just a quick one on the credits. It's really encouraging to hear your expectations on the retail CRE
collections. I was just wondering what you guys are hearing from your customers that gives you confidence that,
that collection rate is going to effectively – if I heard correctly, double by the end of July. Are you getting like
weekly cash flow data from these guys or seeing anything else? Any color there would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, we're having a lot of conversation with customers across all of our businesses, and in that particular
area our real estate group, you know, collected data from those conversations with customers and information.
And that was kind of tabulated, carried forward. I don't know if you want to describe that Jeff any differently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
No, I think that's right, Jack. What we've been doing is having real robust conversations with all of our commercial
real estate customers in particular focusing on places like, you know, retail. And so the comments we're making is
kind of a – just a collection of all of the information we're hearing back from our customers. They have seen
increasing trends in rent collections. Of course, it's difficult to predict what the second half of the year looks like.
But as we sit here today, they've been steadily increasing since the start of the pandemic. So clearly in a much
better position today than they were three months ago.

done something, but we're not impacted yet that very low. So there's nothing showing up in our acquired portfolios
that are changing those numbers.

Dave Rochester Q

Okay. Great. And maybe just one last one on expenses. Obviously there's some good expense control this
quarter. Just wondering what, what you're thinking about for the puts and takes of the expense run rate going
forward and if this is a good run rate just excluding all the charges and whatnot? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure, Dave, I'll take that. So, the way I would think about it is as you know we gave guidance in January,
guidance around expenses was $1.190 billion to $1.220 billion. Our thinking today is that we'll be right around the
lower end of that guidance by the time the year is all said and done.

John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting with credit can you give an update on what you're seeing from deferral levels as we've entered
here in July? And it seems like most other places are seeing pretty substantial declines. Do you have any updated
numbers on where deferral stands either today or recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, we're – well, I guess, we'd say we're cautiously optimistic. We – Jeff just described those conversations
that we're having across the businesses and it certainly includes the people that got deferrals when we were 16%
overall and the deferral level, which I think reflected our trying to be very accommodating to our customers at that
initial phase. Most of the deferrals were granted in late March, early April. And so, right now, and as we speak,
there's a pretty significant number of those conversations have taken place in the last 30 days to try to gauge and
anticipate how many will be asking for a second. And we mentioned in our comments we think the hospitality
group definitely will need it. And we'll definitely accommodate them. We've been talking to them regularly and
they're, as you described, very good long-term customers. So, we want them in the properties.
And the other kind of broader levels there, we would say I think it's going to be meaningfully below 50% in terms
of second requests. In a lot of the portfolios, we're not anticipating lifts at all. So the conversations have been
positive. Many, many people have told us now that they've gotten through the initial shock and they've kind of
reevaluated their operation and the impact there, they won't be asking for a second deferral. So, I would say we
feel pretty good about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great color. When you look at the ones that you're more concerned about or that may need a longer-
term deferral, would you be more inclined to try to come up with some type of a formal restructuring and move it
off of deferral by year-end or would you be more inclined to utilize the longer duration deferral that the CARES Act
allows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So if we were to grant that second deferral, then we're hitting that 180 days, which we would use I would
say. And then during that period, we'd be evaluating what kind of restructuring if any is needed. So, I would say
different types of businesses, different types of properties, it's probably kind of difficult to describe what kind of
restructuring we'd do. But we would use the 180 day period and then we would kind of have to go from there,
unless the regulators and accountants extend that period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just finally from me, when you look at the equipment finance and having to put a big CECL
provision on that, does that really make it less attractive to put on any new equipment finance loans right now or

would you still be putting on equipment finance loans today even though you may have to put a bigger provision
associated with that day one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. I would – I'll give you an answer, and I'll let David or Jeff contribute. First of all, know that doesn't
discourage me at all with the lease and the equipment finance groups. They are actually performing very well.
They're doing well. Their credit history is really, really good. It's much better than the industry. And I really have no
reason to think that the performance isn't going to continue. This is kind of a case where CECL drives you
because of the short duration period and the economic scenario to that higher provision. Once things calm down,
hopefully they do, then that requirement will be – for higher provisions will be reduced and we'll recover provisions
in my mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that's the perfect answer, Jack. It's just it's one of those nuances of CECL similar to we're
carrying a reserve for residential mortgage larger than we think you need to but that's driven by the long duration
of the assets where it's the opposite with the equipment financing right now.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
I would say essentially all of the reserve build was due to economic scenario modeling. The – there are qualitative
overlays as part of our process, but the drive – that's not – wasn't really the driver, it was just a as we referenced
in our comments, a weaker economic forecast than last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q

Thank you. And on to fees, just one question on the $4.7 million waived fees you mentioned. Can you talk about

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. So the – similar to forbearance, in the first round, we try to be as accommodating as possible to our
customer base to help them through this time period of economic uncertainty. We saw a – as the quarter
unfolded, there was a reduction in fee waivers given across and this is mostly our retail base, though they were
still occurring as late as June. So, I would expect the impact to be substantially lasts in Q3 than what you saw in
Q2.

about that on the call last quarter.

Steven Duong Q

highest fees.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then just the last one, you guys – the reserves are based on the latest economic forecast. So, I guess
is it fair to say if the economic forecast – if the actual economy plays out similar to what the economic forecasts
are right now, then your provisioning should go back to what it was before?

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of William Wallace with Raymond James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. I just had two brief questions on deferrals. You've stated that the experience, or
you're optimistic that the tier rates will be high. On the deferrals that have come due or rolled off a deferral and
then have had a payment, what percentage of those have made their next payment versus gone to a second
round?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, most of the activities for the first deferral kind of would have just ended in the month of June, then we had
this July thing, so we've only had the opportunity to see one payment, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
You've only had one loan that's come up to a payment, is that what you're saying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
No, I'm saying the loans that have gone into deferrals that are just coming out, they're just coming out in July, so I
thought you asked if they're going to make a second payment and I'm saying that we haven't had an opportunity
to see the second payment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
No, no I'm sorry. I'm saying what percentage have made the next payment, their first payment after coming off of
the ones that have come up on that payment due date?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
No, they're just coming off now. So, this is the first month. And so, yeah, we don't – to me, that – we'll know that
month. What I would focus – I think what's probably more important is in Jack's comment, he referenced, of the
deferrals we granted while loans were in deferral, approximately 40% of the accounts and 20% of the balances
chose to pay even though we granted deferrals. And he also said that we think the amount of deferrals will
significantly decrease and will probably be less than half the original deferrals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Okay. So, okay, yeah. As you think about reserve builds and can those loans that do go onto a second
deferral, do you think that – would you anticipate you'd have some continued though milder reserve builds due to
downgrades of those loans?

Yeah. What I would go back to is the level of provision expense, primarily governed by the economic scenario,
right? Number one. Levels of – a lot of the kind of metric data that goes into our models, some of our models are
dependent on internal risk rating, but not all of them.

Collyn Gilbert Q

So, just to start on the borrowing pay down. So, that was a pretty dramatic pay down in the quarter there and,
obviously, really meaningfully reduced the cost. I think you're probably down to like 27 basis points on borrowing
costs. David, how is that setting up the margin for the third quarter? And then what was kind of the strategy or the
reasoning behind that, or at what point did you decide to kind of pull the trigger on paying down those
borrowings?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
It's good question, Collyn. What I would say is most of our treasury borrowing book, we tend to keep relatively
short. So, it was – we could just naturally pay it off. We didn't have to extinguish home loan, bank borrowings or
anything like that. So, you make a decision to either balloon the balance sheet, right, or just kind of let that deposit
inflows pay down those borrowings, which is what we chose. You did see a small increase in cash and due on the
balance sheet, so we did have higher levels of cash with the Federal Reserve.nBut the more important part of the
question I think is how that set up the margin for the back half of the year.
We were very successful in deposit costs, lowering them. There's still some opportunities, though not as great,
from Q1 to Q2. It will be – we have less opportunity obviously from Q2 to Q3 and Q4. Probably, the biggest driver
will be just our CD books, pricing down, as well as customer preference is for liquidity. So, we saw balances go
from CDs in the money markets and checking accounts as well. So, we still have some positive tweaking to do
there, some natural roll on the deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just the timing of the borrowing pay down I guess is another kind of part two of that question to
determine what the impact might be in the third quarter on the NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean it's – the level of borrowing – if the deposit inflows growth that we had roughly stays the same, the
borrowing base isn't going to change unless – it's really going to be dependent on loan growth in the back half of
the year. We have robust loan growth or even better loan growth, mild to up loan growth, there will be a funding
need.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I thought Collyn was trying to ask how rapidly we paid down the borrowings during the second quarter. Was that
it, Collyn?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Just to see where the – yeah, where are the savings, right. I mean if you're starting at – I think you started
borrowings at 142. In the first quarter, they dropped to 27 basis points. So is that – just trying to understand this,
yeah, how much more savings could be seen in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Those borrowings came down and they were more front-loaded in the quarter than back-loaded.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Number one, we're driven by the PPP loans coming in, because that money sat there, and then lastly by the
stimulus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sorry about that, Collyn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No. No. No, that's okay. That's okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then just going back to credit. So I know this has
been asked a lot, but just curious, I think it was probably as late in the quarter as maybe early June where I
thought the view was perhaps consistent with what you guys said following one quarter that that provision would
likely kind of be in the same range in the second quarter as it was in the first quarter.
And I guess if we look at where the economy was in early June while maybe you had not implemented your actual
economic forecast at that point, I guess, just qualitatively, I'm just trying to connect the dots there, because I
thought the messaging in early June was that the provision would be comparable to first quarter and yet obviously
it came in meaningfully higher. So beyond the economic model input, anything else there that changed that
viewpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, I mean from my perspective on the call in April, we were telegraphing slightly up, is the way I would
characterize it. We left open the possibility for a higher provision in Q2. June economic data is really the driver
here, but it was definitely weaker than March.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Okay. And then lastly, I think if I'm doing the math right and if the numbers are right, I thought after
the first quarter you had indicated there was like about $6.2 million – I'm sorry, $6.2 billion of loans you identified
kind of as risky. And then in the release and the deck this quarter, it looks like $5.2 billion. And it looks like the
drop was on the retail CRE side. Did something happen within that book that you maybe would characterized it...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey A. Hoyt A
Chief Accounting Officer & Senior Vice President, People's United Bank NA (Bridgeport, Connecticut)
Yeah. That was actually Jack alluded to in his comments. So we find the definition of commercial retail – of retail
CRE, and we were too broad in hindsight in Q1. So what we – the number we're focusing on is the – what is
managed by our commercial real estate lending teams. There was some middle market CRE in the first quarter
number.

Hi, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Sorry if I missed it, but did you – could you just characterize for us what the core NIM might look like both in the
medium and really like a year out from now? If interest rates were to be unchanged, what could the core NIM
migrate to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Leave it to you to ask the hardest question. While we've suspended guidance because of the fluidity of the
situation, what I would say Matt is there's clearly more forces taking the NIM down than the NIM up. So, shape of
the yield curve, that policy, I think consensus is rates aren't really going to change or go up anytime soon. So
there's definitely pressure on the NIM.
In the quarter, I think we were very successful in managing deposit costs. I tried to say and answer to Collyn's
questions that we still have some more to do on the deposit cost side, but it's not nearly as much as we were able
to do in the second quarter.
The loan spreads held up in the quarter, but there wasn't a lot of volume. If the situation gets worse, the economy
gets worse, credit spreads are going to widen. So when you have opportunities, we will lend to small customers,
we will be lending at wider spreads. So I don't want to talk about where we think NIM might be in 2021 at this
point, but I can see the NIM falling below 3%, obviously, and I could see it in the – a 2.90%, 2.80-ish type range
over time.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Understood. Okay. And then to what extent did loans on deferral contribute to net interest income this quarter?
And just hypothetically speaking, if deferrals were to go to non-performing asset, would therefore be backed out of
NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I'm sorry, Matt. I missed that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Well, the loans on full deferral, you're not collecting principal or interest, yet you're accruing the interest in net
interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Right.

To what extent did that impact the NIM this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So it was in – it's in the NIM. So, as you stated, we – they are on deferral but we're accruing that interest. So it
really didn't have an impact on the NIM in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then my last one is just on – could you provide some color on your goodwill impairment evaluation
process and whether or not that's necessary at this point? And then, practically speaking, if there is the need to
take in an impairment, would that factor in to your ability to pay the dividend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
A couple questions there. What I would say is, obviously, as part of each quarter, we think about goodwill
impairment and whether it's necessary. The factors that we discuss that – as we go down that path internally and
in talks with our outside accountants is that the factors aren't present for goodwill impairment for us to have to go
and do a full analysis. That's driven by the fact that there is – I think the last time we saw the full assessment,
there were large cushions in goodwill. So, we don't think that's an event that's – I mean obviously, we have to go
through the process each quarter, but it is not something we're expecting as we sit here today. So, I'd rather not
speculate on if that happened, what impact that might have on the ability to pay a dividend.

Okay. Understood. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.
