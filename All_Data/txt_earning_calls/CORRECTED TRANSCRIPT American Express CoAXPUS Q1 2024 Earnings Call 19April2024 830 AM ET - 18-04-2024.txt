Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you. Q1 was another strong quarter with revenues up 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion and EPS up 39%
to $3.33. The trends we've seen for the past several years continued through the first quarter of 2024. Our
double-digit revenue increase was driven by strong spending growth, up 7% overall on an FX-adjusted basis with
US consumer card spending up 8% in the quarter and spending from international card members up 13% on an
FX-adjusted basis.
Spending by US SME card members continued to be soft but new customer acquisitions, retention and credit on
our small business products all continue to be strong. Fee revenues again grew by double-digits, up 16% on an
FX-adjusted basis.
We continue to attract high-spending, high credit quality customers to the franchise with new card acquisitions
accelerating quarter-over-quarter, adding 3.4 million new cards in the quarter. Our fee-based products accounted
for approximately 70% of the new account acquisitions globally and we continue to see strong demand for
Millennial and Gen Z consumers, who accounted for over 60% of the new consumer account acquisitions globally.
Finally, our credit metrics continue to be best-in-class.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
The ongoing momentum in our business is the result of the great work of our colleagues across the company and
the loyalty and engagement of our premium customers around the world. Based on our performance and the
trends we've seen through the first quarter, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of 9% to 11% revenue
growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. Our first quarter results continue to show that our strategy is working and
we feel good about where we are and where we are heading.
In 10 days, we'll be hosting our 2024 Investor Day. At that session, we'll have a series of presentations from our
senior business leaders that taken together will demonstrate why we are confident that our long-term growth
aspiration is the right one. We will discuss our strategy for growing our premium consumer base in the US through
our membership model, our plans for winning the recovery in the US small business space, our runway for growth
in international, our progress in expanding merchant coverage and enhancing our network capabilities globally,
how we're driving efficiency, growth and service through technology and how it all comes together from a financial
perspective. We'll end our Investor Day with a Q&A session.
Christophe will now take you through a detailed look at Q1 performance.

Christophe Le Caillec
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about the first quarter results, which
reflect another quarter of strong results and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year.
Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. First quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-
over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.4 billion and earnings per share of $3.33.
On slide 3. Billed business grew 7% versus last year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with the
overall spend environment we have seen in the past few quarters as we expected. Looking by category, we saw
6% growth in goods and services spending and 8% growth in travel and entertainment spending. There are a few
other key points to takeaway as we then breakdown our spending trends across our businesses.
Starting with our largest segment on slide 4. US Consumer grew billings at 8% this quarter with growth across all
generations and age cohorts. Millennial and Gen Z customers grew their spending 15% and continued to drive
our highest billed business growth within this segment. In fact, we see that younger customers use their cards
more overall, and this is even more pronounced in certain spend categories. For example, customers aged 35
and under use their cards at restaurants over 70% more on average than other customers in this segment.
Looking at Commercial Services on slide 5. Overall growth came in at 2% this quarter. Spending growth from our
US small and medium size enterprise customers remain modest, given unique dynamics seen by small
businesses.
Lastly on slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services up 13%. We
continue to see double-digit growth in spending from International consumers and from International SME and
large corporate customers as well as strong growth across our geographies.
Overall, while we do continue to see a softer spend environment, our spending volumes are tracking in line with
our expectations to support our revenue guidance for the full year and we are pleased with a continued strong
engagement of our customers as the number of transactions from our card members continued to grow double-
digits this quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Now moving on to loans and card members receivables on slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth at 12%. As we
progress through 2024, we continue to expect this growth to moderate but to still grow modestly faster than
billings.
Turning next to credit and provision on slide 8 through 10. First, and most importantly, we continue to see strong
and best-in-class credit metrics, we attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our
robust risk management practices and our disciplined growth strategy. As we expected, our write-off and
delinquency rates ticked up a bit, increasing very modestly quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect to see
these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with some continued modest increase in 2024.
Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan
balances, combined with a modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate, resulted
in a $148 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.3 billion of provision
expense in the first quarter.
As you see on slide 10, we ended the first quarter with $5.6 billion in reserves, representing 2.9% of our total
loans and card member receivables. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through
2024, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters.
Moving next to revenue on slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our largest
revenue line, discount revenue, grew 6% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on slide
12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fees revenues were up
16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 13. We are pleased with
this growth and continue to expect to exit the year with some further momentum reflecting our cycle of product
refreshes.
In the quarter, we acquired 3.4 million new cards, demonstrating the demand we're seeing for our products and
the investments we've made. Importantly, acquisition of our premium fee-based products accounted for around
70% of new accounts, and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look
strong.
Moving on to slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 26% year-over-year in Q1. This growth is
driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year.
We do expect this growth to continue to moderate as we move through the year, and I would remind you that, for
our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment this
year.
To sum up, revenues on slide 15. The power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue growth
momentum. I would note, as you think about the CFPB late fee rule, that late fees from our US Consumer
segment make up a small portion, less than 1%, of our overall revenue. While we have no specific plans to
mitigate as of now, we are always looking at our pricing and policies in the ordinary course of business.
Moving to expenses on slide 16. Starting at the top of the page, variable customer engagement expenses came in
at 40% of total revenues for the first quarter. As you look at these costs, I would note that card member rewards
included a $196 million benefit as a result of enhancements to our remodels for estimating future Membership
Rewards redemptions, some of which we reinvested for growth in our marketing line.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Looking forward, I still expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our
revenue on a full-year basis, as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our
card members.
On the marketing line, we increased investments to $1.5 billion in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with
a strong, high-quality customer acquisition and engagement we see as a result of these actions, and we are on
track to increase marketing spend in 2024 versus last year.
Moving to the bottom of slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the first quarter, flat to
last year's expense, and in line with our expectations for the year. When you look at the components of our
operating expenses, salaries and benefit grew modestly versus last year, compared to the growth we've seen in
this line over the past years. This reflected discipline with which we manage our expenses and is a great example
of how we're able to drive efficiency while continuing to grow our business. We continue to see OpEx as a key
source of leverage and are focused on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done.
Turning next to capital on slide 17. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter on the
back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the first quarter, within our target
range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while
supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital
management approach.
That brings me to our 2024 guidance on slide 18. We feel really good about our first quarter results which are
tracking in line with our expectations for the year. These results continue to reinforce that our strategy is working
and we plan to continue to invest to support our momentum. As Steve discussed, for the full year 2024, we are
reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and
$13.15 and we remain committed to running the business for the long term.
As a reminder, this guidance and the items related to the full year 2024 that I just walked through, do not include
the potential impact from the sale of our certified business that we previously announced. We expect to realize a
sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business, as we've done
with similar transactions in the past. We still expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide
more detail then.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open up the call for your questions.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. I guess a question for both Steve and Christophe. Christophe, you said that you guys
are seeing a softer spending environment. I'm just curious, when you look at the data, what's driving that? Is it
inflation? Is it just a bit of tapering off after the post-pandemic spending? And I'm just curious as we think about
what gets that going again. What is it? Obviously, the comparisons get easier as well, so that should help, but
maybe you could just walk through that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, let me start and then Christophe can jump in, but when you look at overall spending, our overall spending is
7%, but consumer spending is 8%, and I think consumer spending is relatively strong and when you look at
international, international consumer spending is up 14% and overall, international is up 13%.
Where you're seeing some softness is in SME, so SME is up approximately 1% and so I think as SME comes
back which we look at as an opportunity down the road, as SME comes back that'll drive some stronger spending
and I think the good things that we see from an SME perspective is that we're still acquiring cards, credit looks
really good, and even though organic has come down, organic transactions have gone up, so I think in aggregate,
we see softness, and I think a lot of that softness is driven from a commercial perspective, but 8% consumer
growth in the US is not too bad.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the Membership Rewards expense. It looks like there's a little bit of a change there with
model announcements so can you just talk about that a little more? Did the estimate for the URR, the redemption
rates change from the 96% at year-end? Should we think of this on a $96 million benefit as a one-time thing or is
that going to be the news?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Hey, Mihir. Thanks for the question. So you should think about it as a one-time thing, and the URR is 96%. It's still
at 96%. What we do is because it's such an important model for us, we, on a regular basis, redevelop the model
and every time we redevelop the model, we try to enhance the model so we feed the model with more data, and
try to refine their URR calculation.
That's exactly what happened and when we did that in Q1, we came back with a little bit of the benefit. I say a
little bit because you have to remember that the entire Membership Rewards bank is about $14 billion, so it's a bit
less than $14 billion, so $196 million is very small compared to the size of the balance sheet and so it's a one-off
and we don't expect something similar any time soon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark DeVries Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Could you discuss what drove the reacceleration in the new card growth this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so we invested more and I think when you go back and you look at the first quarter of last year, we had 3.4
billion – 3.4 million, excuse me, 3.4 billion would be a pretty sizable amount of cards to acquire in the quarter, 3.4
million cards acquired and if you remember at that time you had the SVB situation, and so it was a pullback. It
was not only a pullback on our side. There was a little bit of a pullback in the industry, and I think there was some
consumer trepidation as well, and so as the year went on, we started to build up and it culminated this year with in
the first quarter of 3.4 million cards.
We invested more in marketing as we said we were going to do, but I'd also like to highlight that a key driver of
that acceleration is the product refreshes that we do. We've talked a lot how product refreshes really stimulate
demand, and how it makes our marketing dollars work a lot harder and so we had the Delta product refreshes, we
had product refresh in Japan, we had a Hilton small business card, we had a British Airways card and we're on
our way to those 40 product refreshes that we talked about and what product refreshes do, they do stimulate
demand and it stimulates upgrades and so forth, so that's really what's behind the increase sequentially of cards
quarter-over-quarter, but we're sort of back to where we were at this time last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I would add, Mark, is as we increase the MCA, the percentage of new cards that are coming at a
fee-paying product remains stable at about 70%, so it talks about the quality of these 3.4 million new cards.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Sorry. So what I was saying was with the, what seems to be firmer macro assumptions for second and third
quarter and the rewards benefit, how come EPS guide was held flat. I'm assuming there's probably a bigger buffer
in there and second, if you could comment on what the trends have been in your loan workout program. Have you
been seeing higher, lower additions to that program and how's progress been in terms of getting consumers on
good payment plans and maintaining them? Thanks.

So wanted to ask about the assumptions later in the deck. It looks like you're assuming a firmer economic
environment for quarters two and three. So taking that with the benefit on rewards, should we assume there's a
larger buffer built into your guide because you didn't raise EPS guide? And second, along the same lines, I
wanted to ask about your loan workout program. Are you seeing any change in terms of the pace of loans being
added or loans being worked out and how loans are progressing through that program? Thanks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Okay. Hey. Good morning, Craig. Under how we think about the balance of the year. So, with – I just want to say,
we're going to stick to our EPS guidance. We're not going to change that range at this point in time. There's still a
lot of things that need to play out in the balance of the year, and we think that that guidance best represent what
we expect at this point in time.
Specifically about how to think about that URR benefit. As I've said in my prepared remarks, I would say that a
significant portion of that benefit was reinvested on the marketing line. We knew – we saw that benefit coming in
the quarter and we took advantage of that as well to dial up the marketing. So all in all, it doesn't have a
meaningful impact on EPS for the full year.
When it comes to the – what we call the financial relief program and the modified loans, so this is an important
program for us. We have, we think, one of the best program in the industry. We have [ph] Innovative (00:27:21).
For instance, we have a short-term program. We are also in that short-term program enabling the card members
to retain some spend capacity and usage of the product. So we really think that it's a differentiator to help the card
members that are experiencing stress. So that program is working really well for us. It's very effective, and what I
can say is that the enrollment in the program has moderated in Q1 and that the performance of the card members
within this program is very, very strong.
We have a ton of metrics. One of the metrics we've talked about in the past was we're looking at payment loyalty
and how much the card members who are in delinquent status or paying us versus paying our peers, and we like
what we're seeing, right? We're typically front of their wallet in terms of repayments and it's definitely contributing
to the strong credit metrics that you've seen.
We think it's also consistent with our brand in terms of being there for our card members and having their backs.
So that program is working well, but just to be specific on your question, the enrollment in this program is
moderating in Q1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. So I guess I'm going to ask about the Visa and
Mastercard settlement, the reduction in interchange rates and then some steering mechanisms. And I know
historically, given your premium brand and so forth, those actions haven't had any impact on the business, but we
haven't talked about that for a while, so I'm wondering if you guys just have some updated thoughts about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, it's really hard to say how it's going to play out over time. I mean, this has been going on probably close to
20 years, and it still has to be approved the courts, and we'll see, but what I would say is it really doesn't change
sort of our strategy in any way. We're still focused on premium customers. Our customers still engage with the
products. We'll demand to use the products and we'll still maintain our virtual parity, so we'll see how it all plays
out but we're going to continue to focus on what we control and the only other thing I would say is that our pricing
is policies and structures are fundamentally different than the networks.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Good. Yeah, just wanted to ask the prior comments you made last quarter about the card refresh plans for
this year, 40 card products. I think from a quick [indiscernible] (00:32:25) and it seems like you've done eight so
far this year with Delta health and maybe a card in India. Is that right and maybe you can just talk a little bit about
trajectory over the rest of the year, cadence over the rest of the year, and what the response has been to some of
those refreshes so far. I think more notably, the big Delta one you did earlier this year would be interested to hear
the response you've seen from customers so far on that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So the product refreshes will go out through the year. We don't really talk about exactly when they're going
to be released, but you can rest assured, all 40 or approximately 40 will be done. You know, it's a little early to tell
on the refreshes, as it's still in the early stages here but what I would say from a Delta reserve perspective, it has
really, really gone well, probably beyond our expectations, so that is – it's a great product. We raised the fee $100
and added over $500 worth of $560 worth of value, so that's going well, and as I said, the proof will be in the
pudding because refreshes really do help to drive demand. It drives awareness.
It not only – and it drives more engagement with existing cardholders, and it's been a strategy that has worked
very, very well for us over the last number of years, and it's one that we're committed to on a go forward basis

because it's not only important to again drive demand but you really want to reignite and reengage with the base,
and what we really do is we look at what our customers really want, and make sure that we're adding that value
that makes the most sense to them.

your question.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Steve, it ties in with what you were just talking about. When we
think about the lifecycle of a customer, its acquisition, its engagement, and then ultimately its loyalty and
retention, and I think the real strength of American Express is on the loyalty retention side. When you talk about
refresh, that's acquisition and engagement. Can you talk about what you're doing, investing on the back office
side as the portfolios growing so quickly to make sure that you maintain the loyalty and retention aspect of the
business as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think it truly is a virtuous cycle and I think you've got it right. It's important to obviously acquire cards and
then as you acquire a card, you really want to engage them and get those cardholders spending in as many areas
as they can, and so you look at this ramp-up period over maybe a 0 to 24 month period, and then at that point in
time, what's important is that we are engaging with the customer as a customer who is embedded within the
franchise, and part of our marketing dollars not only goes to acquiring new customers but we look at how people
are spending. We look at how they're spending relative to other people like them, and that's where you'll see
offers to either upgrade cards, line increases, other products that we have, and so it's that constant engagement.
It's the analytics that go behind it that really leads to the retention, what you cannot do is once you have
somebody, you just can't let them be stagnant and so there's a lot of learning out of our commercial business and
out of our merchant business where we have tremendous account managers, and that work with our clients on a
daily basis, weekly basis, to help them grow their spend.
Now obviously with tens of millions of consumer card members, you can't do that necessarily, personally all the
time but you can do that through communicating through the channels that we have and another big part of our
value proposition and our service proposition is when people do call into us, our customer care professionals are
able to look at their spending, look at how they're doing, and offer them other opportunities to really grow with us,
either from again from a lending perspective or from a card upgrade perspective, so I think it's really important
what happens on that back office as that continues to fuel that virtuous cycle.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Although you mentioned, Christophe, that the rewards benefit was one-off, are you seeing evidence of customers
driving greater value from experiential and partner-funded rewards? I guess I'm just wondering if there's a
possibility that pressure on the rewards rate could potentially abate in a sustained way as customers generate
greater value in other ways.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So Christophe can get a little bit more into the detail but I think you hit on a really good point, and one that really is
part of our value proposition, whether it's embedded value that we get from our partners that's embedded in the
value proposition and we're seeing that increase over time, and that's also as you look at refreshes, you see that
within the refreshes, but it's also the Amex offers and how we continue to work with our merchant partners to
provide more benefits to our card members on an ongoing basis, so I think when you take that entire portfolio of
the rewards opportunities that we have, the embedded value that comes within the value proposition and Amex
offers, all of that together and it gets back to what Rick's point was, all of that together leads to more loyalty and
more retention.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And to build that a little bit on the rewards side, we are constantly trying to innovate on the MR side. On the
number of partners engaged in the program, the ease of redemption as well. One of their latest innovation that is
actually very successful in terms of how many card members are using it, is the ability just to select a transaction
on your statement, your digital statement, and actually use MR points to pay for that specific transactions and
we're seeing a lot of card members using that.
So we constantly trying to make it easier and better for our card members to redeem, to make the product the MR
program competitive, and more and more economic as well for us, so it's definitely a place of innovation that is a
very dynamic place.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Yeah, so we are – ICS, and international was the fastest-growing segment of American Express pre-COVID and
has been for several quarters now as well. The opportunity is just much bigger for us in international. We're also
investing, everything else being equal, proportionately a bit more in international. The brand out in international
was probably a bit more premium as well than it is in the US. So there's definitely a massive opportunity for us
and we're going after it, and that's baked in our guidance for this year.
It's also factored in as we think about our long-term aspiration. Part of the things that we're going to do to deliver
on that guidance for this year and the long-term aspiration is actually to grow at a faster pace in international. It's
a great opportunity for us, for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So we're going to talk more about international at Investor Day. We'll have a separate segment on that. But we're
also going to talk about how we continue to grow international coverage. And if you remember, a number of years
ago, we talked about our international city strategy, we talked about industries we're going after, and so we'll
provide some updates on that, but the top line is international acceptance continues to grow and continues to
improve. And when you look at the international business growing at the rate it's growing, and coverage
continuing to grow, we see that as a long runway for future growth.

Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to dig in and ask, can we talk about the

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Yeah. So Pay Over Time is a facility that is available on our charge product. It's a service that a lot of card
members are taking advantage of. It's the opportunity for them to revolve some of their transactions or part of their
balance. Their performance is very strong. It's actually the segment of our balances that is the fastest growing.
And from a – I would say from a performance standpoint, because that product or that service is attached to our
charge card products, so typically, premium card members, the credit performance is also the best that we have
in our lending product. So it's a very efficient way for us to grow balances by extending credit to premium card
members. And the first question, I forgot, was...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Funding mix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Funding and – so the funding mix is still – it's still evolving towards more deposits. And as you know, deposits is,
for us, the most effective and the most economical source of fund. And it's a very stable source of fund as well for
us. I think we are at about 92% of our deposit, direct deposit balances are below the FDIC cap. So it's a stable,
resilient growing source of funding for us. And it's generating a lot of good things for us, including supporting our
growth and growth plan and growth aspiration. And when you look at the yield that I had on the lending slide, one
of the drivers behind the yield expansion year-over-year is actually a more effective cost of fund. And it's not a
one-off, right? That has been a trend for several years now, and there is more to come.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks so much. If you look at your commercial spending, particularly SME growth, it's been particularly
weak the last couple of quarters. And we're noticing on slide 5 the goods and services has basically been flat to
down for a couple of quarters. And you mentioned things that are unique to small business. But maybe, could you
expand that a little more and talk about what things we might see that would cause that to start to turn and how
long you can kind of maintain the kind of teens growth in loans while that is kind of flattish. If you could talk about
those things. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
All right. Let me start, and I'm sure Steve will add on to this. So you're right, I mean, the SME billed business has
been in that 1%, 2% range for a year now. We think that this is macro driven, and we have a ton of data that
confirms that. It's not specific to American Express, and the rest of the industry is experiencing similar trends.
I will note, as I think we said in the prepared remarks, that on the acquisition side, it's going very strongly so the
demand for the product is there. Their quality of the applicant is there as well, and as we've said in the past, I
would say the tenured base that is moderating their spend.
We'll see how it goes. Those card members, the SME as we've said in the past, have been going through a lot.
They're certainly experiencing as well their compound effect of funding cost for several years now, and they're
very careful in terms of how they're managing their cash flows and how they're spending.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
This being said we are very focused at working with them. As I said, engaging with them and we're confident that
we have what it takes to win them back when they are ready to spend more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, I think that, Moshe, when you look at this, the SME has been this entire space has been sort of disrupted
over the last four years or so, maybe five years, with COVID where it took a tremendous drop for 18 months or so,
and then all of a sudden, you had unbelievable, unsustainable organic growth of like 19% and 20% in given years.
It was crazy growth in 2021 and 2022, and we saw last year, after the first quarter, it really started to wane, and
again, I think there's again a few reasons for that.
There's tremendous buildup in inventories, I think interest rates going up, did not help from a small business
perspective, especially as they thought about purchasing goods and services and buying those goods and
services and stocking them in anticipation of another supply chain formality or meltdown, and what we do like is
that our acquisition is still very strong. The transactions, even within the tenured base, continue to go up.
It's the larger transactions that where we're really seeing organic decline on and a lot of that can be industry-
specific, construction. A lot of that can also be not buying big inventories upfront, so I think what's important for us
to focus on right now is to continue to acquire, continue to work with them and engaging with them, and then
when they're ready to come back, we're there for them as they want to spend even more.
As far as, and I started the conversation with this. As far as overall spending, that's what makes me feel really
good about our overall spending, because we're able to grow 7% with our commercial business growing very low
and small business only growing at 1%, and it's an important part of the franchise and that's why we feel good,
because of the credit and of the new acquisition.

So maybe to bring together some of the pieces of revenue growth. I think you were at the high end the first
quarter and I think, Christophe, you said the expectation that NII was going to slow. Maybe just talk a little bit

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
about how you think about the trajectory, the revenue growth. Do we need to see spend stabilize to remain in the
range or can we see the impact of refreshes and card acquisitions be enough to stabilize revenue growth within
the range on a quarterly basis. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So things are, in Q1, played out as we were expecting. We – billed business, came in similar to what we
experienced in the previous quarters. Card fee is moderating slightly from 17% to 16%, FX-adjusted growth rate
and we're still expecting that it will pick-up a little bit in the balance of the year, on the back of the things that you
said including the card refreshes and acquiring a lot of premium cards and NII at 26% is going to keep moderating
but the balances are moderating, so the guidance for the full-year is still to be between 9% and 11%. We'll see
exactly how things play out. There are still a lot of things to find out how the late payment charges are going to
come in, what's going to happen with the interest rates, so best at this stage I think is to stick to the full year
guidance of 9% to 11% and but I would say Q1 validated the trends and the guidance that we gave at the
beginning of the year.
