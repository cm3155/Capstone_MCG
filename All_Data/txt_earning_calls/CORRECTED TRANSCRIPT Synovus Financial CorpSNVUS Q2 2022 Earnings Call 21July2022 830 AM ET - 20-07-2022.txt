Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning. Thank you, Cal, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. We're extremely
proud of the accomplishments and the financial results we'll share this morning. They provide further proof points
into the continued successful execution of our strategic growth plan, while also continuing to demonstrate
prudence as we prepare for the impacts of less certain economic conditions in the coming quarters.
Our path forward was built with potential challenges in mind and a level of flexibility that allows us to adapt quickly
as needed. Knowing that there is greater level of uncertainty ahead, we are balancing our growth objectives with
a keen focus on safety and soundness. But as you'll see today, we're entering these unsettled times in a position
of strength, with a focus on exiting the other side as an even stronger, more agile company.
We produced another strong quarter of loan growth while credit metrics are at historically low levels. Net income
growth this quarter was driven by the expansion of interest income given the growth in loans and efficiently
managing our asset sensitivity with low-deposit betas on the rate hikes to date. As a result of another strong
quarter of performance, we believe we will perform at or above our stated guidance and loan growth and expect
revenue to be considerably above our original expectations for the year.
We are also making significant progress in the new business initiatives and our strategic growth plan, which we
clearly outlined during our first quarter Investor Day presentation. Though it seems like that day was a long time
ago and the environment is changing rapidly, our commitment to execution is as strong as ever, and we feel very
good about the progress we're making.
First, Maast, our banking-as-a-service platform is progressing nicely as we began beta testing with our first
integrated software provider client late in the second quarter. With a pilot solution in place, we can expect to
continue testing and enhancing our functionality and capabilities throughout the rest of the year. We are targeting
four to five additional software providers to pilot the solution by year end with a focus across various B2B
segments.
A broader rollout of the solution is targeted for first quarter 2023 with the $100 million revenue target still
considered to be very achievable based upon the continued feedback and interest we are receiving. Second, the
buildout of our corporate and investment banking team has continued this quarter. The leaders of our FIG and
TMC verticals are in place. And a leader of our healthcare vertical recently accepted our offer to join the team. In
total, we have hired 12 staff members, including credit, product specialists and support personnel.
In the third quarter, we plan to make a broader public announcement of these hires and also expect this team to
begin adding new business to the balance sheet and income statement. In addition to Maast and CIB, we have a
number of initiatives underway aimed at deepening relationships and serving as new sources of growth. In this
vein, I am pleased that we have completed the final migration of our commercial clients to Gateway, our new
commercial digital platform.
We also have continued to add new Treasury & Payment Solutions, international and FX capabilities, card
services and integrated receivables functionality are all being significantly enhanced and we have a roadmap of
new functionality that will complement our already robust set of offerings in the quarters to come. We are also

enhancing our online account origination capabilities and adding analytics to better support our consumer bankers
in proactively addressing the needs of our clients.
Within our Wholesale Banking segment, we continue to be an attractive platform for new middle market bankers.
Over the last two quarters, we have added five new middle market bankers in Florida. And this quarter, we also
added new leadership in the Nashville market.
In addition, we continue to see traction in our restaurant specialty group with $200 million in loan growth this
quarter and our recently built Agent Bank capability generated approximately $2 million in new fee income this
quarter across multiple sub-lines of business. Overall, the momentum in our core businesses is generating growth
and strong financial performance. This success helps to fund and support the ongoing investment in new
business initiatives which will deliver incremental financial benefits in the quarters and years to come.
Let me now transition to financial highlights for the quarter. Total revenue for the second quarter was $523 million,
an increase of 7% year-over-year. When adjusted for PPP fees, total revenue increased 11% year-over-year. The
increase was driven by NII growth, a result of continued strong loan growth, as well as margin expansion resulting
from higher interest rates.
Loans increased $1.2 billion excluding PPP, or 12% on an annualized basis with diversified growth across the
Wholesale, Community and Consumer business lines, evidencing the strong momentum we have across all of our
businesses and client segments. Commercial loans again served as the primary driver of growth as second
quarter funded production was up 41% year-over-year with a 1% increase in line utilization supplementing overall
growth.
While today's economic outlook is trending more negatively, our underlying credit performance, as evidenced by
our credit metrics, continues to trend positively. Our NPA, NPL and criticized and classified ratios represent some
of the lowest levels that we've experienced in some time. The performance of the loan book is largely a function of
better diversification, high underwriting standards and adherence to our disciplined credit framework.
It is also worth noting that at this point, we remain cautiously optimistic on the short-term credit outlook and see
that our clients are carrying unprecedented levels of liquidity into this more challenging economic environment.
Speaking of liquidity, continued balance augmentation, combined with account growth, led to quality non-interest-
bearing deposit growth of $254 million in the second quarter. Over the last three years, we have grown non-
interest-bearing deposits from 25% to 35% of our core deposit base. This ongoing remix will continue to pay
dividends in the coming quarters as rates continue to rise.
Our net interest margin expanded 22 basis points in the second quarter, with increases in short-term interest rates
driving increases in loan yields, while prudent deposit pricing led to lower than expected deposit betas on a cycle-
to-date basis. Our strong second quarter financial performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, return
on average assets of 1.27%, return on tangible common equity of 19%, and an efficiency ratio of 53.4%, serves
as validation that the team's continued strong execution and our success in meeting the needs of our clients is
leading to profitable growth. Overall, we're very pleased with the current results, our continued momentum, and
our ability to focus on our longer-term plans and objectives.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jamie to continue the overview of our quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide 4. Total loan balances ended the second
quarter at $41 billion. Excluding PPP balances, loans grew $1.2 billion. On an annualized basis, this represents a
growth rate of 12%, our fourth consecutive quarter of annualized double-digit loan growth. C&I loans were up
$542 million quarter-over-quarter, and CRE loans grew $358 million. Commercial loan growth was broad-based
as 10 of 11 Wholesale Bank sub-businesses and the Community Bank grew balances in the second quarter.
The diversity of growth continues to be the hallmark of our commercial loan growth story. This diversity brings
consistency to our growth plan and also mitigates credit risk as we head into what could be a challenging
economic environment in the second half of the year. Growth within CRE loans was led by the multifamily sector
as well as our Specialty Healthcare group, which focuses on lending to larger medical practice groups. We also
continue to see growth in commercial production and line utilization.
Commercial production increased 41% year-over-year and line utilization increased to 47.1%, up from 46.1% in
Q1. Higher utilization from lines existing at the end of the first quarter contributed approximately $185 million to
loan growth in the second quarter. As we have previously noted, higher utilization levels are reflective of our
clients' investment spend and inflationary pressures related to higher input and labor cost, among other factors.
Consumer loan balances increased $252 million. This growth was diversified across multiple consumer products,
including mortgage and home equity lending. Third-party consumer loan balances remain flat quarter-over-
quarter. This is reflective of our priority to allocate growth capital first to our core client base, which experienced
robust growth over the quarter. While the residual effects of COVID and the recent tightening of monetary policy
present notable macroeconomic headwinds, we remain confident that our geographic footprint puts us in a
position to perform well relative to the rest of the country, and we remain optimistic about our continued strong
performance over the remainder of 2022.
As we turn to slide 5, we continue to see positive trends within our deposit base, despite industry headwinds and
a more challenging backdrop relative to the record pace we saw in 2020 and 2021. Regardless of the
environment, our focus remains on serving our clients in a way that leverages our platform to deepen
relationships, both with deposits as well as across other financial products. The results of these efforts are evident
as core noninterest-bearing deposits increased $254 million quarter-over-quarter. This marks the 10th
consecutive quarter of consistent NIB growth. At 35% of core deposits, NIB is a meaningful component of our
overall funding strategy and will help manage overall funding costs in a rising rate environment.
Money market balances declined $804 million quarter-over-quarter. In assessing the underlying drivers of the
decline, there were multiple factors, including seasonal tax payments, as well as relatively normal deployment of
liquidity by clients. Additionally, we saw impacts from the interest rate environment where certain higher cost
funds moved out of the banking system and into higher yielding non-bank alternatives. In many instances, we
were able to facilitate the reallocation of client funds and despite losing the deposit, we continue to manage the
clients' assets.
Beyond our core portfolio, we also continue to use the brokered-deposit market as a means to manage our
balance sheet and liquidity position in a cost effective manner relative to other non-core funding sources. Year-to-
date, we have grown brokered deposits by $788 million. Following a $797 million decline in the first quarter,
brokered deposits grew $1.59 billion in the second quarter. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize core
relationship deposit growth while continuing to use brokered deposits as a secondary tool to manage our balance
sheet.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
With regards to deposit rates, our average cost of deposits increased 4 basis points in the second quarter to
0.15%. As expected, the initial hikes in March and May had a modest impact on deposit calls as we were able to
limit rate increases across the majority of our products. However, given the FOMC's most recent 75-basis point
hike in June, as well as expected additional near-term increases, we are seeing some upward pressure on
deposit costs, as would be reasonably expected for this phase of a tightening cycle.
Moving to slide 6, you can see that within June, the average increase in the FOMC's target rate was 113 basis
points from the fourth quarter of 2021. And against that increase, our cycle deposit beta through June on interest-
bearing non-maturity deposits was 12%, and for total deposits, it was 7%. This is lower than the 20% we
previously estimated for interest-bearing non-maturity deposits for the first 100 basis points in short rate
increases. However, we expect much of that variance to be attributable to the timing of repricing, and we still
believe that our mid-30s interest-bearing non-maturity deposit beta is a reasonable estimate for an FOMC policy
rate that is tightening to neutral. This would translate to an approximate 30% beta for total deposits.
With that said, we acknowledge that the FOMC has communicated the prospects for hiking rates beyond a neutral
posture. When coupled with their policy on managing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, this could put upward
pressure on our assumed cyclical beta. In such a scenario, we remain well positioned with an asset sensitive
balance sheet, which can withstand some further pressure on betas and still benefit from increases in the long-
term rates. It is worth noting that approximately two-thirds of our reported asset sensitivity is attributable to short
rates. And as shown previously, a 10% change in beta assumptions would impact our NII sensitivity by
approximately 1.5%.
We believe maintaining an asset sensitive position in the current environment is warranted, particularly given the
uncertainty around Fed policy. As we look forward, the continued growth in floating rate loans, hedging maturities,
as well as fixed rate repricing will support our asset sensitive profile even as marginal betas increase past our
through-the-cycle beta expectations.
Moving to slide 7. The combination of strong loan growth I alluded to previously, coupled with the recent move
higher in interest rates, served to support significant growth in net interest income in the second quarter, which
came in at $425 million, an increase of $44 million or 11% year-over-year.
When adjusted for the headwinds from slower PPP fee accretion, that represents an additional $60 million or a
17% increase versus the like quarter one year ago. I would note that with less than $100 million in PPP loan
balances and approximately $3 million in unearned fees outstanding as of quarter end, the NII and NIM impact
from PPP should be relatively immaterial going forward.
The net interest margin was 3.22% in the second quarter, an increase of 22 basis points from the first quarter. As
shown in the NIM waterfall, the impact of higher short-term rates helped to support loan yields with some offset
through higher costs on interest-bearing deposits. The combination of these two factors supported the margin by
approximately 13 basis points and was the primary driver of NIM expansion in the second quarter.
Additionally, the impact of higher long-term rates and our continued efforts to efficiently manage our liquidity
position supported the margin in the quarter with the latter contributing approximately 5 basis points to the margin
through a quarterly reduction in average cash balances.
Looking ahead, while the pace of FOMC rate increases and the timing of deposit repricing makes quarterly NIM
guidance challenging, we continue to expect further expansion in the coming quarters. The wider margin is

expected to be driven by the benefits of higher short-term rates, which are realized fairly quickly and the benefits
of higher long-term rates where fixed rate repricing serves to gradually support the net interest margin.
Slide 8 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $101 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter and
down $5 million year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decline is primarily related to a decline in mortgage
revenue, lower SBA income and a write-down of a minority FinTech investment. Offsetting these declines was an
increase in wealth revenue, card fees and capital markets income. As you can see on the slide, these same
categories also grew year-over-year and are a key indicator of growth within our core client base.
Wealth revenue grew year-over-year despite headwinds from a decline in the equity markets of 11%. This
highlights the diversity of the revenue streams within our wealth segment in areas such as trust and family office
which continue to grow client count. Overall, approximately 40% of wealth revenues are not directly impacted by
changes in market valuation.
Core banking fees continue to benefit from card fees, which increased 21% year-over-year, a result of account
growth as well as higher levels of both consumer and commercial spend activity. And on the capital markets side,
in Q2, we saw broad-based contribution within our Wholesale Bank as multiple sub-business lines generated
Agent Bank fees.
Moving on to expenses, slide 9 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $284 million, up $4 million from
the prior quarter and up $15 million year-over-year, which represents a 6% increase. Employment expense
increased only 3% year-over-year primarily attributable to the impacts of merit and elevated performance
incentives. As a result of Synovus forward initiatives, we have been able to hold the overall head count flat year-
over-year while adding head count in areas associated with strategic revenue growth.
On that note, when segmenting our year-over-year increase in expenses, approximately 60% is attributable to
performance-related costs and investments in new business initiatives covered at investor day such as CIB,
Maast and the build-out of our middle market banking segment. As we look over the remainder of the year, we
expect expenses associated with these new initiatives, as well as other technology and operations related costs
to increase. Overall, increases in our expense base are oriented towards performance and growth, which we
believe will reward shareholders over time.
Moving to slide 10 on credit quality. Our credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations remain
strong. Key credit ratios remain stable to improving overall and at historically low levels. The NPA and NPL ratios
declined to 0.33% and 0.26% respectively, the lowest we have seen in over 20 years. Total past dues remained
low at 0.14% and the criticized and classified percentage of loans decreased to 2.2%. The net charge-off ratio
was 0.16% for the quarter.
In the second quarter, our ACL was $458 million or 1.11% of loans. Despite our continued elevated weightings to
adverse scenarios, the ACL declined $4 million quarter-on-quarter. This was largely a result of the strong credit
performance, including the decline in NPL. Our credit and relationship management teams remain diligent in
monitoring our loan portfolio through portfolio reviews and the use of early warning indicators such as our
analytical risk management tool. These support proactive engagement with clients.
We see that our clients are well positioned for volatility with significant levels of liquidity and a resiliency that has
been tested most recently during the pandemic. The vast majority of our relationships are with long-tenured
counterparties who understand how to navigate the current environment. We are also being judicious in approving
new credit risk we take on our balance sheet.

Our loan portfolio has been built to better weather a downturn with greater diversification across industries, asset
classes, geographies, and credit metrics that support the strength of the borrowers as well as the collateral held.
On the Consumer side, our loan portfolio has an average FICO score of 774, and we expect prime borrowers to
be resilient through a downturn.
Our CRE portfolio has been constructed in a manner that is weighted towards sectors with a positive outlook,
such as multifamily, warehouse, and medical offices. Rent growth and occupancy metrics in our footprint
outperformed the nation and we feel confident that will continue to be the case. Strong demand has allowed our
clients to partially offset the impacts of inflationary pressures. We are actively engaged with these clients so that
we can react to any changes related to the current economic environment.
As noted on slide 11, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.46%. During the second
quarter, we repurchased a modest $3 million in shares as organic capital creation was used primarily to support
client loan growth. Our capital position remained strong and we continue to actively manage CET1 within our
9.25% to 9.75% target range. Going forward, our commitment remains to allocate internally generated capital
toward our strategic priority of client loan growth, while also maintaining a strong and efficient capital position.
Based on our current forecasts for client loan growth and given the uncertain economic environment, we will
retain the capital generated through earnings rather than repurchase shares through the remainder of 2022.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin.

Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. There are a lot of moving pieces, but due to the hard work of so many team members, this is
another very successful quarter. Our engaged team members focused on meeting the needs of our loyal client
base, helped to deliver profitable growth. Helping our clients to reach their full potential is our stated purpose and
I'm so proud of how we are living up to that promise on a daily basis.
Reflecting back on our financial performance, we remain on track to deliver our previously communicated $175
million of pre-tax Synovus forward benefits by the end of this year. Many of the benefits in 2022 have been
revenue focused, but one large expense initiative within the program was the closing of approximately 15% of our
branch network. In Q2, we closed 11 branches, bringing our 2022 total to 20 locations. We expect to close a
similar amount in the second half of the year to complete the large scale branch optimization program.
As a result of our strong loan growth of 6% through the second quarter excluding PPP loans, we expect to be at
or above the upper end of our previous guidance of 6% to 8% for the full year despite the uncertainty in the
economic outlook. As a result of strong loan growth and the current forward rate environment in which Fed funds
reaches a target rate of approximately 3% by the end of the year, total revenue growth excluding PPP revenue is
forecasted to be considerably above the upper end of our communicated range of 9% to 11%.
And on the expense side, we are currently forecasting to be at or slightly above the upper end of our 3% to 6%
expense guidance largely as a result of our strong performance and targeted-strategic business investments. Our
employee incentive structures are tightly aligned with overall performance, and as such, the strong forecasted
revenue performance this year has resulted in higher incentive expectations.

Also, as we shared earlier, our investments in our new business initiatives will accelerate throughout the
remainder of 2022, which puts us in a great position to begin to generate incremental revenue in the quarter and
years to come.
Given the strong positive operating leverage and considering all of the updates to our full-year guidance, our
expectations for the year-over-year PPNR growth has now increased to the mid-20% range, excluding PPP
income. I am pleased with the progress we continue to make as an organization and remain confident in our
ability to deliver sustainable top-quartile performance.
The effects of the current inflationary environment are impacting our team members, clients and more broadly, the
communities we serve. However, we continue to rise to the occasion to provide a source of confidence and trust
in a period of uncertainty. I want to thank again our 5,000-plus team members. You are the secret to our success
and your efforts and contributions are not going unnoticed by our leaders, our clients and our key stakeholders.

I guess, maybe just starting with a bigger picture question. You know, you reference the uncertainty of an
economic slowdown, but your loan growth is great. Your deposit growth is great. Your credit is really good. How
do you think an economic slowdown would actually impact your business? Is that there's more variability on loan
growth and that the utilization rates may come down or there's a bigger question around maybe credit cost as this
flows through? I mean, because right now, things seem pretty good.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
You know, Jared, this is Kevin. Very good question. You nailed I think where I would start is. The biggest
uncertainty going forward will be just on client demand. And we shared in the prepared remarks that we believe,
given our strong growth year-to-date, that we would be at or above the upper end of our loan range for the year.
And the real question there is, will there be economic slowdowns that results in a slower demand for lending. I
think as we've proven out, our productivity continues to increase. And this quarter, I would tell you our loan growth
was probably more diversified than we've had it even in the previous three quarters. So, we remain very confident
in our ability to generate loans, but the demand side of that will drive the ultimate growth story there.
The other areas I would point to, you mentioned credit cost. Obviously, we pointed to the fact that we've had
some of the best credit metrics we've had in some time. So, in the short run, we don't see accelerated credit cost.
But as you noted, that could change given the environment.
And third, I would point to a couple of the NIR categories whether it's wealth and just looking at equity markets
and the pressure we get with assets under management there and just looking at overall core client fees that as
people spend less, i.e., on the credit card side, we could see some headwinds on the interchange piece. So,
there's lots of variables and lots of impacts to different revenue items. But as we sit here today, we remain
consciously optimistic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. That's great color. And I guess just a follow-up, more specifically on commercial real estate. As we
went into the end of the quarter and after the last Fed move, have you seen any noticeable impact on demand or
on the impact of cap rates on customer demand for new CRE loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, no. We had a really strong production this quarter in CRE. We actually – our funded production was up
about 100% over where it was in the previous quarter, and that was primarily in two categories, multifamily and
medical office. So, where we've continued to grow is in some of our specialty areas. It's not across all of the asset
classes.
We've actually seen slightly elevated payoff activity continuing. We're still about $200 million to $300 million over
what we would consider the three-year payoff average, but demand is still there. I think as cap rates start to
increase, we expect to see payoffs and pay-downs subside a bit just because that churn was elevated over the
last couple of years just with developers taking money off the table. But productivity has been very high. Bob,
anything you'd add on your side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Jared. Hi. This is Bob. We clearly are beginning to see some slowing of demand as the economics of
these projects are harder to make work, given the higher input cost, labor cost, et cetera. So, we would expect
that to have a headwind to real estate growth. As Kevin mentioned, the payoffs have abated a little bit, but there's
still ample capital out there to pay us off once these loans get stabilized.
So, all-in-all, I think it will slow. But I do think commercial real estate from a credit perspective has performed well.
Our leverage attach points here are really good. Loan-to-values, loan-to-costs are really good, and we're dealing

with a good group of clients we've banked for a long time. So, we still feel good about the credit quality, but the
velocity of growth should temper certainly over time as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hi, Jared. This is Jamie. Let me add one more thing to this. You mentioned the credit cost and a slower growth
environment. In the appendix, we put our weightings to scenarios for our allowance calculation. And in there, you
can see that one of the scenarios is a slow growth scenario. So to give you a little bit of context, that slow growth
scenario has approximately 1.6% annualized GDP for the next four years, has unemployment rising above 5%.
And as you're aware, we use a multi-scenario framework. But if we only used a single scenario and if that slow
growth scenario was the single scenario kind of like what you described in your question, our allowance would be
very similar to where it is today.

Just on the topic of growing net interest income, so are we kind of in a situation where it's going to be the
percentage margin growing it? You were clear that you expect that to continue to expand. But I'm interested what
you think about average earning assets of the average balance sheet. Will that be flattish? In other words, will you
– its loan growth stays where it is or slows a bit and we see deposits continue to decline. Will you continue to step
in with the brokered to keep that balance sheet growing or you're confident enough in the margin that you can just
keep that flat or slightly up and still grow net interest income in the balance of the year? Thanks.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Kevin. Yeah. Got it. As we look forward, there are a few questions embedded in that. And as we look at the
balance sheet, you should expect to see the balance sheet grow similar to the rate of growth of the loan book.
And that's what you saw in the second quarter. That's what you should see in the future.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
The funding choice we make on that is purely economical, and so there are plenty of alternatives. As you're
aware, we have a lot of liquidity options over – we have over 20% of total assets available to us when you add up
cash on balance sheet, home loan bank advances, and unencumbered securities. And obviously, we have
deposit avenues as well that we can grow. So, you should expect to see the balance sheet grow at the rate of
growth of the loan portfolio.
With regards to NII, it's a very interesting time period for NII and the outlook for NII going forward, because the
pace of Fed rate increases is quick enough that it is going up faster than the rate of pace of deposit cost
increases. There's a timing lag between the two. And so, that timing lag is highly accretive to NII to the point that
when we look at the third quarter NII, we would expect to see NII growth somewhere between 9% to 10% in the
third quarter based on the timing lag continuing and the market outlook for rate increases from the Fed here in the
third quarter.
That being said, that rate of growth – that's not a sustainable rate of growth beyond that, because you have two
things happening. One, that timing lag does not benefit you forever. As a matter of fact, when the Fed stops
raising interest rates, it'll be a short-term headwind. But our expectation is once you get beyond that and
excluding that impact of the headwind of timing lags when the Fed is down with this tightening cycle, we would
expect to see NII grow at the rate of loan growth plus a little bit because of the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Great. Thanks, Jamie. One quick follow-up. Kevin, this is more of a big picture question like we've
mentioned. We've been through a lot of detail on the growth initiatives and you guys made clear that the
expenses are going up for that in the back half of the year, but we also talked about the uncertain environment.
And I'm just curious, was there any contemplation about delaying or slowing those growth initiatives and that
spending for when the environment gets a little more certain or were these things really locked in and there was
no way to consider doing that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Kevin. When you think about what we're spending, it really gets bucketed in a couple of different
categories. First Maast, and we believe that being a first mover in our banking-as-a-service platform is going to be
very important. And quite frankly, opening up that channel to small businesses as we look towards the future
environment's going to be very important. So – although we could have slowed it, we just didn't feel like that was
prudent. And we're continuing to move forward with our beta product and we'll again roll it out next year and the
full product in 2023.
When you think about corporate and investment banking, that's another area where I believe right now is an
opportunity to not only gain talent from some of these larger institutions but you've seen from some of the larger
peers this earnings cycle that a lot of growth on the balance sheet has come out of the capital markets and back
on to commercial banking balance sheet, and that's one of the areas we think we can play in the space. Whether
it's in the FIG, TMC or Healthcare space, we feel like we can play in that lower market CIB area where the clients
need to use the customer's balance sheets. And so, we decided to again accelerate that initiative.
The others, when you look at this expense, it's really around Treasury products and it's around analytics. And I
just think that if you're not investing in new solutions and products and you're not investing in data and analytics,
you're going to get behind your competition.

So in reality, we've had discussions around expense management, but I just think it makes a lot of sense given
the returns on investment on these projects. We looked at this full year and if you think about those investments,
they represent about 2% of our expense growth. So when you think about the 6% we're up, they represent about
2%. But I look out into 2023 and see that those same investments are going to represent 2% to 3% of our PPNR.
And you look out into 2024, they're going to represent 6% to 10% of our PPNR. So, we feel very convicted to
continue to invest there and we've seen success in not only the talent front but also on mass and building out the
product.

Good morning, Brady.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So I just wanted to ask a question on capital or balance sheet optimization. I heard Jamie said no more buybacks,
which totally makes sense given those growth. But, I mean, if you look at common equity Tier 1, you're kind of
right in the middle of your range, you're seeing good growth opportunity. Is there anything to consider on the
balance sheet optimization side that could give you a little more room to continue booking this robust growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You know, it's a great question, Brady. You're right. For the remainder of 2022, we expect to retain capital
generated through earnings. Thus we believe that there are opportunities on balance sheet to serve our clients.
We see the uncertainty in the economic outlook. And so, we think that's the prudent thing to do.
13


Synovus Financial Corp.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
But you're right that there could be opportunities on the balance sheet for balance sheet optimization and you're
well aware of our third-party portfolio, how we think about that as a surrogate for the securities portfolio. And so, if
the right opportunity came up there, our priority would be to deploy that part of our balance sheet to our clients.
And so, that portfolio is one that we consider as a tool we can use to manage in the environment we have. No
updates on that today, but that is how we look at it and there are possibilities that we use that portfolio as a
surrogate for the CRE's book and can look at deploying that capital to our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, Jamie, you think by utilizing the retained earnings, optimizing the balance sheet, you can kind of self-fund this
growth that there would be no need to raise any sort of additional debt or preferred or anything to support the
growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, on the capital side, we do believe that our earnings will generate more than enough capital to support our
client growth. As you heard, our outlook on client growth, getting to the high end of our range at or above the high
end of our range of 6% to 8%, organic earnings should be plenty to cover the capital of that loan growth and build
capital truthfully.
When you think about debt, that's a different story. And it's liquidity, both at the holdco and at the bank. And we
just manage that, the same way we always have. And we will continue to look at holdco liquidity and bank liquidity
and make sure that we are well within our coverage ratios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. And then finally for me, yeah, the reserves down to 1.1%. You guys are seeing good growth but it feels like
the provision has to go higher. It's not a bad thing, it's growth related, but it feels like the provision should be going
higher here, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look forward with the allowance, we would expect it to grow, commensurate with loan growth. I mean – and
you know that our growth if you look at the marginal growth that we're putting on balance sheet, it is lower risk
than the average of our balance sheet. And so it's a positive or actually will reduce the allowance to loan ratio, all
things constant. But you're right to expect that the allowance will grow with loan growth, assuming the economy
and the economic outlook doesn't change. And you do see our weightings to these adverse scenarios remains
elevated given the economic uncertainty.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, just wanted to follow-up on deposits and liquidity, Jamie. I mean, one, just talk to us – so you talked
about mid-30s deposit beta for non-maturity and then 30 basis points for total deposits, which I assume includes
CDs and NIB. So, is your sense that if the Fed stops – and you mentioned something about neutral versus above
neutral, just trying to make sure we get the right message. If the Fed stops hiking at somewhere around 3.5%,
would that be neutral? And in that, well, do you expect total deposit beta to be in the mid-30s or would you expect
that to be higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, when we think about neutral, we are defining that – if you look at the Fed dot plot looking at the long-
term expectations for Fed funds rate, which is in the low 2s. If you were to assume that the Fed tightens to the low
to mid 3s, it would add approximately 5% to 10% through the cycle beta that we laid out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Understood. So all right. So, if the Fed actually goes as the forward curve is implying right now, maybe closer to
40% total deposit beta. And just tied to that, it sounds like you're going to grow the loans and the balance sheet.
Pre-pandemic, the loan to deposit ratio was closer to in the 95%-100% range, do we see it going there? And
what's the outlook on third-party loans? Does that portfolio shrink from here or do you expect to continue to buy
into that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We do expect to see the loan to deposit ratio increase. However, we believe that's more of an output of balance
sheet strategy than a target or an expectation, and we'll continue to use the various sources of liquidity as we see
the value. And so, we compare brokered deposits, we compare home loan bank advances as we think about how
to fund incremental growth beyond core client deposit growth. And so, that's really how we think about it.
When we look forward in 2022, we do believe that core client deposits will grow. We believe that we'll see 1% to
2% client deposit growth in the second half of the year. And if you think about loan growth, that is approximately
what we have to get to the 8% high end of the range on guidance. And so, that's our current outlook. There's a lot
15


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
of uncertainty in 2022 in the second half of the year on that. You saw the flows in the second quarter. And so,
that's our expectation here in the near term.
With regards to the third-party portfolio, that portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, is basically a surrogate for the
investment portfolio, but one difference is, is that we do have some flow arrangements and we have partnerships
embedded in there that are not things you just turn on and turn off. And so, those continue. We're really pleased
with those partnerships. We believe those are accretive to the shareholder through the cycle. And so, we feel
really good about those.
But there are also portfolios that we purchase. You're aware of the auto portfolio that we purchased. We liked that
profile because of a couple of things. One, it's up in credit; two, the collateral values are strong; and three, it has a
shorter duration profile. And so, what we like about it is that it amortized as quickly. And so, that portfolio is
expected to amortize down approximately 40% in a given year. And so, that's not something we would look to
replace in this environment of uncertainty. And so that's our philosophy at the moment. I would say that the floor
arrangements are our core partnerships that we have and then any portfolio purchases are really similar to
securities portfolio and kind of more non-core.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And hey, Ebrahim, can I just add one thing back on the deposit side? Jamie is 100% right. But when we talk about
building an elevated growth profile, it isn't just on the lending side. We're focused on building an elevated growth
profile on the liquidity side as well. And so if you think about some of our core businesses where we're growing
today in commercial, we have an equal focus on generating operating deposit accounts. And you saw this
quarter, another quarter of strong DDA growth.
You look at overall production for deposits, this past quarter we were up 30% over the first quarter, and so we are
focused on generating new deposit relationships. We also have businesses that we think over time are going to
help supplement that growth. Maast will be a good deposit generator for us. We have a money service business
that we've just launched on the Treasury side that we think will provide good core deposits.
And so when we talk about growth, it's about balance growth. It's growing the asset side and the liability side. And
over time, we think that the growth from the new clients will get in these businesses will help to feed some of the
low-cost deposit growth that we'll need to be able to fund it.

Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Kevin, maybe just a bigger picture question. I appreciate all the near-term guidance. It sounds like everything is
going better than you initially expected. The longer-term piece is that you laid out back in February, although
seemingly a short time ago, a lot has happened. If you had to kind of pick areas of that, maybe where you're most
concerned, or on the flip side, areas where you think you might get there more quickly, it seems rates are going to
be higher than you initially thought. Maybe the market has some concern over growth. Obviously, you've got a lot
of initiatives going, but just kind of curious if you could hit those targets maybe more quickly than you originally
thought or just kind of your thinking around those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brad. The real wild card there is just what would happen from an economic standpoint. And although the
rates are providing a strong tailwind, will we see certain headwinds from slower economic growth that would slow
our growth in certain areas? As it relates to our core businesses, we always talk about the new business
initiatives, but our core businesses are performing at a very high level. When you look at just loan growth this
quarter, we had 13% growth in CRE, 11% growth in C&I, and 12% growth in Consumer. And so, very balanced
growth across all of our segments across our lines of business. And so, that gives me a lot of confidence that the
core businesses will continue to perform that allow us to fund some of these new initiatives.
The new initiatives, we said that we would have a product available to test in Maast by the end of the second
quarter. We are testing an MVP product with a service provider or a software provider. We're excited to get
feedback from that beta testing. As we said, we'll add four to five new ISPs this year to be able to continue to test
it. And we're actually accelerating some work on Maast to add new functionality and capabilities outside of the
payments and depository products that were going to be some of the first that we rolled out. So, we actually could
accelerate that and add new functionality.
On CIB, I feel like the talent that Tom Dierdorff has been able to bring in, in a short period of time has been
extraordinary. I'm excited to have those guys in their seats in the third quarter. And I think you'll start to see that
we're starting to book some business there. We actually feel that our long-term targets in CIB, based on the talent
we're bringing in, we actually will be able to accelerate when we achieve some of those balance sheet targets and
PPNR targets.
So, in general, I would say that we are as optimistic today as we were back in February. The only challenge for us
is just understanding what credit cost or what client demand would be through whatever this economic downturn
is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thanks, Kevin. And maybe just as a follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping questions for Jamie. One, I
was curious if you had maybe the net interest margin for the month of June. And then secondly, within fees, I
17


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
know other fees can bounce around, a lot falls in that category, only $2 million this quarter. I know there was a $7
million investment write-down. But I'm just kind of curious, anything else that might have fallen in that line item
that might bounce back for you over the near term? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brad, the margin for the month of June was materially higher than in the quarter. But before kind of getting
into that, I just want to caveat that it benefits from the timing lag I described earlier. So, I don't want to read too
much into a one-month margin because there are the benefits of deposit pricing being slower than loan repricing.
For the month of June, the margin was 3.35% and just with the caveats that I just described.
On fee revenue, you're right, we had the $7 million write-down of the investment, which is largely due to market
valuation swings in Software-as-a-Service companies. But there's really not a whole lot in fee revenue that I would
point to that's more idiosyncratic to the quarter.
I would say, as you can see on the slide, we've laid out our core kind of client fee growth excluding mortgage,
which we believe is a very important part of the story, up $10 million year-over-year. And then within mortgage,
we do feel good about the growth there. Production remains strong in mortgage, and we believe that we could
see some bounce back there from the $4 million in the second quarter.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Your loan growth was really strong in the second quarter and for the last few quarters.
Just wondering what the pipeline looks like right now, and could it be double digits for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jennifer, the pipelines remain strong. They're down a little bit from where we were entering the second
quarter, but not by a material amount. So, we are remaining optimistic on the third quarter production. Could they
end in double digits? I mean, it's potentially they could given that we've grown each quarter by roughly 3%. I think
the wild card there is just the uncertainty in the environment and what will happen with client loan demand.
Bob mentioned earlier in their credit meetings, they're starting to see some slowing in just CRE activity. But we
remain fairly optimistic for the reasons I mentioned earlier. When you look at this quarter, we had very diversified
loan growth in growing our three main asset classes. When you break it down on the C&I side, we had 14 mixed
codes that had growth and 5 categories that had over $50 million of growth. When you look at it by market of our
47 markets we serve, 65% of those markets had growth this quarter.
So for me, what gives me optimism in being able to continue to grow the book is just the level of diversification
and the fact that we're getting it from so many different asset classes and so many different businesses and
18

geographies that I think you'll continue to see it, being able to call what the ultimate growth for the year is, is just
so hard not knowing what's going to happen from an economic headwind perspective. But I don't want you to
interpret our message today that we've seen a major shift in the customer sentiment for loans, but we do know
that there's some uncertainty that's in the future.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just as we're thinking, kind of, longer term, just going
back to Investor Day which seems like eons ago at this point. I remember the day of Investment Day or Investor
Day, the targets that you guys laid out were essentially in line with where consensus was at the time, but with
those where consensus is now is kind of come in versus where those targets are. And I know you guys are
committed to kind of top-quartile performance. But I guess as we – if you were to do the Investor Day today,
maybe if you could answer for us both strategically and from a target point of view, what you would potentially
change? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
I'll start strategically and I'll ask Jamie to add on any targets. But Michael, as I said earlier, I'm not sure we would
change anything within our strategy. I actually felt like our plan was built with some level of uncertainty and the
ability to make modifications along that three-year journey.
And so, the investments that we're making today, I think we're doubling down on those investments in an
interesting way going into an economic downturn. I think that's the time you really do invest. And it gives you an
opportunity to come out of the other side of whatever this downturn is, a stronger, more diversified, more agile
company.
So, on the strategic side, I don't think there's anything we would change. When you think about the targets and
you said this. And I'll let Jamie provide any absolute points that he wants to make, but the important part there is
we gave you some numbers based on those forward curves and based on those forecast. But the important part
is to know that what we committed to was top-quartile growth.
So, regardless of what the absolute numbers are in those categories, we want to make sure we're in the upper
25% of our peer group in those metrics. And I think whether it's in a prolonged economic downturn or whether this
is a short, shallow recession that recovers quickly and we're back to high levels of growth, whatever those
absolute numbers end up being, we want to make sure that relatively speaking we're in the top 25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Really not too much to add from my perspective. Obviously, the interest rate environment or outlook
currently is higher, which will be supportive to interest income. So, I would expect to see higher returns and then I
19


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
would also expect to see higher return on equity when you think about both the higher top line, as well as the
impact to tangible common equity where we are today.
And so, to Kevin's point, we're focused on top-quartile performance. We believe in our growth initiatives. We
believe that the decisions we are making today in this uncertain environment will position us for shareholder value
over the long term. And so, we're moving forward with our plan.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Kevin and Jamie, I had a question on credit as it pertains to C&I book and as we play
through the cycle with the 25 basis points or so charge offs this quarter. Is that emblematic of what we should
expect over time? I know the book is a lot different than it was in past cycle. So, I just kind of want to relate that to
how that could play out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Chris, this is Bob. Just a comment or two on that. I appreciate the question. Yeah, I think charge-offs in
general and this is certainly true for the C&I book as well. We're kind of range bound right now in the short run. I
mean, all of our early warning indicators are still green, past dues are low, NPLs are low, as Jamie spoke of down
to historically low levels almost.
So, specific to C&I book. I think we're kind of in that range. We don't see anything specific that causes us concern
right now from that perspective. Remember, we do have a third-party book that kind of gives us some quarterly
charge-offs. And then we have a small business book that we're following closely that hasn't seen really any
deterioration, but certainly was a benefactor of PPP loans and as that pulls back and liquidity pulls back, inflation
pressures hit. We would expect some there but quite frankly our pass-through levels and new non-accruals just
continue to be solid. And we're having to, kind of, counter that, if you will, with a heavier downward bias on our
scenarios.

And I would just add to that, Chris, the charge-offs. Any particular quarter, you can see in any of these asset
classes some spikes. But Bob and I were talking, the level of inflows that we're seeing from an NPL's perspective
are at some of the lowest levels. So, although you may see a 24-basis point charge-off in C&I one quarter, but in

general, what we see from an inflow perspective has been very low. So, we would expect there, as we said
earlier, on the short term, we're cautiously optimistic on the credit profile.

Great. That's helpful. And then I guess as utilization continues to ramp up, does that sort of bump up the reserve
allocation there just somewhat over time?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It does. And you saw that in the second quarter. The utilization impact on the allowance was $3 million increase in
the second quarter.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Right. Thank you, Bailey. As we close out today's call, I want to again thank you for your attendance. Our goal as
a leadership team is to continue to be extremely transparent around our actions as well as our objectives and our
results. I believe our growth story is becoming more clear each quarter despite the changes in the economic
environment.
I want to thank our Wholesale, our Community, Treasury & Payment Solutions, FMS, and Consumer line of
business teams. Your execution and your expertise are leading to growth in loans, operating deposits, and fee
income across our markets and our client segments. And none of that growth would be possible without the
support of all of our corporate service team members across our bank. Our success is because of the whole
team, we win together as one Synovus.
Now, today's presentation and the Q&A portion focused a lot on the granular aspects of our business and the
financials, whether it's NIM, betas, allowance or run rates. As passionate as we are to provide the detail and
answers to those questions, we are even more passionate about wowing our clients and growing the company
with a laser focus on execution and investments that drive long-term shareholder value.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Innovation is becoming an even more central part of our strategy as we expand our solutions and the services we
offer. We were recently recognized by the Technology Association of Georgia as a top 40 innovative technology
company. TAG named Synovus as one of Georgia's 10 most innovative companies. As the only financial
institution included on that top 40 list, this award speaks volumes about our team's strategic efforts to build the
bank of the future and to stand out as an innovator in the competitive landscapes of banking, finance and
technology.
Finally, I'm proud of our continued investments in our communities, including our recent contribution to Junior
Achievement from our Here Matters Community Fund. This partnership with JA will bring relevant hands on
financial education and career programming to more than 2,000 Title I students across the five-state footprint. I
can't think of a better way to leverage our time and resources to make a difference by investing in our youth and
helping to reduce income inequality.
Again, thank you for your continued interest and your confidence in our company. We look forward to navigating
with you through the challenges ahead while also continuing to deliver strong performance for our clients, our
team members and our shareholders.
With that, Bailey, we'll close today's call.
