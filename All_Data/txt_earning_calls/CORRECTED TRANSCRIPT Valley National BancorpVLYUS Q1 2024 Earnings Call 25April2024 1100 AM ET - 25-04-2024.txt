Good morning and welcome to Valley's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Presenting on behalf of Valley
today are CEO, Ira Robbins; President, Tom Iadanza; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Hagedorn.
Before we begin, I would like to make everyone aware that our quarterly earnings release and supporting
documents can be found on our company website at valley.com. When discussing our results, we refer to non-
GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today's earnings release for
reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
Additionally, I would like to highlight slide 2 of our earnings presentation and remind you that comments made
during this call may contain forward-looking statements relating to Valley National Bancorp and the banking
industry. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-Q
and 10-K for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results
to differ from those statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

Thank you, Travis. During the first quarter of 2024, Valley reported net income of $96 million and earnings per
share of $0.18. Exclusive of non-core items, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were $99
million and $0.19, respectively. The quarter's results were impacted by an outsized provision for loan losses,
which I will discuss shortly.
On a pre-tax pre-provision basis, we saw a positive inflection this quarter. The sequential downward trend in net
interest income slowed meaningfully despite the lower day count during the quarter. This reflects the benefit of
asset pricing and our efforts to better control funding costs. Fee income results were strong, supported by certain
unique businesses, including tax credit advisory.
Finally, non-interest expenses were extremely well controlled despite the seasonal headwind associated with
higher payroll taxes. Despite the continuation of the inverted yield curve and other environmental challenges, I am
pleased with the stronger pre-tax pre-provision earnings results this quarter. I'm also pleased with the quarter's
balance sheet strength and credit quality performance.
On slide 4, we outlined certain efforts made to curtail loan growth, enhanced reserve coverage where needed in
the portfolio and incrementally optimize our funding base. Total loans declined nearly $300 million during the

quarter as a result of our proactive efforts to participate out a portion of certain commercial real estate and
construction loans and the sale of our commercial premium finance business. These sale transactions each
occurred at or above par and incrementally benefit our commercial real estate concentration, capital ratios and
reserve levels.
Our allowance for credit losses for loans as a percentage of total loans increased 5 basis points to 0.98% during
the quarter. Meanwhile, our past due and non-accrual loans both declined as compared to December 31, 2023.
The higher provision and associated reserve coverage reflects internal risk rating migrations, resulting from our
continuous monitoring and rigor stress testing of the commercial loan portfolio.
During the quarter, an additional 1% of loans transitioned into either our criticized or classified loan buckets. While
we remain comfortable with the sponsorship, collateral, support and potential loss content of these loans,
criticized loans require elevated reserve coverage under CECL. We are comfortable with the current reserve
coverage levels, but anticipate that the allowance could trend slightly higher over the next few quarters.
Our focus on and expertise in commercial real estate lending has generated strong and stable risk-adjusted
financial results throughout our history. The strength of our commercial real estate underwriting and the
consistently industry-leading loss content of our portfolio has contributed to significant shareholder value creation
through above average tangible book value growth.
Our strong network of borrowers have banked with Valley for decades and have performed very well in other
periods of rising interest rates. We remain very confident with our capital allocation and in future credit
performance of our commercial real estate portfolio.
That said, I acknowledge that our perceived concentration in commercial real estate has recently amplified the
volatility in our company's valuation. This volatility is based purely on perception and is not reflective of our
financial results nor the strength of our credit quality and balance sheet. Still, we exist to serve our key
stakeholders. And while I'm proud of our ability to exceed the expectations of our clients, communities and
employees, I acknowledge that the volatility experienced by our shareholders is not sustainable.
Commercial real estate is a wonderful asset class and one in which our differentiated approach continues to
create incredible value. We will remain active in this space, but we'll manage our concentration more efficiently
going forward.
Our diversifying C&I initiatives will continue to accelerate and we will further enhance our financial flexibility.
These efforts are consistent with our established strategic plan, and I believe that accelerating them will help to
reduce the volatility in our valuation.
With this in mind, you can see our near and intermediate-term expectations for certain balance sheet metrics on
slide 5. We expect to have approximately 9.8% Tier 1 common equity, 440% commercial real estate or risk-based
capital, an allowance coverage ratio above 1% and a loan-to-deposit ratio around 100% by year-end 2024. These
metrics are consistent with the strategy, which we have discussed previously, and our ongoing efforts to further
strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility.
The following slide updates our previously provided guidance. The downward revision to our net interest income
forecast reflects slower loan growth and a modest funding mix shift related to lower non-interest bearing deposit
balances during the first quarter. We anticipate that the downward revision in net interest income for the year will
4

be largely offset by lower non-interest expenses relative to our prior guidance. All else equal, this will lead pre-tax
pre-provision income relatively in line with current consensus expectations.
On slide 7, we provide additional commentary on our base case net interest income scenario as well as some
considerations related to our exposure to changing interest rates. As we have described before, our balance
sheet is generally neutral to changes in short-term interest rates. We are more sensitive to movement in longer-
end rates, which impacted repricing of roughly 60% of our loans.
Before turning the call to Tom, I wanted to highlight the underlying franchise value that we continue to create
despite the volatility in our valuation. Since the end of 2017, we have grown reported tangible book value by 47%
versus just 38% for our regional banking peers. Including the impact of distributed dividends, this increases to
91% versus just 70%, respectively. This positive variance reflects our ability to enhance our franchise without
meaningfully diluting tangible book value and overpriced acquisitions or through other efforts to maximize near-
term results.
Customer account growth is another key metric that gauges our ability to build and optimize our franchise. Since
year-end 2017, we have more than doubled our number of commercial deposit accounts, which is in direct
alignment with our strategic objectives. The ongoing addition of new deposit clients is critical as it supports our
future earnings potential and financial consistency. This growth has been broad-based across geographies and
business lines, and we continue to work hard at sustaining this momentum.
We also believe there is significant value in the geographic diversity that we have developed on both the asset
and liability sides of the balance sheet. At the end of 2017, nearly 80% of our commercial loans were
concentrated in New York and New Jersey. That figure has declined to nearly 50% today as a result of our focus
in Florida and other dynamic commercial markets.
We continue to develop exceptional service-oriented banking teams across the country, which are focused on
generating and enhancing the valuable commercial relationships that we have targeted. This progress has
benefited the funding side of our bank as well. In 2017, 78% of our deposits were in northeast branches.
As of the end of the first quarter, that number has declined to 45%. We have diverse niche funding businesses
and a robust branch network across Florida and Alabama. This diversity helps to insulate our funding base and
provides unique and differentiated opportunities to further reduce our reliance on wholesale funding over time.
On last quarter's call, I laid out three strategic imperatives for the coming year. Our early results indicate solid
traction relative to enhancing our cost effective core deposit funding, the de-emphasis of commercial real estate
and more revenue diversity. As mentioned, we will continue to accelerate the diversification of our loan portfolio
and I have all the confidence we'll continue to produce solid results.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results. After Mike
concludes his remarks, Tom, Mike, myself and Mark Saeger, our Chief Credit Officer, will be available for your
questions.

Thank you, Ira. Slide 9 illustrates the quarter's deposit trends. Total deposits declined slightly due to the
intentional runoff of higher cost time deposits, which had matured. From a customer deposit perspective, this
runoff is primarily offset by growth in interest-bearing non-maturity deposits within our specialty deposit niches.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Our ability to tactically reduce deposit pricing in certain product types and categories helped to meaningfully slow
the pace of deposit cost increases during the quarter. Despite a rotation of approximately $200 million of non-
interest deposits into interest-bearing deposits, our total cost of deposits increased a modest 3 basis points.
The next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business
line. Traditional branch deposits declined slightly as a result of the runoff of certain higher cost time deposits. That
said, we saw stable deposit trends in our Southeast franchise. Our specialty niches increased slightly during the
quarter as our online deposits and technology business continue to expand.
Slide 11 illustrates the management actions, which reduced loans during the quarter. Total loans declined nearly
$300 million, driven primarily by commercial real estate and construction participations out of the bank.
Importantly, these participations were executed with no negative impact to equity. We continue to monitor
opportunities to further participate out certain loans and to enable certain maturing loans to refinance away from
Valley. The sequential reduction in C&I loans was due entirely to the sale of our commercial premium finance
business and subsequent maturities in that remaining portfolio. We continue to focus our origination efforts on
traditional C&I, owner-occupied real estate and healthcare.
On slide 12, I would highlight that our loan to values are based on the most recent appraisal received on the
property. The average life of these appraisals is approximately 2.5 years. Our debt service coverage ratios are
calculated based on the most recent borrower financial formation that we have, which is typically received at least
annually.
The following two slides provide additional detail on our multifamily and office portfolios. We continue to have
modest exposure to New York multifamily loans and highlight that a near $531 million or roughly 20% of that sub-
portfolio has more than 50% rent controlled units. Our office portfolio remains diverse by geography and
supported by generally diverse cash flows with nearly 65% of our loans to multi-tenant properties.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarter's financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Staying on the CRE topic for a moment, slide 15 illustrates the contractual maturities of our
commercial real estate portfolio. We also included the LTV, DSCR and rate by maturity bucket for your benefit.
This maturity schedule illustrates the minimal repricing risk of our loans maturing over the next few quarters.
Slide 16 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. The modest sequential
declines in both net interest income and net interest margin were primarily the result of one fewer day in the
quarter. We strategically lowered deposit costs by approximately 40 basis points on nearly $10 billion of deposits,
which helped to stabilize net interest income as the quarter progressed. This helped to offset the headwind
associated with lower average non-interest bearing deposits during the quarter. After shortening our liability
duration during the first quarter, we locked in a small amount of long-term funding at relatively attractive costs,
which will further benefit net interest income during the second quarter, all else equal.
Turning to the next slide, you can see that non-interest income on an adjusted basis improved meaningfully from
the fourth quarter of 2023. A portion of this improvement was related to rebounding deposit service charges as
some fees were waived around our conversion in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Beyond this, we offset headwinds in swap revenue on commercial loan transactions with improved wealth
revenues and a very strong quarter from our tax credit advisory business. On that front, Dudley Ventures had
certain tax credit transactions closed during the quarter, which had been delayed from the end of 2023. While
demand for our tax credit advisory services continues to grow, we would anticipate that Dudley's revenues will
decline somewhat from this quarter's elevated levels.
On the following slide, you can see that our non-interest expenses were approximately $280 million for the
quarter. Adjusting for our $7.5 million FDIC special assessment and certain other non-core charges, non-interest
expenses were approximately $267 million on an adjusted basis. This represents a 2% decline from the adjusted
fourth quarter of 2023 and a near 1% increase on a year-over-year basis. The quarter's increase in compensation
costs was primarily the result of seasonal payroll tax impacts, as head count remains generally well controlled.
We saw notable reductions in our technology and consulting expenses as the costs associated with our core
conversion in the fourth quarter of 2023 continued to run off. While revenue pressures have weighed on our
efficiency ratio in recent quarters, our expense base continues to be stable relative to our balance sheet and well
below peer levels for the same comparison.
The key pillars on slide 19 not only support our conservative underwriting and strong credit performance, but also
our ability to mitigate losses in periods of stress. I will discuss this more in a moment.
Slide 20 offers a general comparison of our lending approach as a relationship-based regional bank with more
transactional oriented institutions. We have deep market knowledge and bank well-known and active investors
who are strongly aligned with the need to protect and enhance their property values over time. Our borrowers
tend to be more disciplined and value oriented with respect to project selection.
From an underwriting perspective, we generally focus on in-place, not projected cash flows, which provides an
added buffer, should NOI growth not materialize. we hope these pages provide some further context for the credit
results illustrated on slides 21 and 22. On 21, you can see the continued stability in our non-accrual and past due
loan buckets. The bottom charts illustrate our allowance for credit loss coverage relative to loans and past due
loans.
As Ira mentioned, the quarter's increase in allowance was primarily related to quantitative reserves associated
with the migration of loans into criticized and classified categories. We remain confident with the performance and
potential loss content of these loans. We are comfortable with the current position of the allowance, but
acknowledge that further real estate stress and elevated interest rates could move our allowance coverage
somewhat beyond 1% during the remainder of 2024.
Turning to slide 22. Net charge-offs ticked up during the quarter as a result of a $9.5 million charge-off related to
taxi medallion loans. Commercial real estate charge-offs were de minimis.
We present two important analysis at the bottom of this slide. On the bottom left, we compare loss given default
ratios on our commercial real estate and construction loans to peers over a variety of timeframes. Loss given
default is a calculation of charge-offs relative to non-accrual loans. This analysis suggests that over time, our non-
accrual loans were significantly less likely to be charged off than our peers given our loss mitigation techniques.
The most important loss mitigation tool that we have in times of stress is typically the deep resources and liquidity
of our wealthy borrower base.

On the bottom right, we illustrate our reserve relative to implied years of coverage based on certain loss rates.
While our allowance coverage is below peers on an absolute basis, we believe that relative to potential loss
content, we remain consistently better reserved. For example, our current reserve would cover six years of
implied loan losses based on the average net charge-off rate between 2001 and 2023. This is double the relative
reserve coverage of our peers. We remain confident that we are well-positioned for a potential deterioration of
credit quality across the industry.
Our below peer loss rates relative to total loans and CRE loans specifically are illustrated on slide 23. As we have
said historically, our loss rates tend to be roughly 40% of peer levels through the cycle.
The next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios. Tangible book value
increased slightly from the fourth quarter of 2023, despite a modest headwind from the OCI impact associated
with our available for sale securities portfolio. Regulatory capital ratios have continued to expand. And as Ira
mentioned earlier, we anticipate further expansion for the rest of 2024 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

I want to start – so, Ira, first on the CRE concentration moving down to 440% lower. Could you give us a sense of
your $32 billion of CRE loans in the quarter, including construction? Where should we expect those to trend for
the rest of the year? And do you think you could continue to do what you did this quarter, exit at par?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think when we look at that CRE concentration, it's really a function of not including the owner-occupied
loans into that. So I think on one of our slides, when we give the breakout of the balance sheet, probably gives a
bit better of what that starting number looks like. I think we had a really successful quarter in working with
[indiscernible] (00:22:48) and some of the other partners that we work with over the years and looking at
increased participations.

As you can see on the loan yield maturities that we have coming due, there really is not a significant variance
versus where our current portfolio sits versus where market indications or rates are today. So there really isn't a
rate issue as our – which would hinder some of our ability to really offset some of the loans that we have from a
participation perspective.
And as you've seen over the years, the credit quality has been really, really stellar here. And as people have gone
through and looked at the loans, they tend to agree with that assessment as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. I'm curious Ira, so the stock's off, I think it's a little over 30% this year. And you mentioned
perception, I believe, in terms of on the real estate portfolio. When you compare yourselves, I mean, this is what
happened in the aftermath of New York Community, would you compare your pre-portfolio to peer banks, what do
you think the market's missing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I mean, I think to acknowledge that there is not an issue in commercial real estate on a macro perspective, I think,
would be putting my head in the sand. I think that said, if you really dive into the areas that are really under stress
today, I think office is an obvious, right? And that's just not a function of where interest rates are. That's behaviors
have actually changed. The rent regulated in New York City is another area of stress. And then I think from a third
perspective is it's the repricing risk that exists.
So if you just really isolate those three specific areas and then dive into the underlying details of where Valley is
on those three specifics, on the office portfolio, it's about $3.3 billion. But when you look at the specific underlying
metrics of those loans, they're very small in size.
In addition to that, what we tried to do is give you an update even on what those updated debt service coverage
ratios are. So we're sitting at 1.68 times of debt service coverage ratio on the office portfolio, which I think is very
differentiated. I would say the larger differentiation on the office is actually the size. Our office is only $3 million on
average. I mean there really is not much stress within those types of offices that we're lending against. So I think
that's something that's probably a little bit differentiated.
And then on the rent regulated is obviously a little bit differentiated as well. As Tom mentioned in his prepared
comments, we're only sitting with about $500 million of rent regulated. That's north of 50% of what that
composition looks like. So once again, I think it's a very small portfolio and very manageable as we think about
what the risk of that portfolio looks like. Everything's current today [ph] with things in that (00:25:21) portfolio.
And then I think the third one that I alluded to was really the rate reset risk. And we tried to give a little bit more
granularity in the earnings call as well as in the presentation. The rate reset risk is not what it's like as many of our
peers here.
That said, look, I acknowledge the CRE concentration is pretty significant. And on a macro level, we look at the
concentration. And people just have a perspective of what that is at Valley. So I'm aware of that. I acknowledge it.
I think as an organization, we need to begin to reduce what that macro CRE concentration is. But at Valley, CRE
concentration doesn't mean that you're going to have an absolute loss. We migrated some loans into classified
and criticized loans this specific quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
As we mentioned before, the loss history is very, very different here at Valley as well. Because the loan gets
classified as a criticized loan here, does not mean you're going to have a loss associated with that. We've proven
that year-over-year. I think in the third quarter, we had a significant increase in what our classified loans were as
well. And if you look at the results this quarter, there's not an uptick in non-accrual, there's not an uptick in
delinquency, yet we had an uptick in classified a few quarters ago.
So I think it's just getting familiar with the granularity of what our portfolio is, which takes time for some people and
takes effort as well. That said, we have patients here and we're very comfortable that over the long term, we're
going to end up in a really good spot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask one other one and change direction. On the expense, the updated expense
guide just as below low end of the range, what actions you guys think, you've done a lot, right, over the past few
years? And what is the new range in terms of what you're thinking for expense growth this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think it's hopefully lower than where it is today. I think we announced on last call – not last call, excuse me, last
year, right, when we started to really see some additional pressure associated with the inverted yield curve that
we're going to put forth a 5% head count reduction in June of last year. When you look at the actual numbers, we
went from 3,912 employees in June of 2023. We're sitting at 3,709 employees today. So we've decreased by
5.2% on the employee head count overall. We think there's more opportunity to continue that overall focus.
And I think the bigger piece is, Steve, that people underestimate the amount of resources from an internal and
external perspective associated with the core conversion that we did at the end of 2023. A significant amount of
expense was associated with that, and we continue to really begin to recognize some of the benefits of being on
one platform. And we think that will continue throughout 2024 as well.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
As we think about commercial real estate growth in light of the updated guidance and actions this quarter, should
we expect active runoff in that book? And if so, to what extent? Or should we expect that loan segment to
essentially remain flattish while all the other segments, C&I especially, grow around it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Matt, it's Tom. As you see, we revised our guidance for our total loans to be between 0% and 4% from
the 5% to 7% annualized. We are intentionally managing our real estate portfolio by focusing on our top
relationship-driven clients. We originated about $750 million in real estate loans in the first quarter, which is down
significantly from what we have done in the past few years. We will still be active and involved in real estate, but
we will still continue to sell loans. The loans that are not relationship-driven, we'll let them mature and leave. In the
first quarter, there were about $500 million of loans that matured and exited to other banks, and I'll point out, all at
full value to the bank. We're not changing our C&I expectations. We've grown that portfolio 10% on an annual
basis. Outside of the premium finance sale, where we have been slightly up in the first quarter. First quarter is
traditionally a slow quarter. We tend to get [ph] loan utilization paydowns (00:29:55). Our owner-occupied portfolio
in the first quarter grew 6% annualized. So that's a positive event. Our pipelines and C&I are very stable, and we
originated $1 billion of C&I loans in the
first quarter, which is in line with what we have done in the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, with CECL, it feels like we were all [ph] taught to (00:30:22) think about historical losses
and forward-looking economic factors. And the reserve was supposed to be catered to each institution based on
these assumptions. But in the wake of newer community and now the category for bank classification, it feels like
there's a third leg to the stool, which is your peer group and what they're doing.
Is it fair to assume with that in mind that longer term, beyond what you've outlined for the intermediate term, that a
lot of your ratios, commercial real estate, reserve capital, needs to migrate to your category for peer like levels
despite whatever CECL says in terms of your quarter-to-quarter change in reserving?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bank, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Matthew, this is Mark Saeger. Just as it relates to our model, one of the positives is we use a transition
matrix model, which is very sensitive to migration in the portfolio. We hold an elevated level of reserves against
criticized and classified credits. So we get an immediate bump through the migration in our reserve, which shows
the appropriateness of that migration, not just loss. And about two-thirds of the increase in our reserve for the
quarter was related to migration within the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think on a macro basis though, Matt, I mean, with – to your specific question, do we have to be at where peer
levels are, right, I think at our size organization, we're only $60 billion, it's a long runway for us to get to $100

billion. So to look at where those reserve ratios are and automatically imply that we need to be at those levels
based on sort of this third perspective of what CECL looks like, I think, would be an incorrect assumption.
I think the accounts are pretty clear, what drives the CECL model. And as Mark mentioned, it's going to uptick a
little bit because of what we're seeing with the transition and a bit of an increase in some of those classified loans
and criticized loans. But I don't think there's a guidance as we need to be at whatever the $100-billion-plus banks
are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I guess I'm more concerned about the CRE concentration because that – those peers operate at a median of
100% concentration, the highest is M&T. They're around $180 billion, $190 billion, and we're a long way off from
that. So by the time you get to $100 billion, you have to have made some significant changes along the way. And
I'm curious if that's part of the plan here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think, obviously, going to $100 billion and saying we're going to have 400% CRE concentration is something that
that doesn't make any sense. That said, obviously, we have a very long runway, Matt. I mean, if you even took a
10% growth rate on our balance sheet today, it's over six years before we even get to $100 billion. And there's a
lot that's going to happen at Valley over the next 6-ish years. And I think getting the CRE concentration down is
something we talked about for years now of what the strategic focus has really been here.
We've instituted C&I business lines from the tech business to a commodities business, to all different types of C&I
businesses, many, many years ago with a focus on beginning to diversify what that portfolio looks like. As Tom
mentioned, we're growing C&I 10% annualized. So it's not like we woke up one day and said, hey, the CRE
concentration is too high. We need to begin to establish some of these foundational C&I businesses. We've been
doing it for years. And we've actually seen a lot of positive outcomes associated with that C&I business as well.
So, obviously, the CRE cannot be the same level at Valley that it's been historically, and we put a lot of good
strategic initiatives in place to really begin to drive C&I business here that we've seen the fruits of for many years
now, and we anticipate continuing to accelerate that.

Last one for me and then I'll hop back in the queue. Tom, you had mentioned undergoing, it sounds like fairly
extensive stress test for your commercial real estate book. And it shows that over time, you've had better loss
content versus peers. Curious what types of assumptions were overlaid in that – in those stress tests. And at the
end of the day, what was the kind of loss content, what was the charge-offs that stress has resulted in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
So we don't publish, needless to say, our specific stress test assumptions, but we do stress occupancy, rent per
square foot, vacancies, overall rate and market conditions as part of that stress testing and then test that against
our overall capital to ensure that we're remaining a well-capitalized organization.

Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Matt, and I think one thing I would just add to that is the size of the scope of what we do when it comes to the
credit review process. We laid out on slide 19, really Valley-specific credit framework. And that's really led to a lot
of the lower loss given defaults that Mike mentioned earlier. We – manually credit officers looked at over 60% of
the commercial real estate portfolio just this last quarter. So stress testing for us isn't just what assumptions you're
applying to those stress testing, but the scale of what that stress testing is. It's not just, hey, let's look at a couple
loans that are coming due in the next 12-ish months. It's really deep dives on each of these individual portfolios.
So what you're seeing in the migration this quarter isn't just reflective of loans that are coming due in the next 12-
ish months. It's 60% of the entire CRE book that we have.

Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, guys. Good morning. Just to follow up on the last line of question a little bit. Just on the – I just want to make
sure I understand, on slide 5, the reserve. Mike, you talked about being relatively comfortable with where reserves
are. And given loss rates, you have actually better reserved than peers in many ways. But – so just trying to
understand when we get to the roughly [ph] 1.10 (00:36:49) reserve over the next 12 to 24 months. So what's the
driver there? Is it as the commercial real estate book matures and reprices or is that just kind of more – as you
grow, getting in line with peers over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think from a macro perspective, it's probably two things, right? Obviously, the CRE reviews that we do and the
migration associated with that has really benefited us from what the loss given defaults are. So potentially, there's
going to be a bit more migration to what that CRE looks like as we go through the rest of the portfolio.
And I think one of the other drivers is really on the C&I side. As we continue to originate more C&I loans, they're
going to come at a higher reserve ratio than what the rest of the historical CRE does. So that's automatically
going to end up driving up what that coverage ratio looks like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay. And then just wondering about the potential to accelerate some of this reduction in concentration.
You obviously moved some stuff out of CRE at par this quarter. And obviously, it seems like there's been some

opportunity on the commercial side. We've certainly seen commercial teams moving around, I'd say, given – to a
greater degree, given some of the dislocation in the marketplace, let's say. So I'm just curious, as you think about
that, if that's something that you guys are seeing potential there to maybe accelerate this to greater mix shift in the
near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think maybe I'll start, if you don't mind, and then I'll turn it over to Tom. But I think one of the constraints that
we've always operated in here is what that tangible book value number is, right? And it's really been a focus
within the organization to not dilute shareholders through tangible book value transactions, as we mentioned
earlier, whether it be through silly M&A transactions that have very long buybacks or through balance sheet
restructures. I mean, we see that today and what's happening with some securities books we see, what's
happening with also sales.
So I think that's a constraint that we look at to make sure what our alternatives are that we have to make sure that
that tangible book value and capital really continue to grow within the organization. That said, we were able to
execute a lot at par today. And...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Frank, in your referencing question regarding deposit-driven commercial teams, we have opportunistically added
teams in certain markets, including the Southeast and the North.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. I guess the big – it just seems like there's a lot of movement. I don't know if maybe some of these
things end up being too expensive on the front end of things. Obviously, you guys reduced your expense guide a
bit. Yeah. So I was just curious if maybe there was a significant pickup opportunity here just in the near term.
We've obviously seen some other press releases from other places. And so, I was just curious about anything in
the near term of size.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe then I misunderstood your question at first and I apologize. I thought you were going a little bit more
on the loan side and I should just defer to Tom right after that. Look, I think as we mentioned on the call, we're
seeing a lot of growth in that Southeast market. So some of the dislocation that you're seeing up here in the
Northeast with people coming with teams, they obviously come at a significant expense. We've looked at some of
them. And the marginal cost to bring on some of those deposits, when you combine it with the expense of those
teams, we're finding much, much cheaper alternatives elsewhere. And that's where we intend to allocate a lot of
our resources to.

Hey, [ph] Chris (00:41:08), we can hear you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Yeah. It's [ph] Chris (00:41:12). In terms of, Ira, the capital, the $9.8 million by the end of the year and $10
million plus over the next 12 to 24, how do you get to those numbers? I'm just interested to kind of – I understand
the mechanics of how you would get there. But how did you get, I guess, more importantly, to the $10 million
plus? Some of your peers are kind of mid-10s, even $11 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think, look, in overall, [ph] Chris (00:41:37), we've talked a lot about relative to our peers that our
allowance and capital ratios, we justified them being slightly below where peers are, understanding that they still
need to be higher than where we are today. So I don't know if your question is on kind of the immediate term or
kind of where we view ourselves in the long term, but if you look at that near-term expectation column, all these
metrics reflect kind of organic efforts or things on the margin, like what we did this quarter in terms of selling off
certain commercial real estate loans at par.
So there's no significant rash actions that are embedded in the near-term expectation column. And then it's a
continuation of those efforts over time that gets you over to the right-hand column. So not sure if that's the
answer, but...

Q
Just a follow-up on that. Would there be any situation where you would do like a credit linked note or some sort of
RWA mitigation to accelerate that? You've seen some peers do that with success.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I would say that all RWA optimization opportunities are on the table. And there are certain portfolios that lend
themselves more to that than others, but we have a very diverse balance sheet and we have portfolios like auto
and residential that could be good opportunities for transactions like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay, great. And then maybe just two housekeeping. Do you have – maybe I missed it. The CRE concentration
metric in the first quarter and then also the quarter-on-quarter change in the criticized, classified special mention, I
know you mentioned a little bit high level, but any specifics there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. The CRE ratio is going to be about 464%, so it should be down about 10% from December 31. And Mark

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Saeger A

Just a follow-up on the – yeah, follow-up on the last answer to [ph] Chris' (00:43:55) question. Are you guys telling
us just to expect higher criticized and classified loans each quarter? It sounds like you're doing a deep dive

Just pointing to what Ira spoke to before, we did a special review on the sensitive asset classes and overall
portfolio touching a little over 60% of the portfolio in the first quarter with a focus on rent stabilized and office. So
while I anticipate because of the high rate environment that we will continue to have some migration throughout
the year, we do believe that the first quarter migration was elevated because of the focus of the reviews and the
percent of the portfolio that was reviewed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
...let me go back to the first quarter and then I'll give you the guidance. So generally, the first quarter results were
in line with our expectations on a day count basis and the modest headwinds, as it relates to net interest income,
were really the non-interest bearing deposits and slower loan growth, but those were also offset by some deposit
cost reductions that we've spoken about as well, and we continue to look at that.
The guidance being revised slightly down is, again, a function of a starting point with lower non-interest bearing
deposits, and again, this lower loan growth that we talked about, especially when you consider the participations
that we've visited about being in the latter part of the first quarter. So that impact is in the numbers in the first
quarter as much as it will be in the second quarter.
And then while we did assume fewer Fed cuts, I would assume most people are doing that, remember that long-
end rates are forecasted to be higher relative to where they were as the start off point in 12/31. So that on a net
basis, the shifting yield curve, whether it's on the higher or the short end is a modest benefit to us because we're
more exposed on the long end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. That makes sense to me. And Ira, if I heard you correctly, you said with these guidance changes,
you would still expect relatively consistent PPNR to what you said before these adjustments. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Absolutely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So it's just – for us, it's a question of trying to figure out what the provision is. That's – and that's – and
you're just saying some modest growth in the reserve, PPNR stays the same, just the geography on the income
statement is different. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think we've tried to give you some guidance as to where those numbers could shake out. But obviously, look, it's
market dependent, as Mark said. We've gone through and looked at a lot of the portfolio already. That said, we're
going to continue to monitor the portfolio and do the credit reviews. We believe that that's really been a strong
point for us and the ability to have the significant reviews that we do as it's driven down to lower loss given
default.

So it's been part of a hallmark of who we are in actively managing the portfolio and not just waiting for something
to happen. So we are all over every single loan that we have and we continue to really be. And as market
conditions change, we'll adjust them accordingly.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. With all the puts and takes on the loan side that you just discussed and given the fixed rate
loan repricing and the 40% of loans being floating rate, how should we think about the loan yield expansion from
this quarter's levels under a three rate cut scenario?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think you've seen the pace of loan yield growth has slowed as rates have stabilized generally on the front
end. So that immediate benefit has kind of played itself out probably, but you do obviously have some tailwinds.
And when we show you, I think, in the deck, we show that maturing CRE slide, that may be a good kind of guide
to help you in terms of what's coming off and then where you're putting things back on. We originated loans. Loan
yields this quarter are still in the high 7s. So I think on a CRE perspective, our CRE origination yield was 7.80%.
So there's still some opportunity to enhance loan yields there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. I appreciate that. And then, you noted that you purchased some Ginnies this quarter. Is there more room
to do that? And how should we think about the level of on-balance sheet liquidity that you want to manage to over
the next few quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So the Ginnie Mae purchases, obviously, they're zero risk-weighted. They average about three to four
years and the yields on that portfolio on recent purchases, I should say, have been in the 5%, slightly more than
5% range. The runoff on the portfolio, there's really no prepayment. So it's going to be just the stated maturity
payoffs run around $75 million to $90 million a quarter, and we would continue to add, we believe, in zero risk-
weighted Ginnies at probably 5% to 5.5% yields.

Got it. So in terms of the on-balance sheet liquidity you need to maintain from here, is there a room for that to
move up or do you think you're at the right level? And I ask in context of – you also mentioned that the LDR
should trend below 100% in 2025. So I just want to get a sense of what the right level of liquidity is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I want to make sure I'm answering. You're referring specifically to, say, FHLB or Federal Reserve availability?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think overall, you're probably going to see a little bit more on-balance sheet liquidity, not to a significant degree,
but part of getting the loan-to-deposit ratio down to 100% will definitely be a little bit of the core deposits coming
on and being reinvested in securities as opposed to going into loans. But I don't think you really need to look at a
significant shift within what that securities book looks like.

Yeah. Looking at the CRE sales that you did this quarter, being able to do those at par is great. I guess that's a
little surprising though, just given where rates are, that there wasn't even like a rate mark on there. Could you give

participation on that?

think, 7.4% and up, fixed side was 7.4% to 7.5%. They were all participated at par. We retained a portion as lead

bank on those. On the floating side, they were mostly prime-plus construction loans. And again, we retained a
position in those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
I think that last point is pretty important too, because we're preserving the customer relationships. And as you
heard Ira say in the prepared remarks, I mean, CRE's a very valuable asset class. We'll remain in it. We have a
deep pool of high-quality commercial real estate borrowers, but there are ways that we can balance the need to
manage the balance sheet with preserving and building those customer relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then following up, what's the expectation for deposit growth from here? And then as we look
at some of the promotional products that are rolling off, where are you seeing those coming on at, where is the
new product coming in terms of term and price?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
While we've continued to have the non-interest bearing rotation, one of the really bright spots has been the growth
in the savings now, which has more than offset what we've lost in non-interest bearing or rotated into non-interest
or out of non-interest bearing into other products. And the growth in our niche businesses has been very strong as
well.
And maybe a harbinger of – or an indicator of the future growth and the strength there is just in the first quarter
alone, on a net basis, we added over 3,000 net new deposit accounts. So we feel pretty good. What I'm telling
you is I think the growth is going to come out of the niche businesses and the continued efforts in our retail
branches to grow households. And to the extent that we could see a flattening of rotation of non-interest bearing,
that's only going to help us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Maybe, Jared, I'll add just two different pieces to that. Last call, we talked about, at least me specifically, some of
the disappointment I had and where the funding costs have gone within the organization. So we were very
proactive in going out and looking at $10 billion of different deposit products across the organization and lowering
those from a 40 basis points. And that did not happen in the first period, assuming that the first month – the
quarter, but it happened throughout the quarter. So we think there's going to be some tailwind associated with that
as we continue to think about deposit cost.
That said, the new originations came on very, very strong in deposits for the quarter. The cost was only 3.23%
and there's well over $1 billion of net new originations that came in. And obviously, some of that offset some of
the higher cost time deposits that Tom meant or something that Mike mentioned that ran off. So I think we've
done a really good job bringing in newer deposits into the organization at a much lower cost than what marginal
cost of some of the current deposits that we have here. And we've also been able to be very successful in
bringing down some of the cost of deposits that's sitting on the book right now. So we believe that there's a lot of
tailwind associated with that.

Yes. We manage it weekly. We look at the levels. And we have not seen any significant change in those levels
from the groups where we reduced.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then in terms of – on credit here, with the deep dive you guys took on the specific
portfolios, you guys mentioned that you examined the office portfolio, had migration there. Just curious, what is
the specific reserve for office? And then also along those lines, just curious, are you looking primarily at the
22

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
specific properties or are you looking at the borrowers' global cash flows? I'm just kind of curious as to how those
global cash flows are holding up these days.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bank, Valley National Bancorp
No, absolutely. Let me address the end of the question. Yeah. As part of our standard credit process, we look at
not only the property that we finance, but the overall global cash flow of any of the developers that we do
business with to get that overall view to see if not stressed in our property, are there stressed, and is global or
vice versa strength in the global cash flow and weakness in property. All of those factors go into the risk rating
and the migration in portfolio. We don't publish a separate office reserve. But as I mentioned earlier, we have
substantially higher level of reserves for criticized assets and there is an elevated level of criticized assets in our
office portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
And the only thing I just want to add to that is many of our customers are in multiple classes of assets, not just in
a single class.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. And maybe just in terms of the office portfolio, I think it was 1.58 times or 1.68 times, I forget the debt
service coverage ratio right now. But like are a lot of those borrowers in the current environment headed towards
1 times? Just kind of curious as to how much capital a borrower might have to put up to kind of right size those
loans these days.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bank, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And I think you see the granularity in the portfolio, with a $3 million average loan size, in that we do look in
the individual cases with migrated. Clearly, there was stress in debt service coverage on those assets,
necessitating the downgrade. But historically, our leverage on office assets and our going-in coverage was
exceptionally strong to long-term customers that we have relationships with, which we also believe assist in the
overall performance of that portfolio in the long run.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Steve, we showed the average loan size. I mean, I don't like to indicate the granularity and diversity of the
portfolio. But in reality, to your last question, and it doesn't apply just to office, it's I think across the portfolio, given
our average loan size, when a borrower does need to bring additional cash reserves or equity into a deal, these
are low average loan sizes that require less in terms of absolute dollars to right size things. And I think that's a
benefit and a component of the loss mitigation and credit management.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one more related to commercial real estate office. Are you – where you're seeing the
migration, is it in your larger loans these days or is it across the board?

Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bank, Valley National Bancorp
So I would say from – it's really more geographically focused. So our largest percentage of office is in the Florida,
Alabama market, and we've seen much lower level of migration in that portfolio, with the majority of migration in
the Northeast, in the New Jersey and New York marketplace, but noting that our Manhattan exposure is quite
granular and quite small in this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then just stepping back from things here, Ira, I was just curious here with the plan to
reduce commercial real estate concentrations, it might not be easy to do a deal today, but just curious as to how
the shift is changing your thinking on the M&A front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think this is the strategic initiatives and plan that we've outlined for a couple years now. So I think we're
just looking at accelerating some of the things that we're doing. If there's an M&A opportunity that helps
accelerate some of the strategic initiatives, well, definitely it's something we would look at. That said, the
guardrails around tangible book value are real to me. So obviously, the valuation in today's market limits the
ability to do some of that. But M&A that really accelerates strategic initiatives is something that's definitely that we
are, as an organization, are open to.

Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on expenses. It looks like we could see a decent reduction here. Could you talk
about what areas you're pulling back on and any initiatives that are getting pushed to the back burner?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think from a macro perspective, obviously, there's going to be less activity in volume in certain loan classes. So
there's probably going to be some continued reduction in those specific areas, but I think a large piece of it goes
back to what we talked about last quarter. The core conversion that we had here took significant resources from
an internal perspective and from an external perspective. And as we continue to get the benefits of migrating onto
one core platform, we do believe that there's going to be some sales from that, definitely not to the degree, I think,
24


Valley National Bancorp
(VLY) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
that we saw the contraction from last year to now. But that said, we do think that there's opportunity on the
expense side of the book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And maybe to give you an example to hopefully make this real, prior to conversion – core conversion, we ran on
three separate GL systems and we had two different core systems. We closed the books this quarter, the fastest
we've done in the time that I've been at Valley. So that's a good example of showing the efficiency in the core
conversion and how it has ancillary benefits that kind of spill through the whole organization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for that. And I also want to follow up on the question on liquidity. I guess to put a finer point on it, cash and
securities as a percent of assets was 11%. Should we expect that 11% to kind of trend higher here over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think slowly over time, directionally, that makes sense, but I don't think there's any bulk action that's going
to occur at any point. I mean that's just, in general direction, we've trended higher, if you look back over the last
couple of years, and we'll continue to do so. We have a very stable deposit base. It's very granular. And so we
think we're well positioned to this today. But just directionally too, as we grow, we will continue to have more cash
and securities.

Slide 12 and 13, the debt service coverage ratios were really helpful. A modest migration is one to be expect. Is it
fair to say that all of those now include 2023 annuals? Are we still waiting on a little bit? I'm just trying to look for
the most up-to-date type ratio there.

Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bank, Valley National Bancorp
On a large portion of our portfolio, we do have updated current rent roll information. I don't believe 100% of them,
though, clearly include 2023 numbers. And we think that in all asset classes other than office, we've seen strength
in NOI growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. And then I noticed some multifamily down here in the Southeast, is that Florida Alabama came down a
decent amount quarter-over-quarter, any commentary on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Ben, we'll go back and take a look at the number. You mean the debt service coverage came down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. It went from basically -
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It also happens to be the same number – no, I'll go back and take a look at it because it happens to be the
same number as the row above. And so I'll take a look at it and get back to everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. And then lastly, I know it's been a long call and I apologize if you're going to repeat yourself. But did
you guys give a monthly or aggregated spot rate on deposit cost?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
We did not give a spot rate. You can see in the IP that the total deposit costs went from 3.13% to 3.16%, so
they're up 3 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Matthew Breese from
Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. I had two quick follow-ups. The first one was just on the taxi medallion charge off. What happened there?
Was that part of the credit review? It just seems like a fairly big charge given how far away we are from kind of the
height of the tax medallion days. What's the remaining balance on that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
The remaining balance, we have $52 million left in portfolio that's fully reserved down to current market prices. For
the charge-off that we experienced this quarter, that was also fully reserved for. It was one relationship of a
customer who had been paying. We were in a long-term negotiation and kind of hit a standstill. Subsequent to the
charge-off, we have entered into a forbearance agreement and that loan has continued to pay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Okay. And then just in light of a slower loan growth outlook, could you just stack order for us capital
deployment priorities? And I'm really curious if share repurchases become part of the plan here, even if a little bit.
The other thing is understanding, Ira, your comments on M&A, would FDIC-assisted deals be something you look
at should they arise? That's all I had. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think from a capital deployment perspective, allocating capital to growing the CRE book is probably not
going to happen here. There's ample opportunity internally just to serve our current CRE clients. So I think that's
probably where more of the focus would end up being. But once again, we are seeing strong C&I growth than we
have for a couple years now. So allocating capital to those specific segments seems to be a much better return to
us today.
From an M&A perspective, I think, once again, if it's something that's strategic and makes sense, we would look
at it. But once again, the guardrails around in tangible book value is some of that's significant to me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. That's all I had. Thank you.
