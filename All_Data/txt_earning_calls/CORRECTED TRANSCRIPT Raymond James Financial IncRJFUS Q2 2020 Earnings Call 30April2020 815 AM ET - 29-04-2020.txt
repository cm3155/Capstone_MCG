With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Before we begin I just want to note that our thoughts and prayers
are with all of those impacted both directly and indirectly by the COVID-19 virus. This has been a difficult time for
all of us and we certainly hope you and all your families are doing well.
The financial services industry has certainly had its ups and downs replicationally over the many years. But I can
tell you today I'm proud of our industry. Even though this pandemic time where we are focused on getting
associates at home, we help keep the markets opened.
The industry has helped with the administrative â€“ the administration of government programs and helping
businesses and people get much needed cash. We have shared best practices on protecting employees and
associates, and everyone connected to the crisis was just trying to help during this national emergency.
And furthermore, I think the government, especially the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, has been unbelievable
at being open to support the markets in this very difficult time and to reach out to make sure that the programs
really worked.
Values are critical during good times. But they are the guiding light in terms of any crisis. As we navigated through
this crisis, our top priority was clear, the health and safety of our associates and advisors, and as well as our
clients. We have created and followed every case in RJ family to make sure that our associates and their families
were well equipped to handle the impact.
We quickly transitioned nearly 95% of our associates to working remotely and closed all employee branches while
providing continues service to our clients. We've also taken the additional steps to support our associates,
particularly those who are directly impacted by COVID-19, with working days of additional sick time, zero cost for
telemedicine, options for financial relief, and resources for emotional and the mental health of our associates,
some dealing with the stress of 2019 and some just the stress and challenges of the home environment with
working from home while kids were telecommuting to school.
In addition to ensuring for the health and safety of our associates, another priority is to maintain the continuous
service to support the clients during these challenging times. During the quarter, we experienced unprecedented
levels of client activity. For example, our top 10 trading days ever all occurred in March. We saw retail orders
more than double, transaction volumes more than triple, and institution volumes up 7 times on some days.
Our ability to provide continuous service to our advisors and clients without any significant disruptions is a
testament to the investments we made in our technology and mobile apps over the last 10 years. Just as
important, even during these [indiscernible] (00:01:03) and challenging conditions, our committed and
experienced support teams demonstrated our longstanding service firm spirit in supporting advisors and clients
even in a work at home environment. And true to our mission of Raymond James, we continued supporting our
communities in the US, Canada, UK during these challenging times. In fact, the commitments from our companies
and executives have surpassed $2 million that help relief for those that are in need and we anticipate doing more.
Our associates over the same period of time have personally stepped up to support their communities, I expected
no less. We are also supporting our communities through food and supply donations to aid local food banks and

clinics in our markets. Again, I cannot stress how proud I am of our Raymond James associates and advisors who
are quickly transitioning to our business continuity protocols and continued providing excellent service to clients.
Moving to slide 4, despite a tumultuous quarter, our second quarter financial performance , reflecting a
relative resiliency of our diversified and clients-focused business model. We generated record quarterly net
revenue of $2.07 billion, which was up 11% over prior year's fiscal second quarter and 3% over the preceding
quarter. The growth in net revenues was primarily attributable at the beginning of the quarter with record PCG
assets and fee-based accounts, as well as higher brokerage revenue due to the surge in market volatility in
March. We generated quarterly net income of $169 million or $1.20 per diluted share, which was down 35%
compared to the net income into the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 37% compared to the preceding
quarter. The significant decline in quarterly net income was largely caused by the $109 million bank loan loss
provision and valuation losses and our private equity investments. On an annualized basis, our return on equity
for the quarter was 9.9% and return on our tangible common equity or ROTCE was 10.8%.
Moving to slide 5, the significant declines in the equity markets in March resulted in a decrease of client assets
and led to clients shifting assets to cash, driving the client cash balances to surge 34% sequentially to a new
record of $52.9 billion. And despite disruption in March due to the nationwide shelter-in-place orders, we reached
a record number of private client financial advisors of 8,148, a net increase of 286 over March 2019 and 88 over
December 2019. These net additions of financial advisors is a function of strong retention and recruiting results,
and we really only had two full months in normal recruiting activity before the pandemic hit.
Net loans reached $21.8 billion, up 8% over the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 2% over the preceding
quarter. The growth in the bank's loans was largely attributable to about $300 million of corporate revolver
fundings and continued growth in residential mortgage, the PCG clients.
Now, on the segment results, starting on slide 6, the Private Client Group generated record quarterly net
revenues of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by higher asset management fees as these fees are billed on balances at
the beginning of the quarter, and higher brokerage revenues as trading volumes spiked in March. Growth of asset
management and brokerage revenue was partially offset by the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates,
open RJBDP fees, and from third-party banks, and net interest income.
Record quarterly pre-tax income for the segment was $170 million, up 29% year-over-year basis and 11%
sequentially. On the bottom of the slide, while client assets declined along with equity markets, you can see we
continued our consistent trend of growing the number of financial advisors, which has become increasingly rare in
our industry. In fact, over the last four quarters, financial advisors representing over $300 million of trailing 12
months production approximate $50 billion of assets where prior firms have affiliated with Raymond James, which
is a spectacular result.
Moving to slide 7, revenue in the Capital Markets segment primarily due to higher equity and fixed income
brokerage revenues in March, as well as equity underwriting revenues during the quarter. Despite the higher
revenues, the segment's pre-tax income declined largely due to losses on trading inventories during the quarter
as there was a significant year-over-year decline in M&A revenues compared to the very strong results in the prior
year's fiscal second quarter.
On the next slide, the Asset Management segment generated net revenue of $184 million and pre-tax income of
$73 million during the quarter, both flat with the record levels achieved in the preceding quarter. Results in this
segment reflected a portion of a steep decline in the equity markets in March as financial assets under
management are build based on a combination of balances of beginning the quarter, balances at the end of the
4

quarter, and average balances during the quarter. Financial assets under management fell to $128.2 billion,
decreases of 7% on a year-over-year basis and 15% sequentially, primarily attributable to decline in equity
markets as the S&P 500 Index declined 20% during the quarter, as well as net outflows for Carillon Tower
Advisers.
On slide 9, Raymond James Bank generated net revenues of $210 million, a 3% decline from the preceding
quarter, despite continued asset growth, largely attributable to a 21 basis points decline in the bank's net interest
margin during the quarter, reflecting the short-term interest rates, as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to
close to zero in the month of March. We expect continued NIM pressures, Paul Shoukry will detail a little later.
Pre-tax income of $14 million declined 90% to both prior year's fiscal second quarter and the preceding quarter,
primarily due to higher bank loan loss provision, which is a good segue into the next slide.
Slide 10 provides the history of Raymond James Bank key credit metrics since the financial crisis. You can see
that Raymond James Bank, consistent with the banking industry, has enjoyed several years of positive credit
trends since the financial crisis. In the second quarter, the loan portfolio continued to perform well, as indicated by
the low level of non-performing assets, which actually decreased due to a corporate loan pay-off earlier in the
quarter. There were also no net charge-offs during the quarter.
But as the COVID-19 crisis cause economic conditions to rapidly deteriorate at a really unprecedented piece of
scale, we increase the allowance for loan loss reserves, resulting in the bank's loan loss provision of $109 million
for the quarter. As a result, the loan loss â€“ allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans increased to
1.47% from 1.01% the preceding quarter. You can see our allowance for loan losses peaked at around 2.4% in
fiscal 2010. While our portfolio is much more diversified now, which Paul will discuss later in the call, we're also in
an unprecedented economic environment.
So, there's simply too much uncertainty to know how much credit deterioration will be caused by COVID-19.
However, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we do anticipate continuing to add to our allowance for
loan losses.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 11, we generated record net revenue of $4.08 billion during the
first half of fiscal 2020, up 8% over the first half of fiscal 2019, notably all four core operating segments generated
record net revenues during the first six months of the fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share of $3.09 declined
12% compared to the first half of 2019, again, primarily due to the bank's loan loss provisions. I will give an
outlook at the end of this call. But for now, I'm going to turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of
the financial results. Paul?

Thanks, Paul. And I'm being told that Paul's opening for a few minutes was missed because the operator forgot to
switch us over to the overall line, so maybe I'll ask Paul to repeat his industry remarks in the outlook.
Starting with revenues on slide 13, as Paul stated, we generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.07 billion,
which were up 11% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. Asset management fees were up 28% on a
year-over-year basis and 5% sequentially. PCG assets and fee-based accounts declined 14% during the fiscal
second quarter which will be reflected in the third quarter as these assets are billed at the beginning of each
quarter based on balances at the end of the preceding quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Brokerage revenues during the quarter of $515 million were strong as there was a surge in trading activity in both
Private Client Group and the Capital Markets segment in March. Account and service fees of $172 million
declined 10% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting the decrease in RJBDP fees
from third-party payments due to lower short-term interest rates.
Paul already discussed investment banking results and I'll discuss net interest income on the next two slides. But
quickly on Other revenues which were down substantially this quarter, reflecting valuation losses associated with
our private equity investments in the fiscal second quarter of $39 million.
And as you'll see on the upcoming expense details slide, $22 million of the valuation loss is attributable to non-
controlling interest and is presented as an offset in other expense. So the net impact of pre-tax income of the
valuation losses associated with the private equity investments was $17 million for the quarter, representing close
to a 20% decline in those valuations. The remaining value of these legacy private equity investments that is
attributable to Raymond James was around $80 million as of March 31, 2020.
Moving to slide 14, clients domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest
earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees ended the quarter at a record
$52.9 billion, representing 7.6% domestic PCG client assets as market volatility and the steep declines in the
equity markets in March led to clients shifting assets to cash. Other than quarterly fee payments, these balances
have remained relatively resilient thus far in April. However, we have shifted about [ph] $4 million (00:11:58) of
these cash balances from Raymond James Bank to third-party banks since the end of the quarter. The surging
cash balances in March highlight the advantages of our multi-bank sweep program which offers up to $3 million of
FDIC capacity to clients while also providing the firm significant flexibility to move the balances on or off balance
sheet as appropriate.
On slide 15, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis, as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. As you can see,
the rate cuts totaling 225 basis points since August have put significant pressure on these revenue streams which
on a combined basis are down $36 million compared to the prior year's fiscal second quarter despite loan growth
at Raymond James Bank and the surging cash balances this quarter.
On the bottom of the slide, it shows our bank's NIM decreasing to 3.02% this quarter. But as you all know, the last
150 basis points of cuts occurred in March. So we will continue to experience NIM compression in the fiscal third
quarter. We would expect the base NIM to decline to somewhere around 2.5% over the next quarter or two
depending on where LIBOR settles out.
On the bottom right portion of the slide, you can see that the average yield on RJBDP fees from third-party banks
fell to an average of 1.33% during the quarter. But again, given the timing of the rate cuts in March, we would
expect this yield to decline further to around 30 basis points starting in the fiscal third quarter. And while these
balances ended the quarter at $20.4 billion, we've shifted a significant amount of balances from Raymond James
Bank in April where they were earning about 10 basis points of the Federal Reserve or roughly 5 basis points net
of FDIC insurance premium, so there's currently approximately [ph] $23.5 million (00:13:55) of balances with third-
party banks reflecting the [ph] $4 million (00:13:59) shifted from Raymond James Bank in the fiscal third quarter -
since the fiscal third quarter and net of the outflows related to quarterly billings in April.
Now, I'll discuss expenses on slide 16. First compensation expense which is by far our largest expense. The
compensation ratio increased sequentially from 67.2% to 68.8% during the quarter. The compensation ratio was
negatively impacted by lower non-compensable revenues in the Private Client Group primarily due to lower short-

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
term interest rates, losses on trading inventories and the aforementioned valuation losses on private equity
investments. The private equity valuation losses reduced net revenues by $39 million and had a negative impact
of over 125 basis points to the total compensation ratio as there is no direct compensation associated with private
equity valuation adjustments. So if you look at the $71 million sequential increase in total compensation, the vast,
vast majority of it is attributable to direct payouts to financial advisors and the Private Client Group and direct pay-
off from the higher brokerage revenues in Capital Markets segment.
On to non-compensation expenses. Non-compensation expenses during the quarter were $407 million, increased
substantially due primarily to the large loan loss provision of $109 million in the quarter. As for the loan loss
provision, I just want to remind you all that due to our fiscal year-end on September 30, we do not implement
CECL until October 1 of this year. So the provisions this quarter really reflect our intent of downgrading credits
and taking more allowances for the loans that are most directly exposed to the COVID-19 crisis.
As I noted earlier, other expense included a $22 million offset related to the non-controlling interest of the
valuation losses on the private equity investments. Excluding that NPI offset, other expenses would have been
higher during the quarter, largely due to legal reserves in the Private Client Group segment. But almost all the
other expense categories came in close to where we expected. While there were some elevated expenses
associated with buying laptops for the relatively small portion of our associates, we still had desktops, an increase
in bandwidth and licenses to facilitate remote working arrangements, there are also offsets from lower travel costs
in March due to COVID-19.
We expect those travel expenses, the conference expenses, as those have been canceled over the next several
months, to remain lower than normal over the near-term. Most of those expenses show up as business
development expenses on the P&L. So, really, I think there may have been some confusion on a few of the
reports last night about our expenses being higher than expected. The compensation was higher due to higher
revenues than the Street anticipated and the compensation ratio was negatively impacted by over 125 basis
points by the private equity valuation losses, and the non-compensation expenses of $407 million were higher
than that $325 million we guided to last quarter solely due to the $109 million loan loss reserve.
Slide 17 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 11.6% in the fiscal
second quarter of 2020, negatively impacted by the large bank loan loss provision and lower short-term interest
rates. On the last call, we established a target of 67.5% for the compensation ratio, about $325 million per quarter
for non-compensation expenses, and 17% for the pre-tax margin. But those targets are no longer valid given the
significant changes in the market environment, near-zero short-term interest rate and the higher bank loan loss
provisions due to COVID-19. Assuming we have some market clarity by June, we will aim to provide new targets
then and at our upcoming Analyst & Investor Day which we now plan on holding virtually. We will let you know as
soon as we finalize the date. But we may postpone it if there is still too much market uncertainty to provide
updated targets.
On slide 18, at the end of the fiscal second quarter, total assets were nearly $50 billion, growing 24% sequentially.
This significant increase was largely attributable to the surge in client cash balances, about $7 billion of which
were deposited at Raymond James Bank. The significant balance sheet growth caused the Tier 1 leverage ratio
to decline to 14.2% which is still well, well above the regulatory requirements. And as I mentioned earlier, in April,
we already shifted approximately [ph] $4 million (00:18:23) of the cash balances off of Raymond James Bank's
balance sheet to third-party banks, reducing the size of the balance sheet which will have a positive impact on the
Tier 1 leverage ratio.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Liquidity is very strong as well. Cash at the parent company was about $2 billion. To further strengthen our
liquidity position during a time of unprecedented economic disruption, we successfully raised $500 million 10-year
senior notes in March at 4.65%, which is included in the $2 billion. While the debt markets were really only
accessible to the bluest chip companies in March, we were able to get around $2.5 million of subscriptions in the
first three hours after launching the transaction, a real testament to our strong balance sheet and long-term
conservative focus. And we also had an undrawn $500 million unsecured committed revolver which doesn't
mature until 2024.
So with a total capital ratio of 25.3%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 14.2%, and cash of the parent of around $2 billion,
we have substantial amounts of capital and liquidity with plenty of flexibility to be defensive during this global
pandemic and also opportunistic.
Slide 19 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters when we returned approximately
$750 million back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the board's authorization. During the
fiscal second quarter, the firm repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock for nearly $202
million at an average price of approximately $79 per share. Share buybacks have been suspended since mid-
March; and as at quarter-end, $537 million remains available under the board's previously disclosed repurchase
authorization. We believe it was prudent to suspend buybacks during this pandemic even though we do have a
significant amount of capital and liquidity.
On the next two slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio. Slide 20 provides some detail on
Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we have a really well-diversified
portfolio, with a focus over the past few years to really grow residential mortgages and securities-based loans to
Private Client Group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio which ended the
quarter at around $4 billion in our all agency-backed securities.
So, we have a much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis. And then, within
each category, we have significant amount of diversification as well. For example, within the C&I category, no
industry category represents more than 4.1% of total loans. You can see energy represent about 1.7% of total
loans, which I will detail on the next slide; airlines represent 1.5%; entertainment and leisure represents 1.2%;
restaurants represent 1.1%; and gaming only represents 0.7% of total loans.
Within commercial real estate, almost 50% are to REITs which typically have diversified underlying real estate
portfolios and the other 50% are to mostly stabilize properties with an average loan-to-value of 60%. And then,
just to touch on the residential mortgage portfolio, most of these loans are for Private Client Group clients across
the country. The average loan-to-value is only 64% and the average credit score is 762. So a really high-quality
portfolio.
So again, we feel good about our bank's portfolio. But with that being said, it's important to remember that we are
really experiencing unprecedented global economic disruption. So, as confident as we are about the composition
of the loan portfolio and our loan underwriting and monitoring processes, we also acknowledge that we could
experience significant credit deterioration due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The next slide details Raymond James Bank's energy exposure, which again only represents about 1.7% of total
loans, but $382 million of outstanding as of March 31. As you can see, there are no E&P loans in this portfolio as
the credit is mostly to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores. So, a little less direct commodity
pricing pressure, but again, if oil prices continue to decline, then all players in the supply chain could be negatively
impacted.

So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know if it's worth going through the opening again. I know [indiscernible] (00:22:44) call cut in, or just
should we skip it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
You can skip it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Okay. And for those who didn't hear the forward-looking statement, I know you can find it on our website. You
know it by heart anyway. So, thanks, Paul. I want to reiterate the first, our primary priority, our number one priority
is to ensure the health and safety of our associates, advisors and clients. While conditions may appear to have
improved in some parts of the world, we must be mindful we're still in the middle of a global health crisis.
Since the working from home arrangements worked so well, we continue to provide excellent services to our
clients. We have 95% of our associates are working from home and we've had no technology disruptions. So,
we've been able to service the work from home, which is a testament to our associates and their focus on client
service. And we're going to be very slow and deliberate of about bringing associates back into the office. And
when we believe that conditions are safe, we will slowly move them in in a phased, cautious manner.
For our near-term outlook, similar to the rest of the economy, I think you should expect significant near-term
headwinds for our business. In the Private Client Group segment, while our financial advisors recruiting pipelines
remain strong and we have ramped up virtual recruiting and onboarding activities, traditional recruiting efforts will
be impacted by the travel restrictions and even the comfort levels of in-person meetings. The near-term impact on
recruiting results is uncertain. And it seems likely that even with a strong pipeline, there will be delays and they
will be disrupted until restrictions are lifted, and people feel comfortable traveling and meeting in person again.
Meanwhile the segment is going to be negatively impacted by starting fiscal third quarter with a 14% sequential
decline of assets and fee-based accounts. Furthermore, results will also be negatively impacted by the yield of
third-party RJBDP balances, declining to around 30 basis points due to the rate cuts in March, which will only be
partially offset by higher cost â€“ client cash balances.
In Capital Markets segment, we have a pretty healthy investment banking pipeline, but we expect significant near-
term disruptions, certainly at least for the next couple of months. And while brokerage revenues surged along with
market volatility in March, volatility has declined thus far this quarter and we'd expect brokerage revenues to
decline as well following another spike in volatility which is certainly possible.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be negatively impacted by our lower financial assets under
management, as well as the net outflows from Carillon Tower Advisers. And at Raymond James Bank, we expect
NIM to decline somewhere around 3% in the fiscal second quarter, somewhere around 2.5% over the next quarter
or two, reflecting the Fed rate cuts in March and based on current LIBOR rates. Other than funding the corporate
revolver draws which have been slowed down significantly thus far in March, we have also made the decision to
9


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
suspend growing the corporate loan portfolio until we have more economic stability and clarity. But we will
continue in leveraging our balance sheet to support our Private Client Group clients with residential mortgages
and security-based loans.
We have a large bank loan provision this quarter and I know many will ask how much more do we expect. But
frankly, there is way too much uncertainties now at this point. Remember, we are only starting to see borrower
financials from March quarter, which still included two good months before March 5, and the pandemic really
showed up. We took as much provision as we could reasonably justify in the second quarter, but also expect to
take more going forward if the economy doesn't recover quickly. So, not a lot of great news over the short-term,
but I'm much more optimistic about our long-term outlook. As we all reminded in the latest â€“ in the last financial
crisis, after a battle of long-term outperformance in our industry is surviving periods of extreme stress.
As Paul detailed, we have a substantial amount of capital and liquidity. So, not only are we confident in our ability
to withstand a very severe economic downturn, we're also optimistic that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to
be opportunistic and front-footed when things stabilize. Our growth priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is
organic growth, primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the Private Client Group as well as
continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses, such as investment banking.
We also continue to pursue acquisitions which we will be well-positioned for as soon as an economic recovers
and market stabilize. Historically, these types of environments produce valuations that can be attractive to both
buyers and sellers over the long-term. A good example of that was our Morgan Keegan acquisition in 2012 after
the financial crisis.
Before we open the line for questions, I just want to add, while there are many uncertainties right now, I know
Raymond James will continue to operate in a manner consistent with our long-term values. These are the same
values that helped guide us and withstand past economic downturns, and deliver superior returns for
shareholders over time. It's difficult to predict the severity of the economic deterioration as a result of COVID -19, I
believe we are well-positioned with our diversified business mix, long-term focus and conservative principles.
With our strong capital and liquidity position, we can proactively pursue strategic acquisitions with a consistent
and disciplined approach. And while our strong capital position and systems infrastructure had been critical, our
successful response to the pandemic and resolving market disruptions is a testament to our people. I just want to
thank all of our associates and advisors again for the remarkable contributions and unwavering focus on serving
clients during this unprecedented crisis. I've never been more proud to be part of the Raymond James family.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Vincent and open the line for questions. Vincent?

Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Paul and Paul, hope you guys are doing well. Just, I appreciate it, some of the clarifying remarks on expense. And
you noted higher credit costs for the primary corporate of elevated non-comps versus expectations. I guess,
taking a step back, in our recent calls, you've talked about efforts to bend the cost curve, slow the pace of non-
comp growth, we started to see some early signs of that in recent quarters. But even when I back out the higher
provision and the NCI noise, it looks like core revenues were up about 5%, non-comps were up 7% sequentially.
I'm just trying to understand how much of the non-comp inflation was maybe one-time in nature; and then, with
revenue slated to contract from here just given the COVID pressures you cited, how should we think about the
pace of non-comp growth in a contracting revenue environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Steve, as you may recall from last quarter, the non-compensation number that you're basing the sequential
growth of last quarter of $299 million was kind of seasonally low. And so, we guided for the year to get to about
$1.3 billion or $325 million per quarter which would have been an increase of somewhere in the low single-digits
on apples-to-apples basis on an annual basis.
So everyone was sort of looking at that $325 million this quarter. And again, even with those two items you
mentioned, we would have been lower than that for the quarter. Now, again, a lot of that is due to some of the
conferences and travel. We actually had a conference â€“ an institutional conference we still had in early March
before the COVID crisis really broke out. But we did â€“ obviously travel expenses did decrease as March
progressed and the COVID shelter-in-place orders went into place. So â€“ and some of that was offset by
purchasing laptops, et cetera.
So I would tell you that the non-comp expenses, excluding the provisions, kind of came in in terms of the various
line items where we would have expected and where we talked about last quarter. Now, with that being said, as
we progress from here, the dynamics will shift a little bit as travel and conferences â€“ we've canceled a lot of the
conference â€“ the two big Private Client Group conferences this year. So that dynamic will shift from here.

And then, in terms of any further actions on cost beyond that, people and the compensation being our biggest
cost, it's really during the crisis is not when you make those types of changes. So, we need more clarity and
stability before we make broader changes in that.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thanks for the helpful color on that, Paul. And just one for me on credit and the provision outlook. Relative to a lot
of your bank comps, you've actually built a healthier level of provision despite having arguably lower exposure to
the higher risk industry categories. How should we think about the pace of provision build over the course of this
year? You've certainly alluded to GFC stress as maybe being the right paradigm here, but thinking about loan loss
reserve levels, should we infer that if COVID stress continues to negatively impact economic growth that we
should be contemplating similar build towards 2%-plus, or how should we really frame that as we think about the
trajectory over the remainder of this year?

[indiscernible] (00:32:31)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty going forward, as you've heard from all the other banks. And when
you look at that allowance for loan loss which, for us, is about 1.5% and you compare it to other banks, you really
have to look at the various loan categories. We don't have a credit card portfolio, for example. Some of the banks
put allowances of 8% to 10% on those type of portfolios.
But within our corporate and CRE portfolio, around 2.4% allowance for loan losses, which we believe that based
on what we see in the industry is a healthy number. And so â€“ but going forward, as healthy as we think that is, it
could get worse from here, if the economic conditions are â€“ continue to be â€“ continue to deteriorate, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. And just one quick clarifying question. Paul, I believe that you indicated that the third-party sweep program
is yielding about 30 bps, I was just hoping you could speak to how these agreements are structured given a lot of
banks are flushed with cash, giving client de-risking and aggressive QE. I'm just wondering if the banks start to
have less appetite for deposits or if you're sensing that at all, and how that might impact pricing on some of these
agreements?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I'll tell you, early on, last month or so, we've actually seen just the opposite. The demand from the banks and even
some of the biggest banks in the country has been very strong. I think some of that is somewhat related to the
significant levels of revolver fundings over the last month. And so, we've added significant capacity with third-party
banks at attractive rates. And they're typically one or two year type agreements. And for us, as of right now, their
floating rate agreements that are based off of Fed Funds target or Fed Funds effect.

your question.

Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, guys. Another one on the provision. I appreciate there's a lot of uncertainty. But can you talk to us a bit
about the potential ramifications or impacts to you from the implementation of CECL in October?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I guess, too early to tell. We're building out all of the models. And even when we run sort of parallel runs
now with the models that we have, there's pretty significant variations especially since the COVID crisis and what
macroeconomic scenarios we could use. We would probably err on using some of the more conservative
scenarios. But again, too early to tell. And by the time we implement it on October 1, conditions and assumptions
are going to be a lot different. So even for the banks that have already implemented CECL, what we're hearing on
from peers and other earnings calls is that there's a lot of uncertainty and variability with the assumptions that
they're using.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I know you guys are sweeping lot of deposits to third-party banks. But what is your appetite to grow the
securities portfolio in this type of an environment with where yields are today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. We said on the last few calls, we have a target to grow the securities portfolio to $6 billion by the end of the
fiscal year. We actually ended the quarter at just over $4 billion. So that would represent a 15% increase which is
a significant increase for the rest of the fiscal year, and we'll probably get to the $6 billion at the current pace,
maybe a few weeks before the end of the fiscal year. But obviously a lot can change between now and then.
In terms of the incremental balances that came in in the last four weeks, we're taking them off balance sheet now
just to provide as much flexibility as possible. We wouldn't want to make a big change in our balance sheet
strategy in the middle of a global pandemic, and so â€“ and certainly not with all the cash that just came in in the
last three to four weeks. So we're open to it. Last time we were in a zero rate environment, we didn't have a
securities portfolio or agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio at all. Now, we do, and we have a lot of
expertise, we actually use our in-house team the â€“ a strategic investment management services team to help us
with it. So we feel really good about our securities portfolio. And in that, the cash balances remain resilient as we
get through the $6 billion that still makes sense for us and for shareholders who certainly consider growing it even
beyond that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Good. I guess, first question just on the NIM guidance in the bank. I appreciate the color there, that's roughly what
we were expecting in terms of the progression. As we think about kind of beyond the next couple quarters, do you
see that moving lower, further from there, just based on the current rate curve or how should we think about that,
the 2.5% is kind of where effectively in that range it bottoms out, or are there other kind of puts and takes that
would affect if we were to kind of run this out a little further next year or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, obviously, there's going to be a lot of variables there in terms of how the asset growth, in which
categories that asset growth comes from within the next year or two. So, as best as we can tell right now, 2.5%
give or take, obviously, like were moved 20 basis points just in the last 7 days. So, there's a lot of volatility even in
the base rate. But I think, based on what we know about now, that's about as far as we're willing to go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Paul. And then, a follow-up here just on â€“ we talked a little bit about M&A and the
opportunities that can come about as a result of dislocation. And as I just think about tying that into the technology
investment that the firm has made in recent years and kind of how that differentiates you or when you even think
about talking to financial advisors in recruiting and just in this work-from-home environment, how much more
important technology is today probably than ever before?
How is that playing into kind of the offering to advisors as you're doing these virtual recruiting sessions with them
and just kind of essentially presenting the platform to them?
And then, in terms of the M&A consolidation opportunity, is that maybe one of the drivers here where some of the
firms that are small or maybe under-invested and we're seeing the technology is going to be probably a lot more
important than even anyone thought six months ago or a year ago? So just love some thoughts on that both how
it applies to both recruiting and M&A as well.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
So, for recruiting, Steve â€“ sorry, Devin, that it's early. We've had a few, what I call, teller recruiting sessions that
have worked. Our commitment backlog is good, but the joining dates have slipped, if you don't want to go in and
open an office right now, in most cases, although we've had some virtual openings. So it's early to tell really what
that impact is going to be in terms of recruiting.
There's nothing like a face-to-face meeting, especially when many people are joining us for a value proposition
and to really see the technology demonstrated by â€“ with people. It's much more impactful. So, I think getting in
front of people will be the key to resuming recruiting at the kind of the paces we have. So, my guess is, it will be
disrupted.
In terms of â€“ for the financial services [indiscernible] (00:40:16) for advisers, most firms did fairly well in terms of
work-from-home, their technology may not have been as notable, but they've been able to do that. And financially,
self-clearing firms probably struggled without a â€“ if they didn't have a lot of capital in first week or two, but that's
settled down too.
So, I think it's going to be a little bit longer-term, where people have to see that strategically as we recruit because
of our systems, I think firms are going to have to say, you know what, we're just too far behind between regulatory
and recruiting and technology that we need to go somewhere else. So, I wouldn't expect in the Private Client
Group space any rapid movement. And we wish those firms well. They're friendly firms to us, but hopefully,
someday they make a decision, they'll join us.
I think there's probably more opportunity if this crisis â€“ if there's a slow return in M&A. We've had discussions in
the investment banking and then M&A space for a while now, and pricing tended to be the issue, and we'll see
what happens to pricing [indiscernible] (00:41:21), I think people will get more interested. If it's short-term and
M&A bounces back, then I think there'll be less opportunity. So we're very actively keeping up the dialogue and
we're just going to have to see. Again, just like the crisis, it's too early to tell a slow recovery will need more
probably reserves and a slower market and â€“ but maybe more M&A opportunity and a faster recovery may make
the loan portfolio much more robust and the market goes up with maybe M&A opportunities won't be as available,
so it's just too hard to tell. It seems like forever. But we're six weeks in really, so it's â€“ being economists, we count
the days a little, they seem a little slower, but didn't had a lot of time where we are in this pandemic so far.

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey. How are you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gautam Sawant Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
My question â€“ doing well. What's your decision to raise an additional $500 million and how do you feel about your
liquidity and capital position with $2 billion of cash at the parent level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
What drove it was honestly we debated with about a day-and-a-half dollar cash revolver that's secured and
committed by we think some of the biggest and healthiest finical institutions that we really need cash. And the first
answer was probably not. But we decided to â€“ I've never seen a firm go broke as they have much cash or a firm
that they couldn't execute an opportunity because they have too much cash. So we looked at the pros and cons
and decided that our extreme capital levels that we've had or [indiscernible] (00:43:20).
So, now we're $2 billion in cash in a $0.5 billion undrawn line of credit. So we feel we did it. If this crisis is more
severe, then we imagine we'll still be fine. We're multiples of the cash and capital that we had going into the 2009
crisis â€“ 2008-2009. If there's a acquisition opportunity, we are ready to go. Part of our Morgan Keegan acquisition
happened because we were able to execute both with our cash on hand and in an overnight committed line that
[indiscernible] (00:44:00) will execute very quickly at a time where it was very uncertain, you can execute. So,
again we felt being liquid was probably more important than the extra interest cost. So we went ahead and just
found an offering.

Please ask your question.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Couple questions. So, I guess, just going back to credit dynamics and the
provision in the quarter, can you help us understand, I guess, some of the macro ramparts that you considered
whether it's GDP growth or something that we can help sensitize to what degree if we see further deterioration of
portfolio or an economy we could see additional reserve builds, or kind of what's the baseline assumption and any
sensitivity around additional deterioration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We don't implement CECL until October 1, so it's not so formulaic for us yet because we have a September 30
fiscal year-end. So our CECL implantation starts at the beginning of our next fiscal year. So it's not quite as
formulaic, we're still under the incurred loss model where we're really trying to go loan by loan and do â€“ make the
decision on a bottoms-up basis.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I know those reserves were generated mainly on the industries that we thought in sectors that were very COVID-
affected, so that's where most of that â€“ all that reserve been came from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. And then, I guess, unrelated just back to the conversation around expenses and comp. Appreciate your
comments around the comp rate obviously been skewed this quarter by the private equity dynamic, that's pretty
clear. But, I guess, if you look at some of the segments, the comp rate in Capital Markets specifically picked up
pretty materially at around 63% in the quarter. So, I guess, maybe you drove that and then taking a step back,
can you help us think about what the comp rate for the firm should look like for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Within the Capital Markets segment, that comp ratio was negatively impacted this quarter by a revenue
mix. And we don't break it out anymore after revenue recognition changes last year. But we did have some
trading losses on inventories in the Capital Markets segment, whether it's not the same direct compensation
associated with those trading losses as we have with the significant growth and commissions we had in the
segment during the quarter. And, of course, on a year-over-year basis, M&A was down significantly from a very
strong year-ago quarter. So it's really attributable to the revenue mix and particularly the trading losses on the
inventories.
In aggregate, though, kind of stepping back, answering the overall question, obviously, there's going to be
negative pressure or upward pressure on the comp ratio just due to lower interest rates and the negative impact
that lower interest rates has on non-compensable revenues, the net interest income and RJBDP from third-party
banks are going to be down based on the guidance that we just provided and those don't have direct
compensation associated with it. So you can look back and forth the 2015 period, in a zero rate environment,
obviously, that puts upward pressure on our comp ratio, but we're not â€“ because of all the volatility with the other
line items and the impact of revenue mix, we're not in a position now to provide a new target for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think, too, it's important to note that those trading losses, a lot of them were generated by fixed income. In our
unique kind of balance sheet, one of our strongest sectors has been in the non-taxable [indiscernible] (00:47:34)
finance. And even though that portfolio was almost entirely investment graded, in 2009 those securities traded
well; in this downturn, they did not. So, we went ahead and lowered those. I think we have the lowest inventory
we've ever had. And fixed income, right now, went ahead and sold them out and that generated some trading
losses, but it's left with [indiscernible] (00:47:58) liquid nimble.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That kind of makes sense. Can I just squeeze in one more around just the capital return dynamics
and the balance sheet management? So, obviously, nice to see you guys do a successful debt offering. But just
given the significant model liquidity on the balance sheet, can you give us some thoughts around kind of rationale
behind going out and raising long-term debt today that for â€“ and your refi activity or anything else we should be
thinking about there? Thanks.

I think if you look at our capital, one of our clear messages, we have a lot more capital and cash. Even today,
we're very unlevered compared to most of our competitors. So, one of the challenges we had even if, let's say,
the world continued and we're buying back stock, we were to â€“ had to raise that for liquidity. Europe, we did an
acquisition. We would have to raise debt or equity for liquidity. So, I think what you see is us just being a little
more aggressive than getting our cash liquidity more in line with our capital, so that we have flexibility.
And we felt the market has a recovered and is starting to do better. But we've also seen periods where the market
wasn't open for periods of time and felt that even at that cost, it was a good trade-off to have more liquidity, more
in keeping with the capital we have to give us flexibility whether we end up doing an acquisition or buying back
shares eventually where have a cash to build and execute on that.

Q
Hi. This is actually [ph] Lilly (00:49:34) dialing in for Bill Katz. So, thank you so much for taking this question, and
hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. So, just have questions round Capital Markets. I'm wondering what
are the current equity and fixed income sell-side trends into April and what would be the key factors to get M&A
going in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think for M&A in Capital Markets, it's just confidence where the economy is going. So, surprisingly [indiscernible]
(00:50:05) backlog has been very resilient and people are still talking or waiting. I think if you see an economic
recovery start to happen, then the transactions will pick up. If you see a very slow recovery or a recurrence of
virus, you're going to see M&A activity really fall off. So, again, it's very economic-dependent.
And in fixed income, I think it preserve â€“ we did very well. We'll get our trading losses, as I described, later, but
the volume and the profitability of that segment has been good. Certainly March, from a commission basis, was
outsized for everybody with the increased volatility. But even as volatility settled down, we still have reasonably
good volumes in our fixed income trading sales business. So feeling pretty good about that sector.
