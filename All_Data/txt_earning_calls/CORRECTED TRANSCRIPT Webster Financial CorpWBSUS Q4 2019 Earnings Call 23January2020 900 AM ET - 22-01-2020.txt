Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Webster's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. CFO
Glenn MacInnes and I will review business and financial performance for the quarter. HSA Bank President Chad
Wilkins is here with us in Waterbury and will be available during Q&A.
I'll begin my comments on slide 2. Webster's fourth quarter results demonstrate our ongoing commitment to
strong execution on our strategic priorities. Earnings per share were $0.96 in Q4. This compares to $1.01 in both
Q3 and Q4 of 2018 when each period is adjusted for one-time items. The decline resulted from a reduced level of
net interest income relative to each prior period, primarily driven by the full impact of three Fed interest cut rates
during the second half of 2019, a lower-than-expected LIBOR rate in Q4 and a mix shift in the loan portfolio to
lower yielding, high-quality CRE loans.
Assuming no further Fed action in 2020, our net interest income is expected to grow beginning in Q1 and
continuing throughout the year. We anticipate full year 2020 net interest income will meet or exceed the $955
million generated in 2019 based upon our current asset growth forecast. All other metrics in the quarter were
favorable. Loan growth was strong, as commercial loans grew 10% from a year ago or by more than $1.1 billion.
Total footings at HSA Bank increased 18% from a year ago for growth of almost $1.3 billion during the year.
Disciplined expense control resulted in flat linked quarter noninterest expense, and credit metrics remained
remarkably strong contributing to our lowest quarterly provision in more than seven years. In Q4, nonperforming
loans, net charge-offs and classified assets were all lower as a percentage of total loans when compared to both
the prior quarter and the prior year. The overall portfolio weighted average risk rating improved as well. Tangible
book value now exceeds $2.5 billion and increased 15% from the end of 2018. Tangible book value per share is
also 15% higher than last year.
Glenn will dive deeper into the quarter, but I'd like to make a few comments related to full year 2019 performance.
I'm on slide 3. Reported PPNR totaled almost $525 million and increased 8% from 2018. This was driven by
positive operating leverage, as revenue grew more than 4% while expenses increased only 1.5%. Despite the
lower interest rate environment in the second half of the year, the net interest margin for full year 2019 was 3.55%
compared to 3.6% in 2018.
The efficiency ratio for the full year improved one full point to 56.8% and the provision totaled $38 million and was
at its lowest annual level since 2014. Our performance resulted in a full year return on common equity of 12.8%
and a return on tangible common equity of 16%. The net result was full year EPS of $4.06, up 6.5% from 2018.
This represents our 10th consecutive full year of EPS growth, which puts us in select company within the banking
industry. Also, full year common dividend of $1.53 per share increased 22% from 2018.
Slide 4 highlights the strength of our loan and deposit performance since the end of 2017. A little over $2.5 billion
of loan growth has been accompanied by more than $2.3 billion of deposit growth. Our loan to deposit ratio of
86% continues to provide us with significant flexibility. We believe that our ability to consistently generate organic
loan and deposit growth year-in and year-out is a differentiator. Our five-year loan and deposit growth CAGRs
were both around 8%.
Turning to slide 5, I'll comment briefly on our lines of business. Commercial Banking's loan portfolio has increased
more than $1 billion over the past year for end of period growth of 10%, and deposits were also up 8.7% in that
business line. HSA Bank opened 744,000 new accounts in 2019, representing its third consecutive year with

production above 700,000 accounts. Community Banking's loans and deposits each grew by approximately 6%
from a year ago with continued strength in Business Banking and Mortgage Banking.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll begin on our average balance sheet on slide 6. Average loans grew $335 million or 1.7% linked
quarter. Growth continues to be led by the commercial business. In the quarter, we had significant growth in
commercial real estate, which increased $355 million versus the third quarter and more than $800 million from a
year ago. Commercial loans now represent 64% of total loans compared to 63% in prior year. Consumer loan
performance was led by growth in residential mortgages with some offset from continued reduction in home
equity.
Versus prior year, our $1.4 billion of total loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth. Combined low cost
transactional and HSA deposits have increased more than $1 billion from last year and now represent 58% of
total deposits. Their combined cost was 13 basis points in Q4 and 12 basis points in prior year. The Q1 seasonal
inflow of HSA and public funds deposits will fund loan growth and reduce short-term borrowings.
Slide 7 summarizes our Q4 income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings. Net interest income was $9
million lower than prior quarter. This was primarily due to a 38 basis point reduction in average one-month LIBOR
contributing to a reduction in interest income of $18 million. This was partially offset by lower deposit cost of $3
million reflecting a reduction of 5 basis points.
And we also realized the benefit of $6 million from loan and security balanced growth. Likewise, net interest
margin was 22 basis points lower than Q3. The drop in loan yields reduced NIM by 23 basis points, which was
primarily driven by lower LIBOR rates. Growth in loan and securities also compressed NIM another 6 basis points.
This was partially offset by 7 basis points due to reduction in rate on deposits and borrowings.
Net interest income in Q4 was about $5 million lower than our outlook, and NIM was about 8 basis points lower.
This was primarily the result of lower deferred fees from prepayments, the timing on deposit rate reductions,
which came in 2 basis points higher than our forecast, and the mix shift from C&I to commercial real estate and
lower than expected LIBOR rates. Versus prior year, net interest income declined $6 million. $21 million of the
decline was due to lower rates with a partial offset of $16 million from additional volume. Asset sensitivity has
been reduced over the past year. Under a short end down 50 basis points scenario, our PPNR would be lower by
3.8%. This compares to 4.4% at the end of Q3 and 5.4% a year ago.
Noninterest income increased $1 million linked quarter and decreased $2 million from prior year. The linked
quarter increase primarily reflects a higher level of revenue from client hedging activities. The decrease from Q4
of 2018 reflects a $4.6 million gain on the sale of banking centers in that period. Reported noninterest expense of
a little under $180 million was flat linked quarter and up $5 million year-over-year. Pre-provision net revenue of
$122 million declined $8 million from Q3 and $13 million from prior year. Loan loss provision for the quarter was
$6 million and essentially matched net charge-offs.
The efficiency ratio was 58.5%. The increase from Q3 and a year ago were driven by lower net interest income
and partially offset by continued expense discipline. Our effective tax rate was 22.3% up from 21.3% in Q3. The
increase was due to a discrete tax expense associated with the state and local tax position recognized in Q4.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Beginning with slide 8, I'll highlight the line of business results. Commercial Banking loan growth was led by
investor commercial real estate, which grew 12% linked quarter and 23% versus prior year. C&I balances were
flat linked quarter with fundings offset by payoffs, but grew 5% versus prior year. Net interest income grew $1.1
million from last year primarily reflecting average loan growth of $926 million or 9%. This was partially offset by
lower loan spreads driven by mix and a lower credit on deposits. Noninterest income and noninterest expense
were essentially flat from prior year. Combined ongoing loan growth resulted in a 2% increase in PPNR versus
prior year.
Slide 9 highlights HSA Bank, which delivered a solid quarter led by the production of 126,000 new accounts. Our
3 million accounts have $8.5 billion of total footings. Footings were $1.3 billion or 18% higher than prior year while
accounts were 9% higher. Net interest income was 6% higher from prior year reflecting growth of 12% in average
deposits and the impact of our lower net credit rate. The cost of deposits was 20 basis points and has remained
flat for 12 quarters. Noninterest income increased 6% from prior year driven by an 11% increase in interchange
revenue and flat account fees, primarily due to a reduction in statement fees as we move the account holders to
e-statements. Total revenue for the quarter grew 6% from a year ago while expenses increased 12% resulting in
flat pre-tax net revenue. January month-to-date deposits are up approximately $400 million from year end with
new accounts tracking to last year's levels.
Slide 10 highlights Community Banking. Total loans grew by over 6% year-over-year with growth coming equally
from Business Banking and Personal Banking. Business and consumer deposits grew 10% and 4%, resulting in
overall deposit growth of nearly 6% from prior year. Net interest income was adversely impacted by the declining
rate environment. Adjusting for a $4.6 million one-time gain on the sale of six banking centers in the fourth quarter
of 2018, noninterest income increased 5% year-over-year led by higher mortgage banking revenue. Expenses
grew by less than 1%, as investments in technology and people were offset by efficiencies in other areas.
Side 11 highlights our key asset quality metrics. Non-performing loans in the upper left declined $12 million from
Q3. Asset-based lending represented $9 million of the decrease. Net charge-offs in the upper right declined $7.7
million from Q3 and totaled $6.1 million in the quarter. Commercial classified loans in the lower left decreased
modestly and now represent 260 basis points of total commercial loans. This compares to a 20-quarter average of
317 basis points.
Our allowance for loan loss remained at $209 million with the provision of $6 million and a coverage ratio of 104
basis points. The $6 million provision reflects the strong credit profile, which John outlined. We're on track with our
CECL adoption which will be recorded on our balance sheet effective January 1. We expect the day one impact to
increase our current allowance by approximately 30%, in line with the range disclosed last quarter. The impact will
be recorded as a charge to capital and will reduce common equity Tier 1 capital between 20 and 25 basis points,
but increase total risk-based capital by about 5 basis points. Regarding the day two impact, our quarterly CECL
allowance will be based on loan growth and mix, asset quality and the macroeconomic environment. Given stable
metrics, we'd expect our allowance coverage ratio to remain around 30 basis points higher than Q4's level.
Slide 12 provides our outlook for Q1 compared to Q4. We expect average loans to increase 1% to 2% driven
primarily by commercial real estate and residential loans. We expect average interest-earning assets to grow
around 1%. We expect net interest margin to increase up to 3 basis points assuming stable market rates. As a
result, we expect net interest income to increase $2 million to $4 million. Noninterest income is likely to increase
$1 million to $3 million. We expect our efficiency ratio to be in the range of 58%, and our provision for loan and
lease loss under CECL will be driven by loan composition and forecasted economic conditions. We expect the tax
rate on a non-FTE basis to be approximately 22% to 23%. And lastly, excluding any share buybacks, we expect
our average diluted share count to be approximately 92 million shares.

John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. Webster enters this new decade and our 85th year from a position of strength based on our
efforts and accomplishments in the decade just ended. We will continue to focus on executing against our
strategic priorities always with a long-term view of maximizing economic profits and continuing to build franchise
value. We're fortunate to be guided in our strategic direction by an accomplished board of directors. I'm pleased to
cite four of Webster's board members, Liz Flynn, Carol Hayles, Karen Osar and Lauren States for their recent
recognition among Women Inc.'s 2019 Most Influential Corporate Board Directors. As always, I'd like to
acknowledge our 3,400 values-based bankers for their outstanding contributions and their unwavering
commitment to our customers, our communities and to each other.
And finally, before we open it up for questions, I'd like to take a minute to comment on the announcement we
made this morning that consistent with our well-planned, multi-year transition, Jim Smith had announced that he
will be retiring from Webster's board of directors effective at our April Annual Shareholders Meeting, at which time
I will become Chairman of the board. On behalf of our board of directors and all Webster bankers, I'd like to again
acknowledge and thank Jim for his incredible contributions to Webster and the communities we serve over his
distinguished 44-year career. I'd also like to thank him personally for his guidance, support and friendship during
my time at Webster and particularly during the period of transition. He is truly a remarkable person.
With that, Michelle, I'm happy to open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
To start, first looking at the guidance on NIM, the up 1 to 3 basis points in 1Q 2020 is a very favorable trend. For
Glenn, what are you seeing that leads you to think NIM will expand in the first quarter?

Glenn I. MacInnes A

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
So part of that, Steve, is the inflow of both HSA and public funds which will allow us to pay down some FHLB
borrowings. So that'll help NIM. And then we also have CD maturities and promotional savings repricing which will
also be favorable, both net interest income and NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then once we get beyond the first quarter, Glenn, how are you thinking about NIM for the rest of 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So it's sort of flattish for the next couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Got you. And then – thank you – for Chad on HSA Bank, can you talk about how the enrollment season
went for HSA and how you're feeling about 1Q 2020 account and deposit growth based on what you saw?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. Steve, it's John and I'll let Chad obviously provide some color. Obviously, we say the same thing at this time
of the year which is it's too early to make a firm call but the guidance we'll provide is kind of to-date in January,
we're tracking really almost on top of the ranges we had last year, both in inflow of deposits and new account
openings. So if you think of those numbers, that's about $400 million in new deposits and in the ballpark of
250,000 accounts. So we're tracking kind of where we were last year, and obviously, we'll be able to give you a
much better indication at the next earnings call when the enrollment period wraps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add, John, is that we continue to see the strongest performance in the channels where
we have the most influence on growth activities and we're going to have the [indiscernible] (00:19:00) study
coming out between now and the end of the first quarter and we'll have full results to report on when we get there
as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And one comment I'll make, Steve, maybe to anticipate other questions on the call too, there was no impact in Q4
of any of the account movements that we talked about in Q3. So we didn't receive any compensation from some
of those accounts leaving and none of those accounts left during the quarter. So fourth quarter was not impacted
by the information we guided the group to in Q3.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then – thank you. And then the final question. So if we look at full year loan and deposit growth for
2019, they were each running above the two-year CAGR. Do you think that you can continue pacing above that
historical CAGR in 2020? Thanks.

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
So you may have noticed, I said in the beginning of my remarks which was an important point I wanted to make
that I thought we would meet or exceed our total net interest income for the year based on our current asset
growth forecast, and I think that's a great question. Right now, our loan growth forecast is slightly below what we
did between 2018 and 2019. So I think we're relatively confident we can keep running at that relative pace, maybe
slightly below on loans. And when you factor in growth in the securities portfolio, we don't think that our asset
growth metrics or aspirations are too aggressive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. Before I sign off, John, congratulations on the Chairman role and best of luck to Jim Smith in
retirement. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My first question just is around the growth that you saw this quarter and how
you guys are sort of seeing that trend in 2020 because obviously, as you guys indicated, the mix this quarter of
higher CRE versus C&I impacted the NIM. So, number one, just where did the extraordinary growth from CRE
come from? And then maybe just some commentary on as how you see that playing out in 2020 and then also
maybe just some of the dynamics within C&I as to why that growth didn't necessarily materialize, perhaps to what
you were thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Happy to do that, Collyn, and thanks for the question. Yeah, it's an interesting underlying story. I always talk
about the fact that we've got these great – this diverse source of loan growth, right, both geographically in product
set and in business line. And I wish I could say that we could just simply pull levers and have growth in certain
areas. And so I think this quarter just happened to be a quarter of light pay-offs in commercial real estate. I'll
provide some detail on that because I think it's also important to know that we're not sort of being too aggressive
in any one area.
We had extraordinary growth in our investor commercial CRE book, but that was on about $375 million in new
fundings. That compares to $360 million in new fundings fourth quarter of last year. So, really, our origination
levels were not materially higher. The difference in the story in CRE was we had $132 million in payoffs this Q4 as
opposed to $290 million in payoffs the year before. There doesn't seem to be a trend line or any dynamics that
are driving that, but I think it's an important point to make that we didn't have outsized CRE originations. We had
significantly lower CRE payoffs.
8


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
And the story is similar in C&I in sponsor and specialty business for instance which, you know, has been a big
driver of high-yielding loan growth for us. We had originations of something like $240 million in Q4 as opposed to
around $200 million last Q4, but we had $296 million, almost $300 million in payoffs in that sponsor and specialty
business, resulting in an actual decline in the second half of the year. So it's really a payoff story more than
outsized originations, and as you heard me talk about, the net result is a slightly lower yield on the loans and a
slight improvement in weighted average risk rating and credit quality in the portfolio. So I think you'll see more of
that going forward. You'll see a different mix in different quarters just depending on – with our, I think, disciplined
credit choices, where we have opportunities across our footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Do you have a sense of – or maybe as you – within the guidance that you're offering, what you think pay-
downs will do this year, I mean do you think they'll slow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
We don't. I think if you looked at our expectations again and it's hard to predict in the various categories, I think
we anticipate similar origination volumes and similar pay-down metrics. Obviously, that could change quarter to
quarter. But if we look back over history, if you look at it on kind of a trailing four-quarter basis, you get a pretty
good sense. So the short answer to your question is we are not anticipating some sort of macro change that
would either lower prepays or drive them higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then Glenn, just on the comment on the timing on pushing through
some of these lower deposit costs in the first quarter. Yeah. Just curious kind of where your head is and how
you're pricing some of your CD rates now and just how aggressive you think you could be on some of those,
assuming – I know all your guidance assumes no more Fed cuts, so just kind of getting a sense of where you
think ultimately some of those deposit costs can go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So If I look at total deposit costs for Q4, I think we're somewhere around 54 basis points. We think on average in
the first quarter, that could drop down to 47 basis points. And a lot of that is, like I indicated, shortening the term of
CDs which also helps our asset sensitivity, but it's also pointing back on some of the promotional rights that we
have out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Just sort of for context, our seven-month CDs at [ph] 1.60 and we have a savings promotion that's out there at
1.80 (00:25:10) right now.

Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thank you for that. And then Chad, a question for you, an obvious question that maybe you don't
necessary want to hear but – so when we talk about HSA and, John, you'd indicated that kind of you're tracking
similar to where you guys tracked in 2019, I guess the simple question is why is growth not higher. Given all that
you've done, all the investments you've made within the sales force and infrastructure, just curious as to why
growth isn't coming on higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Collyn, in 2019, we actually saw higher growth rates in our new accounts with new employers, so a little bit
lower with our existing employers. And as you know, a large portion of our new accounts come from existing
employers. So it's really was enrollment based. And there is a lot of factors that impact enrollments in health plans
and consequently in HSAs. I do believe we have the opportunity to influence that to a greater extent as we go into
2020. We've conducted a lot of pilots and programs in 2019 that were targeted at providing decision support tools
and programs to our employers which showed really positive results in terms of both penetration and deposit
rates with customers. So we're looking to accelerate that as we go into 2020. But again, a lot depends on the
macro environment and how that influences enrollments as well.

First question, I'm curious, John, could you give us a little update on sort of how things are going in Boston and
also help us maybe size your business these days in Philadelphia and DC markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Boston continues to track. We've made no secret that it's probably the most competitive market we
have with respect to cost of customer acquisition and deposit pricing and that really hasn't abated much, and
you've all read that JPMorgan is there as well, which continues to make the market competitive. We continue to
make progress. I think we're on track to hit our goal in terms of asset growth in loans and deposits. And again, it's
been probably more costly than the rest of our footprint. We are path breakeven for a year now. I think we had
about $700,000 in just retail bank contribution there, which we try and track to be honest with ourselves and
honest with you. Obviously, our profitability in the market, overall market, is pretty strong because that's really the
epicenter of our sponsor in specialty business, a lot of our sponsor relationships. We've got a great commercial
real estate book there, a couple of billion dollars in loan.
So, we're happy with where the market is. We continually need to reduce square footage. Our banking centers,
they are big and they don't need to be that big. So we're making some progress on that front. But all in all, we
think it's a critical market, it's a fast growing market. There are more cranes in the sky in that city than you could
imagine. And so we do think that our physical presence there and our retail presence there helps our wealth
management and all of our Commercial Banking. So I would say good, not over-performing and not
underperforming, kind of right on our expectations.
With respect to the other markets, Mark, in obviously growing any retail footprint in those other markets in
Philadelphia or in DC, we've got good traction. We've been in the Philadelphia market from a commercial real
estate perspective for over 10 years now. We've had a lot of growth in that market. Our total loans in Philadelphia
in the South Jersey, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area approached $2 billion, excellent asset quality, full
relationships with middle market customers. The vast majority of those outstandings are commercial real estate
and we have ABL there. So, again, you've heard our philosophy. We don't look at it as a loan production office.
We look at it as a core market. We expect cash management and other relationships with our borrowers there.
And we're okay with growing at a modest pace because we don't want to be the lender of last resort. And I'd say
DC which is not as critical to us right now, we've got asset based lending in commercial real estate, but we're
talking a couple of hundred million dollars in exposure there. And it hasn't been really a significant growth market
for us recently.

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No. Look, obviously, there is a lot more chatter and there are some compelling reasons I think why banks are
choosing to gain scale. We think gaining scale over time is important. We really haven't shifted our focus or made
a significant pivot in that regard. Obviously, as I said, there is a lot more discussions. CEOs are talking with each
other. There are compelling reasons both from a technology investment perspective, higher capital scale, access
to data, all the reasons why it's better. We were three times the size, we've probably spent the same amount on
AML, BSA as we do now. So I understand the compelling rationale. We would never say never, but we are very
much focused on continuing to grow and exploit our differentiated capabilities. But I'll leave it at that to say we're
not focused on M&A as a primary strategic goal right now, but we would never say never.

Please proceed with your question.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions for you. So, first on expenses, I was just curious, is there anything on the
expense front you could do to offset some of the recent NIM pressure as we look to 2020. And the reason I ask, it
looks like – based on the efficiency guidance of 58%, looks like some of the operating leverage could reverse a
little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
David, great question. I'll let Glenn provide some fuller context and I think it's the appropriate question to ask. I
think we've demonstrated to the market over a sustained period of time that we have good expense discipline and
expense control. We have not been aspirational about really aggressively reducing expenses, because we've
talked about how important it is to continue to invest in our organic growth in our differentiated businesses,
particularly in commercial and HSA. And we've done that and I think it will stead us well over the long term.
The short answer is yes, we have opportunities and we're working on many of them right now. Business process
automation in the middle and back office, we've got a lot of things rolling there. We have fewer people in
operations this year than we did last year and will continue that trend. So, we think we can really start to bend the
curve with the use of technology, automation, middle office efficiency. And so, yes, we do have tools available to
us and not all of that is layered in our forward forecast. We want to make sure that we're not hurting our organic
growth and our long-term franchise build, but we do have levers to pull with respect to expense control.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No – I would just – so, you have to keep in mind the first quarter has a couple things. You have the higher
FICO costs, which somewhat offset some of the medical costs and there's some ins and outs there, Dave, but to
John's point, I think we have opportunity both in the middle and back office as well as optimizing as we continue
to do the community bank.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And then shifting to the NII and some of the NIM commentary. Well, on the leverage
strategy that you guys kind of spoke about last quarter where you had purchased – I think it was about $640
million of securities funded by FHLB borrowings. Do you plan to unwind that with the deposit inflows in the first
quarter or conversely, do you plan to add to that leverage strategy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No. So I can tell we're likely not unwinding it. And that if you look at our earning asset growth in John's earlier
comments, you have both loan growth and proportionate security growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. And then the last one for...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No. I'm sorry, David, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So then just continuing with the discussion on NIM, so your interest rate sensitivity, you mentioned about how it
was reduced this quarter. How low would you like to take that interest rate sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So we'd like to move closer to neutral. I think the only caveat to that is we want to preserve some of the upside as
well. So I think if you look in our slide deck back on page 20, you can see the progress we've made particularly in
the short end down scenario, on the falling rate scenario, you can see the progress. So part of adding investment
securities, part of the balance sheet positioning we did in the second and third quarter certainly helped that. Also
the fact that we have absorbed three Fed cuts as well and if you look out at least as far as we're looking at, more
stability in both Fed funds, one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR, which will sort of keep that sort of
13

constant. And then actions we take on top of that whether it's adding more fixed rate assets in the form of
residential or equipment finance, investment securities portfolio or shortening as we have, our borrowings and
some of the CD promotions and things like that will have a positive impact going forward.

Jared Shaw Q

Hi. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just also wanted to give my congratulations to you, John, and Jim for a great career. And as a Connecticut
resident, I certainly hope Jim stays fully engaged in the opportunities to help improve the financial situation and
fiscal situation here in the state.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Jared, thanks for that comment and I think I can – even though Jim's not here – I can tell you and rest assured
that he will continue to be involved in policy around the state.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's great to hear. Maybe just circling back on the HSA and Chad or John, any of the – have you noticed any of
the rhetoric around the political environment right now in Medicare for all, impacting any of the employer's
decisions to adopt a high deductible healthcare plan or is that really not flowing into their sort of internal HR
discussions at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
It's interesting. So some of what I'll tell you is speculation and other is obviously what we know. I think on a macro
level, obviously, the chances of full Medicare for all single payer seem to have gone down with changes in the
14


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
various polls and that rhetoric seems to have gone away a little bit. And we think – as we've said, we've always
been confident that given our current healthcare system that that wasn't a real risk in the short term. There has
been more discussion in various state capitals around high deductible health plans and so on and so forth. We
actually don't think that that is the dialog that could be driving maybe lower adaptability.
As we've said all along, we think that there is a bit of a compression across the industry based on a 3.5% or 3.4%
unemployment rate where – when companies are having to be more and more aggressive in competing for talent
that they are optically trying to provide richer, more fuller benefits and that that may have slowed the whole
industry down over the last couple of years as you've seen. We are not seeing – and I'll let Chad put a finer point
on it – sort of a dialog around the virtuous nature, or lack thereof, of high deductible health plans actually
impacting employers' decisions not to offer them or encourage their employers to adopt them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I totally agree, John. That was spot on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then capital management, I hear what you said around M&A and focusing organically,
but when you look at capital, you continue to build it here. It looks like that's going to continue as we go forward.
Outside of M&A, should we expect to see Webster be more active in trying to either, through the dividend or
through a buyback again, return more capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, good question. I'll be really transparent here again. So, obviously, our primary desire is to use capital to
grow the balance sheet to support above-market loan growth to look to try and make some key investments or
acquisitions in the HSA space or portfolios or people in Commercial Banking as we continue to expand those.
And we've obviously been working diligently in those areas and looking at opportunities.
Absent that, you saw in the third quarter we had an increase in our authorization to $200 million for a stock
repurchase so that if those internal strategic things don't work, we'll then look at other capital actions, either
another increase in the dividend. We had a significant increase in the dividend. And if none of those are available
to us, I think what you'll see is us being more likely to buy back shares over the next couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. It's great color. Thanks. And then just finally for Glenn, do you know what's the percentage of the loan book
now tied to one-month LIBOR and prime? Has that changed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So we have about $8.3 billion tied to one-month LIBOR and another, say, $2.5 billion tied to prime.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
...John and Jim, I just want to also echo what others have said, congratulations. Just going back to HSAs, can you
help us think about – we saw a drop, I guess if you will, on HSAs – or rather an increase in HSA efficiency ratio,
so it'd been previously running 50%, 51% and it was 55%. Can you help us think about how that's going to look
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. So I think a lot will depend on the enrollment period, as Chad highlighted, and the balances that we get. I
think one of the factors that is driving that, Laurie, is the reduction in the credit rate from – if you just look, from
year-over-year fourth quarter versus prior year's fourth quarter, the credit rate that we apply to the deposits is
down 15 basis points. So on a base of $6.5 billion, that has an impact. So that's one of the things you see driving
that. The other side of it is on the expense side, as Chad pointed out, we continue to invest in the front-end
customer experience and things like that, all for the longer term view of capturing more market share.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Okay. That's helpful. And then do you all have any goals with respect to what you would like HSA PPNR to be
relative to Webster's PPNR as you roll forward? And again that had been tracking closer to 25%, came in at 23%
this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
How should we be thinking about that next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean it's a very interesting question, Laurie. We've always managed it as – and you've heard Jim say this
before me, so this is about a five-year consistent messages that we want to kind of maximize the value of HSA
given its growth potential and its unique characteristics. So we don't look at it as what is the optimal level of
contribution. Our real focus is at some point if it got to be too big, a concentration risk or other elements, we might
think about other strategic alternatives. But right now, in this – if you look at it from round numbers, the
commercial bank's contributing about 50% of PPNR. For the full year 2019, Chad's group is about 25% to 30%,
and then the balance in Community Banking, we think that's a really good mix. And based on our forecast going
forward, Chad will be a bigger contributor relative to Community Banking, but it certainly won't get to a place
where we think we need to make adjustments in our strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. That's great. And then can you just update us on the relationships you flagged last quarter, so you had the
likely departure of two custodial HSA relationships from the third-party administrator wholesale portfolio? I think
one was being acquired and one was becoming a non-bank custodian. Can you just help us think about where we
are in seeing that reflected in the balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, and I can answer that question, I think, really easily and clearly. So the guidance doesn't change, meaning
over the next six quarters, that whole activity will result in financial neutrality given the fact that we get exit fees
and some other income as those accounts leave. In 4Q 2019, no accounts moved and we received none of that
compensation. So there was no noise in the 4Q numbers, either in balances or in the P&L related to those, and
we believe that that will start impacting us. In the first quarter when we report to you on our full enrollment period,
as we said last quarter, we will provide in each quarter growth dynamics of HSA with and without those two
custodial accounts. And we'll let you know what's moved out and what portion of income is also related to exit
fees and other. So we'll be very careful and very transparent, but in Q4, there was no impact at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then would you just remind us what those two relationships constitute just in terms of HSA deposits as
well as investments?

Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just curious, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about new commercial real estate and C&I loan yields and
spreads and how that compares to what's on the average balance sheet today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I'll give you a little bit of data. So, if you think about just – I'll give you a perspective on originated 4Q CRE,
the average spread was [ph] 1.52% (00:46:44). And so if you think about the LIBOR plus [ph] 1.52% (00:46:49) in
our CRE as opposed to kind of LIBOR plus [ph] mid-3s (00:46:53) in sponsor and specialty, that kind of gives you
the delta in spreads and what mix can do ultimately when we have a mix change. What else can I answer for
you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
How those spreads evolved over the past year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
I would say they're about – in CRE in this quarter, they're about 25 to 30 basis points lower than they were a year
ago. And I think as I look at all of the transactions that came in, I think it's just a result of asset quality, less a
result of competitive nature. So we had a lot of high quality, low LTV, high debt service coverage deals come in in
4Q, and so again, I don't think that tells me anything about the competitive landscape as much as it does the
quality of the transactions we brought in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. My last question is just around the growth outlook, still very strong. If you go to the middle or high
end, you're still looking at mid to high single-digit loan growth and versus some of your peers including in market
peers, it's strikingly higher. What do you attribute that to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think we look just internally at our momentum. We have the highest 12/31 pipeline in commercial bank that
we've had over the last 10 years. And obviously, we had a really good fourth quarter with respect to growth. And
so I think we go into the year with some good momentum on our average loan balances, which is what drives net
interest income and a pretty strong pipeline. And some of the areas that generally are good growth drivers for us
had slower second half to the year. And just where we are, we think that given – as I said to Collyn earlier in the
20


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
call, given our wide portfolio of geographies and different business lines and expertise in certain industry
segments, we think that that mid-single digits, if you will, on a total portfolio basis is a good number. Our
commercial loan growth including Investor CRE is probably going to be slightly higher than that with our consumer
lending categories being slightly lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And as we think about commercial real estate growth this quarter versus perhaps the past two or three,
was there a change in where you lend geography wise? And if so, where were you more focused this quarter than
in prior periods?

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
It's a great question, Matt. The Chief Risk Officer is here in the room, came in before to give me the data that
there's actually really almost no geographic disparity from prior quarters. So it really was a question as I
mentioned earlier of significantly fewer pay-downs. So our originations in CRE were about the same dollar size in
fundings as they were a year ago 4Q. It was just payments were down significantly. And I took a look at the data
with respect to property type, geography, weighted average loan to value, and debt service coverage, and none of
those metrics really changed. So I would say it's blocking and tackling, business as usual, no change in strategy,
not different dynamics, just significantly fewer pay-downs.

Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Just one more if I could sneak it in. You mentioned potential portfolio opportunities in your
capital management commentary and I never really considered that for you before, never thought it was on the
radar. Can you just be a little bit more specific as to what you meant? I'm assuming the loan portfolios, but could
you clarify? And if so, what types of asset classes and geographies are you looking for? If you've looked at
opportunities in past, could you just give us a sense for how many?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. And we've been consistent. We have talked about it and it is referring to commercial loan portfolios in
particular. So I would say where we look for areas where we have expertise, we've looked at equipment finance
portfolios, some secured loan portfolios to kind of offset some of our sponsor and specialty enterprise reliant
exposure. So we look for good yielding, economically profitable portfolio acquisitions that will either enhance an
existing specialty or an existing line of business or provide us with an inroad into something that we find attractive
at the current period of time. The truth of the matter is we have not in the last at least eight quarters besides the
residential mortgage portfolio acquisition that we did up in Boston for strategic purposes. We have not
successfully acquired a commercial loan portfolio over the course of the last eight quarters.
