Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the
horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump.
We are grateful that he is safe and also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were
tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country. There's no place in our politics for
violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we
disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur
reflection and action that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society.
Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in
both Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. I am pleased with our performance, where we
produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first half of the year. We continue to
harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic
environments.
In Global Banking & Markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announced and completed
M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up significantly this
quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of a capital markets and M&A recovery. And while
certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well-positioned to benefit
from a continued resurgence in activity.
We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FICC and equities, as our global, broad and deep
franchise remained active in supporting clients risk intermediation and financing needs. We continue to be
focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three of 118 of our
top 150 clients.
In Asset & Wealth Management, we are growing more durable management and other fees and private banking
and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter. Our assets under supervision had
a record of $2.9 trillion and total Wealth Management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a
23% margin for the first half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2024
In alternatives, we raised $36 billion year-to-date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the
quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real
estate investing strategies. Given the stronger than anticipated fundraising in the first half of the year, as well as
our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to
our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the
additional growth opportunities for our Asset & Wealth Management platform.
Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there's a high
level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policy and
inflation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand, the environment in the US remains
relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory
improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs.
I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our board of
directors spent a week in Silicon Valley, where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the
cutting-edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the
accelerating innovation in technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it
significant demand-related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad
franchise.
Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our
recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the
strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity,
which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests.
Given this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the
increase in requirements, we remain very well-positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with
our capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to
dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase
in our repurchase activity, our common equity tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized
approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter.
We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, which underscores our confidence and the durability
of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level
of $3 a share.
I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit in the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public
company. We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm, and it's been an eventful 25 years since
then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dotcom bubble,
the Nasdaq crash, September 11, the financial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame
these challenges, I immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our
core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence,
maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most
talented people.
In closing, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning
into our core strengths and effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment.

Now, let me turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the second
quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share
of $8.62 and ROE of 10.9% and an ROTE of 11.6%.
Now turning to performance by segment starting on page 4. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.2
billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the
prior-year period. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $423 million, as equity capital markets
have continued to reopen, though volumes remain well below longer-term averages.
Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leverage finance activity. We are seeing a
material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back
of increasing M&A activity.
Our backlog rose significantly quarter-on-quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FICC net
revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Intermediation results rose on better
performance in rates and currencies. FICC financing revenues were $850 million, a near-record and up 37% year-
over-year.
Equities net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 7% year-on-year, as higher intermediation results were
helped by better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a
record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially. Taken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2
billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow
financing across both FICC and equities continues to yield results, as these activities increase the durability of our
revenue base.
Now moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year-over-year.
As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues
reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a
record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision.
Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707 million. Our premier ultra-high-net-worth
wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor
to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite
of alternative products, a great example of the power of this unique platform. We expect continued momentum in
this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint.
Our pre-tax margin for the first half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and
approaching our mid-20s medium-term target.
Now moving to page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by
$31 billion of long-term net inflows largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of
long-term fee-based inflows.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2024
Turning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving
$548 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36
billion for the first half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment
portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion.
On page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in
higher-yielding assets and a shift towards noninterest-bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was
$184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million,
primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115
million related to our wholesale portfolio.
Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date
compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion and
included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2024 was
21.6%. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%.
Next, capital on slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock
dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher-than-expected SCB
requirement, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter. We will dynamically deploy
capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement.
Our board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a
reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable, growing dividend and our confidence in the
increasing durability of our franchise.
In conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our
interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our
more durable revenue streams, including record first half revenues across FICC and equities financing,
management and other fees, and private banking and lending. We remain confident in our ability to drive strong
returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi, there. Thanks very much. So I liked for forward-leaning comments on the IB fee pipeline and I think I heard
you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high. Does that infer anything about us being any
closer to an inflection point in private equity-related M&A, sponsor-related M&A? And then, how much of an event
think you have as being maybe the big – the only big bank that has a full-on private credit platform, obviously,
DCM platform and lending platform? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Glenn, and thanks for the question. We're forward-leaning in our comments, because we
definitely see momentum pick up. And I just, again, want to highlight something that was definitely in my part of
the script, and I think Denis amplified, which we're still – despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are
still significantly below 10-year averages and so, for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to
10-year averages on M&A.
One of the reasons that M&A activity – one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A
activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so, I think,
especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind
of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity. We're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors and obviously, it's been
way, way below. The overall M&A activity is kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has
been running below that and we're starting to see that increase.
Now as that increases, I just think the firm's incredibly well-positioned given the breadth of both our leading
position – we've been top kind of one, two, three in what I'll call leverage financed activity from a league table
perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private
credit platform, and so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position.
The size and the scope of the companies that are out there, that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold,
changed hands, sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds to their limited partners, I think, bodes well over
the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than
we've seen in the last two, two-and-a-half years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that. Maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that – in your printed
prepared remarks that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter. Can you talk
about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during quarter? Thanks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2024
Sure, Glenn. It's Denis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity
investment line is that in the prior-year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early
mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet and the results that reflect
in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So, that is I think a
large explain of the delta.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to spend some time on capital, post the SCB increase. One, maybe just from a
business standpoint, if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the
firm has been leaning into the financing business? Do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as
usual? So, one, how does it impact the business? And second, Denis, your comments on buybacks moderating.
Should we think more like 1Q levels of buybacks going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Ebrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess, first, important to observe that the level of capital that we're
operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent with where we've been over the last several years. So, we
feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis
points is at the wider end of our historical operating range. We have lots of capacity, both to continue to deploy
into the client franchise and with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there
could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing,
as David was referencing or the ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses, we have the
capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. Given the $3.5 billion
number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases.
But we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see develop from the client franchise, we will make
that assessment. We'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to
continue to return capital to shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. So, assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the financing business and just separately in
terms of sponsor-led activity, we waited all year for things to pick up. Is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are
not able to monetize assets? Does it speak to inflated valuations that they are carrying these assets on? Just
would love any context there, David, if you could? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that
there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently
hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point,
there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. And as they take that
optionality to wait, the pressure just build. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a
forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the valuation parameters and move forward. But I just think

this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity. For sure, I'm just not smart enough to tell you
exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to back – go back to more normalized levels.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Well, thanks very much. I did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the
expense line as we're going through this environment, because we've had this very nice pickup in revenues, and
comp ratio is going up a little bit. But I'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? Or is
this just a one-off given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our revenues net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the
year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we
always do, which is making our best estimate for what we expect to pay on a full year basis and doing that in a
manner that reflects the performance of the firm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on
what we see, we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that
closely as the balance of the year evolves.

Denis P. Coleman A

Operator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged, Denis, the record financing revenue, which clearly
shows momentum behind the business. And it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable
for quite some time now, seems to reflect balanced growth. So, one, I want to confirm that that's fair? And could
you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate
cuts might be on the horizon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Brennan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing
ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within Global Banking & Markets. We have our
human capital and underwriting infrastructure setup in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients
that are frequent users of these products. The business is very diversified by sub-asset class and it's a business
that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is
generating attractive risk-adjusted returns, and that's something that we're going to remain mindful of, but we
believe given the breadth of that franchise that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that
our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then next question is really sort of a follow-on from Betsy's line of questioning. So year-to-date, you've
got a 64% efficiency ratio. When we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric
and an environment – consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily, how should we be thinking
about margins on incremental revenue? Could you help us understand how revenue growth would continue to
drive improvement in that efficiency ratio.

Sure. So, thank you for that question, and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously,
our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target
of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better
and better efficiency, but ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract
variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue
to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses
associated with that. And we do have a very granular process internally looking at each of our expense categories
on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we, at the
same time, look to drive top line revenues.

Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. I mean,
you highlight revenue growth in Global Banking & Markets and Wealth & Asset Management; you have record
financing for equities and FICC combined; you're number one in M&A; you have record management fees, record
assets under supervision; your efficiencies gone from 74% to 64%; you increased your dividend by 9% to signal
your confidence; your CET1 ratio's 90 basis points above even the higher Fed requirement. So, David, you
started off the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 11% ROE in the
second quarter, that's not quite the 15% where you wanted to be. So where's the disconnect from what you're
generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey and the way I look at it, our returns for the
first half of the year are 12.8%. I think there are a couple of things, give/gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a
little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through, and so that will come out. And at some
point as we work through that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that. So the
returns in the first half of the year would be a little higher ex that. And then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly
on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in
terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I, obviously, can't predict. But if you look at the
returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm and we're going to continue to focus on that.
Now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So, you know and you can see the
performance over the course of the last few years of Global Banking & Markets, but we've said the AWM ROE is
not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've got the margin up to 23%, but the
ROE is still around 10%. We think we can continue to grow the business, as we've said, high-single digits. We
can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM ROE and then you look across the firm and
you have a stronger return profile. So, I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not [audio gap]
(00:30:05-00:30:10) work to do, for sure, but we feel good about the progress.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

And I assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in. Can you just
describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on past cycles.

What I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is the return
to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above
10-year averages, but there's, obviously, if we did get back to that period and there will be some point in the future
where we went above average, too, not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. But as a general matter,
when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing
attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance
sheets. They need to manage risks, to restructure transactions, and so there's a multiplier effect as those
activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction
volumes increase on the M&A side.

And then lastly for your returns, the denominator is a big factor. So, how does that work with the Fed? I know you
can't say too much and [ph] regional (00:31:35) people can disagree. But your whole point is that you de-risked
the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the Fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. So
how does this process work from here? Will we hear results about the SCB ahead, or is this something that's just
behind closed doors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Look, as a general matter – what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe
it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really insure the safety and soundness of the banking
system. However, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting
from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks
transparency. It contributes to excess volatility in the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes
prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect a
significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations despite the fact that
the scenarios are consistent year-over-year.
Now, despite all that, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital
flexibility. And we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that, over time, we can drive the level
of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But, obviously, we have more work to do given this
result.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Just wanted to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. They were down only modestly despite
the absence of the GreenSky contribution. Just want to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer
revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look out to next
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean, on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have
the absence of the GreenSky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think the – you've
seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting
adjustments to the card originations. And so our expectation is that on the forward, the period-over-period growth
should be more muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And maybe just one more clarifying question. I know there's been a lot asked about the SCB. Really
just wanted to better understand, Denis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is
actually above normal, just how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to Basel III endgame.
There's certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even public comments from
regulators. But just want to better understand given the uncertainty around both the SCB and Basel III endgame,
where you're comfortable running on a CET1 basis over the near to medium term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, and I appreciate that question. I think, obviously, there's been a lot of change. There's been some
changes in expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to
signal flexibility and certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty, which does remain with
respect to Basel III endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution.
It sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that that may not be something that comes into effect until
perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that, I think, is appropriate in light of what we
know and what we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to
support clients, return capital to shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering
uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Hi. Great. Good morning, David and Denis. Couple of questions on AWM progress. So the first one is on the alts
business specifically and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set
the $1 billion medium-term target for annual incentive fees. And now with over $500 billion in alts AUM and
obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative. So, I appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate
the returns ahead here. But how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more
normal harvesting environment, just given the mix shift and the growth that you're seeing in AUM there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that that's going to be a more
meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The
contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal
medium to longer term perspective. We do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at
the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion. So, you can make various assumptions as to what the timing of the
recognition of those fees are. They can obviously bounce around from time-to-time.
It is a granular vehicle-by-vehicle buildup. But given the current outlook and status of those funds, that's our best
expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. So, I think it is an
important incremental contributor and should be – should help the return profile of Asset & Wealth Management
on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to
feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and
beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Denis. And then a follow-up. This is also kind of connected. But at a recent conference, you
highlighted the margin profile of all the stand-alone businesses in Asset & Wealth Management of public peers, so
kind of as a comparison, and highlighted 35%-plus for alts. And some of the public firms we know are, obviously,
well above that. So, I appreciate your running the AWM segment as kind of one segment. But if alts does
accelerate, and we're looking at 60% of alts AUM isn't even fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment
margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target? Because you're already at 23% thus far in 2024? So, just trying to
think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth particularly from the alts segment as
well?

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us, because despite the breadth
and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to
actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities, in particular, relative to the overall AWM margin,
particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy. And so, in addition to just overall growth in the segment,
which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business again
despite its current scale presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. In terms of your on-balance sheet investment, you continue to make progress in reducing
that this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for this year, or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think
about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on-balance sheet exposures,
also part of the equity and capital story in returns in the segment. At $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent
reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at
$12.6 billion by the end of next year (sic) [2026], but our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it
across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our
commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year (sic) [2026].
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And as a follow-up, just within Asset & Wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target
raised for the full year given the success you've had, the private credit fund closing here in the first half was big.
Can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or
maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large – increasing momentum as you think about second half, but
also as we – even into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, obviously, taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set. Once upon a time, it was
$150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion. And with $36 billion raised through the first half
and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year. And
I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across
multiple asset classes within alternatives. Equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure, we had notable fundraising in
private credit and real estate this quarter. But you could see contributions from other strategies like equity on the
15

forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So, we think we have a
diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.

Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape, specifically in
banking and markets. I know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers are leaning in who
haven't been a few years ago and all these regional banks that I cover are also realizing that they need broader
capital market capabilities. So, you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and
markets and just wondering how you're seeing kind of the competition impact you at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Matt. Appreciate the question. I'd just say, investment banking and the markets business, the trading
business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very
competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there,
depending on how you look at it, what you look at. There's always going to be competition. There are always
going to be people that come in and make investments in the key areas. But broadly speaking, we have leading
M&A share for 25 years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've
continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. And then our trading businesses and
our ability to intermediate risk, I think, have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long
time. And so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right
resources, both human capital and financial capital to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we
have global scale positions us very well. We'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits, and I
don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it and continue to have it
operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful, [ph] and I agree (00:44:22). And then just separately, I hate to ask you about activity levels
and stuff like that since the debate three or four weeks ago, but maybe I'll frame it. From your experience in
Presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like, how do both
institutional and corporate clients react? Do they kind of say, well, let's wait and see the other side? Is it just noise,
because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
There are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a
crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring. But I think we're well
positioned to serve our clients regardless of the environment. And clients are very active at the moment and I
think they're probably going to continue to be active.

Hi, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. You took the board out to Silicon Valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we
could expect in the future and the opportunities for Goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure
needs that may come of that. Can you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing
within Goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it
more efficient.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we, as most companies around the world, are focused on how you can
create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service
firm and a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people, creating tools that allow
them to focus their productivity on things and advance their ability to serve clients for interactive markets is a very,
very powerful tool.
So we – if you look and you think across the scale of our business, I think you can think of lots of places where
the capacity to use these tools, to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and a lot of the very
smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. You can look at it in an area like
the equity research area as every quarter, you're all analysts on the phone, there's lots of ways that these tools
can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients.
You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have, what
I'll call, the factory of the business, prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, their evolution there.
When you look at the datasets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients so
that they can make better decisions around the way they position the markets, that's another obvious use case.
For our engineering stack, and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their
coding productivity is meaningful.
So those are a handful. There are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But
again, I'd step back. While this will increase our productivity, the thing that we're most excited about is all
businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business, and that
will create more activity and a tailwind broadly for our business as people will need to make investment, will need
financing, will need to scale, and so we're excited about that broad opportunity.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, Denis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any
charge-offs in the wholesale book. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there. It seems like there
must be some improvement since, obviously, you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did
see in this quarter was release and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able, as a
consequence, to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. So, while that was a contributing
benefit to sort of, call it, the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release,
that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. And although we
manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we
will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're
pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On – just a follow-up on capital. I mean, it certainly is
encouraging that your CET1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you
did have, I think, a $16 billion reduction in RWAs. Your presentation talks about credit RWAs falling this quarter. I
guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? And I guess, more importantly, is
there continued room for RWA optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization is something that we've
been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions, both in credit and market
risk RWAs, drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places,
lower level of volatility. We try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as
being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or falling through in our strategic plan and narrow focus
and reduce balance sheet exposure. So, that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit
despite the buyback activity we executed and it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity
of binding constraints that we operate under.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on financing, FICC financing up 37%, equities –
equity financing is now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. I guess, how
18


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2024
much more room is there – or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set to continue to grow
from here? How much more space is there [ph] to use financing (00:51:30) as a mechanism to help deepen
penetration with your top institutional clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
That's a good question, Saul. I think, on the FICC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping
clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And we think, based on
what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess risk return
opportunity set across the client portfolio. So, we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to
support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business.
In equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously, have benefited from equity market inflation over the
course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. And clients
look to us on a holistic basis really across both FICC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're
doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them
with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected
activities with clients, and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow.
