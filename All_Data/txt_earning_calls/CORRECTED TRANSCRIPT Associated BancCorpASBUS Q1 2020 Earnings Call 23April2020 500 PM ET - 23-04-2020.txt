Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Niles, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. As you can see from our materials, Associated
continued to meet the needs of our customers, grow and generate net profit during the first three months of the
year.
We continue to benefit from a resilient core funding base, a strong market presence and a high quality lending
portfolio. But I'll start by discussing our response to the radically changed environment we are now experiencing.
The past two months were extraordinary. Let me highlight the actions we've taken to help our customers and
protect our colleagues.
We closed our branch lobbies on March 17, becoming one of the first banks to transition to drive-through and by-
appointment-only service. Our branch operations and IT teams have responded wonderfully to meet the needs of
our customers. We began to send people to work remotely on March 13 and now have about 70% of our
colleagues performing their jobs from home. We are continuing to pay all of our colleagues including those whose
jobs were curtailed by our social distancing measures. We were also quick to offer our own COVID-19 Relief
Program providing customers waivers of certain fees and deferrals of loan and mortgage payments. Through
Tuesday approximately 1,450 primarily consumer and small business loan customers have been granted some
form of payment or fee relief.
From a financial perspective, we were ready to meet all of our customers' needs with both lending availability and
transactional liquidity as our core deposits increased even faster than loans. Our loan-to-deposit ratio
strengthened during the quarter.
In addition since quarter end, we've continued to support our small business customers through the SBA
paycheck protection program. As of April 21, we have funded nearly $900 million of loans for more than 3,600
businesses. We are ready to support our customers in the second round of the PPP program and other programs
that may come from the Fed, the treasury or the SBA.
We've also continued to support our communities in these difficult times. We continue to donate over $3 million a
year to support local housing programs, food banks and other essential services. In addition, we recently donated
$300,000 to the United Way and other local COVID-19 relief efforts in our footprint. Standing up new loan
programs and processes while working remotely has been hard, but we've met these challenges and stand ready
to help our customers get through this difficult period.
So now let me turn to the financial results.
On slide 4, our first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.27 per share driven by resilient net interest income and
reduced expenses excluding first on the First Staunton acquisition-related costs, our earnings were $0.28 per
share. We had a strong loan growth, particularly in our commercial and business lending portfolio as customers
drew on lines of credit for their own liquidity. The line draws, in turn, drove increased deposits as customers built
up cash positions. The First Staunton acquisition which closed on February 14 also contributed to loan and core
deposit growth.
Our net interest margin increased 1 basis point from the fourth quarter driven by a lower cost of funds and
elevated LIBOR rates. The slightly higher margin coupled with loan growth resulted in a $20 million increase in
our pre-tax, pre-provision income from the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 9.36%, giving us ample capital to
fund our commitments and support additional loan growth even after repurchasing $71 million of common stock in
the quarter.

We also implemented CECL as of January 1, resulting in a one-time $131 million increase to our allowance for
credit losses and a first quarter provision of $53 million reflecting our economic outlook going forward.
Average loan balances are shown on slide 5. Total loan balances were up $525 million from the fourth quarter as
we saw increases in residential mortgages, commercial and business lending, and commercial real estate.
Residential mortgage growth was driven by solid origination trends and lower payoffs in the first two months of the
quarter. While we anticipate payoffs to be elevated in the second quarter due to lower rates, our pipeline
continues to be strong. We've taken about $2.5 billion in mortgage applications this year through mid-April, which
is about double the pace we saw over the same period last year.
Growth in our commercial and business portfolio was driven by our power & utilities vertical. Additionally, general
commercial lending and REITs had strong growth in the quarter. While customer drives in March contributed to
the increase, we also had strong pipeline production offsetting these gains were a seasonal decline in mortgage
warehouse through much of the quarter and the purposeful runoff of our oil and gas portfolio. We expect to
continue the reduction of our oil and gas book as we pursue additional credit risk mitigation opportunities. We also
saw solid results from our focus on growing commercial real estate term debt, particularly in January and
February. Commercial real estate construction loans also increased as we funded construction loans in our
pipeline.
Turning to slide 6, we show end of period loan trends which highlights activity we saw in March and April. In mid-
March, we began experiencing a significant uptick in general commercial lending as customers drew on lines of
credit and built up cash. We also had a large increase in mortgage warehouse loans as lower mortgage rates
induced a refinancing wave in March.
In CRE, customers increased line draws and delayed payoffs in March and we expect CRE balances to remain
elevated through the rest of the year. Customer demands for liquidity and refinancing activity have subsided in
April, as shown in the right-hand graph. This chart also highlights the impact of our participation in the Paycheck
Protection Program that we further detail on slide 7.
We began taking applications for the PPP on April 3, the first day it was offered by the SBA. Standing up a new
loan program is always difficult and this one was made more so by the tight timeline, change in guidance and by
working remotely. Through great effort and dedication of several hundred of our colleagues, we created all the
forms and processes and modified systems to support the program in a matter of days.
Through April 21, we had funded over 3,600 customers for nearly $900 million of loans, representing about 90%
of the dollars and about 70% of the loans that were applied for. We have taken advantage of the Fed's PPP
lending facility to fund these loans. We expect our customers will begin applying for loan forgiveness in late June
and anticipate a bulk of the loans will be forgiven during the third quarter.
With the expected extension of the PPP program, we expect to fund the remaining 1,300 applications we received
representing an additional $80 million of loans. We've already taken all those applications through the process, so
that we'll be ready to get SBA authorization as soon as their portal opens. In turn, we expect to access the funds,
PPP lending facility to fund these loans as well.
On March 21, we initiated our COVID-19 Relief Program by offering loan deferrals and fee waivers to our
business and consumer customers. Through April 21, we've approved deferrals or modifications for over 1,450
loans, totaling approximately $733 million, which is about 3% of our total loans. The approved loans include $303

million or about 5% of the commercial real estate book, mostly driven by our hotel and retail-oriented borrowers,
$179 million or 2% of our commercial and business lending book, and $250 million of residential and consumer
loans we hold in our own portfolio. Additionally, in the first 30 days of our COVID-19 release program we waived
or refunded $415,000 in fees for consumers and small businesses. We are pleased to be able to help relieve
some of our customer's financial stress and to be part of the economic solution to this crisis.
Turning to slide 8, the current environment has introduced new risks. On slide 8, we've laid out our exposures to
several categories of commercial loans potentially impacted by COVID-19 and lower hydrocarbon prices. These
balances represent 9% or $2.2 billion of outstanding loans at the end of the first quarter. We've increased portfolio
monitoring activities across the bank and are proactively working with our borrowers to help them navigate the
current environment. Our largest likely area of exposure representing nearly 5% of the loan book is to retailers
and shopping centers. Approximately $528 million of the retailer category is in CRE.
In addition, we have approximately $453 million loan to predominantly investment-grade retailer-oriented REITs.
We continue to monitor our oil and gas portfolio which now accounts for less than 2% of our loan book with
demand disruptions pushing the cost of oil down dramatically.
We've set aside additional loan last reserves against our oil and gas portfolio during the first quarter. While many
of our customers have hedged their positions over the near term and it may take a while for losses to develop, we
expect a prolonged period of lower prices that will stress the industry. Our exposure to the hospitality industry is
fairly limited with just over $200 million of loans to hotels, representing less than 1% of total loans. We also carry
approximately $100 million in loans to restaurants and other food service companies. Beyond that, we have
limited exposures with just one customer in each of the casino, movie theater or fracking sand mining business.
Turn to slide 9, we've outlined the bank's transition to CECL in the first quarter. We implemented CECL
leveraging, Moody's baseline forecasts at both the beginning and the end of the quarter. Our Day 1 allowance for
credit losses adjustment came in at $131 million which was reserved as of January 1. The higher level of day one
adoption relative to our prior guidance was largely driven by an increase in identified probable troubled debt
restructurings in our oil and gas portfolio and the fracking sand mining company.
With respect to our provision for the quarter, we leveraged the Moody's March 27 baseline forecast and identified
additional probable TDRs in the oil and gas book, given changes in price and the dynamics in the industry.
Further, in response to the overall economic environment, we also added additional reserves for our key
commercial loan exposures which we highlighted on the prior slide and bolstered our unfunded commitment
provision by $16 million. These factors drove the majority of our $53 million provision for the quarter.
Our net Q1 reserve build of $40 million reflects the provision, net of charge-offs and changes in our CECL
modeling along with the increased expected prepayments on mortgages. In aggregate, our total allowance for
credit losses on loans was $394 million at quarter end, as compared to $223 million at year end. We believe this
$171 million reserve build, a 76% increase, adequately reflects the life of loan risks in our portfolio given the
economic outlook at March 31.
Our current allowance levels also cover over 65% of our potential losses as produced in our last internal severely
adverse stress test scenario. $64 million of the reserve build was specific to our remaining oil and gas portfolio
and we ended the quarter with an ACLL reserve of nearly 17% against oil and gas. Our overall blended ACLL
represents 162 basis points of total loans, with nearly 2% set against our CRE exposures and just under 1% set
against our predominantly first mortgage consumer loan portfolio.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Turning to slide 10. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the credit environment remained benign outside of oil and
gas. Given the sudden economic downturn in customer relief programs, our credit metrics outside of oil and gas
remained relatively steady. During the quarter, potential problem loans increased $73 million to $234 million,
driven by a few CRE credits, along with some additional oil and gas names. Nonaccrual loans saw an $18 million
uptick, with $5 million coming from oil and gas and the majority of the remaining increase attributed to general C&I
and residential mortgages. Net charge-offs were $17 million, with about half coming from oil and gas and the rest
in general C&I.
To address the disruption brought on by COVID-19, the company has taken a proactive approach to monitor
customers impacted. Loan officers have reached out to their customers to understand their capital and liquidity
needs. This outreach has been an essential component of the company's relief programs as we support our
customers through this turbulent time. Along with our customer outreach we've undertaken a deep examination of
our loan portfolio to identify industries with additional risk exposure. We continue detailed monitoring of the
specific industries. In addition to the overall portfolio as we analyze delinquencies and deferrals as leading
indicators of credit issues in this evolving environment.
Turning to slide 11, average deposits were up nearly $190 million from the fourth quarter. The average deposit
balance growth was driven by the First Staunton acquisition which added about $440 million of deposits in mid-
February. Our end-of-period balances increased nearly $1.9 billion, including 1.6 billion of low-cost demand and
savings deposits that came later in the quarter as our customers still get cash. These inflows resulted in a
beneficial mix shift and low-cost deposits made up 58% of our overall deposits at the end of the quarter.
Turning to slide 12, the inflow deposits has also enabled us to maintain strong liquidity. Our wholesale funding
ratio has remained stable, demonstrating our continuing ability to fund most of our loans with deposits. While we
expect to continue funding loans with deposits, we have $11 billion of wholesale funding available including $6
billion of capacity of the FHLB in Chicago. These figures do not include the additional liquidity that's available to
us through the Fed's PPP lending facility. Our loan to deposit ratio was 95% well within our historical range which
gives us the flexibility to maintain deposit pricing discipline and we expect to maintain this ratio below 100%.
Turn to slide 13, our net interest income was $203 million, an increase of $3 million from the previous quarter and
our net interest margin was 2.84%, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter. There were several factors that drove
the modest increase in NII and NIM.
On the asset side, one month LIBOR remains significantly elevated over Fed fund rates, particularly in March,
positively impacting CRE and commercial and business lending yields. This benefit was offset by a decrease in
long-term interest rates resulting in elevated refinancing in the residential mortgage book and the payoff of higher
coupon loans in March. Additionally, this increased prepayment rate drove accelerated recognition of deferred
origination costs further reducing our mortgage yield.
On the liability side, our total interest-bearing deposit cost decreased 19 basis points as we reduced pricing
across our full suite of deposit products. Total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 17 basis points aided by a
beneficial mix shift toward low cost deposits and reduced wholesale funding costs. These factors were most
pronounced in March resulting in a NIM for 2.89% for that month.
Looking ahead, we expect the commercial loan yields will continue to benefit from elevated LIBOR rates in April
and at least somewhat into May. We anticipate the LIBOR Fed fund's spread will normalize later in 2020 as
economic conditions become less uncertain. We also expect our deposit costs to continue to decline in the
second quarter as we benefit from [ph] CD (00:19:31) run-off and a full quarter impact from our reduced pricing

but note that our month-to-date April cost of interest-bearing deposits is already running at approximately 36 basis
points.
Turning to slide 14, first quarter noninterest income of $98 million was up $5 million from last quarter and up $7
million year over year. Our insurance income was seasonally higher as we received property and casualty
contingency fees in the quarter and our capital markets groups saw revenue lifts driven by market volatility. We
also benefited from $15 million of gross mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter. But that was partially offset
by a $9 million MSR impairment, resulting in $6 million of net mortgage banking income.
However, most other fee categories were soft during Q1, due in part to our COVID-19 Relief Program and lower
market levels, impacting assets under management and investment activity. These declines in other fee
categories were largely offset by net gains realized on the further sell-down of prepayment-sensitive mortgage-
backed securities.
Moving to slide 15, noninterest expense of $192 million was down $11 million from the fourth quarter. This
decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs, as we reduced expected incentive compensation, had less
hiring in response to the current environment and are seeing the benefits of the restructuring done in the fourth
quarter. Business development and advertising costs were $2 million lower during the quarter due to less
business travel and the planned reduction of advertising spend. Technology costs also decreased $2 million from
the reduction of third-party consultants, which took place at the end of last year.
Turning to slide 16, we look at our customer activity. As you'd expect, branch traffic is down since the pandemic
began, with April branch transactions about 17% lower than January. We also saw a 32% drop in ATM
transactions for the same time period as our customers increasingly chose to stay home.
However, with the significant investments we've made in digital technology over the last several years, our
customers were able to shift their activity from our branches to online and mobile. We saw an 86% uptick in
mobile sessions since January and an increase in the use of our [indiscernible] (00:22:02) application which
allows customers to open accounts online or from their mobile devices. Call center volume has also increased
32%, as we move communications with our customers into non-branch channels.
As shown on slide 17, our regulatory capital levels remain strong and we have sufficient capital to support further
loan growth if our customers continue to seek liquidity. CET1 was 9.36% at the end of the first quarter and we
anticipate it will build through the remainder of 2020. We repurchased $71 million of common stock in the quarter
but suspended our repurchase program on March 13. We expect our repurchase program to remain suspended
for the remainder of the year.
On slide 18, we discuss our outlook. Given the extraordinary economic uncertainty, our previous quantitative
guidance should no longer be relied upon. However, we'd like to provide more general expectations for the
remainder of the year. While we have ample liquidity and funding sources, we expect to be able to fund loan
growth with deposit growth and expect our loan to deposit ratio will remain under 100%.
Given the lack of attractive investments for our portfolio, we're now targeting an investments-to-total assets ratio
of 15%. We expect our mortgage banking business to continue to do well but it will likely be offset by lower
service charges as we provide relief to our customers. We'll also face headwinds in wealth management due to
lower market valuations.

We often speak about cost as being one factor that we control, we will continue our disciplined approach and
expect our expense run rate for the rest of the year to be in line with that of the first quarter. As mentioned, we
suspended our stock repurchase program on March 13, and expect that will remain as suspended for the
remainder of the year as we build capital.
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Sorry about that. Yeah, thanks guys. So, I guess focusing first on the energy reserves to 17%, it sounds like you
guys do present. Do you expect to prolong [ph] depressed (00:24:57) pricing here. Can you just, just give us a
little bit more color there. Can we expect more, more reserve build or do you feel like you have adequate reserves
at 17%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Pat, do you want to take that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So I think, in general, time will tell what we end up doing as the year goes on, we feel like we're adequately
reserved right now. However, with the kind of unprecedented environment we're dealing with oil and gas – we're
going to follow this closely as we get into the second quarter. Right now, our oil and gas portfolio has been
reduced almost 40% from a year ago. And as we've mentioned, it now represents about less than 2% of the total
portfolio. Now, the portfolio, as it sits today, is about 60-40 oil to gas. And we feel good about the fact that about
70% of the portfolio is hedged for 2020 and almost 50% hedged for 2021.
We are just kind of starting into the spring redetermination season right now. We've got about a third of our loans
have been – they have got results on that redetermination. And we're seeing some reductions in borrowing base
of about almost 20% to 25%, and our average loan commitments have been reduced by about 20%. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, very good. And on the [indiscernible] (00:26:30) front, I think you mentioned a deferral, $733 million.
Apologies if I missed this in the script but is that still trending up or is that is that stabilized, just getting some color
on the pace there?

There is, there is more to come clearly. Those are the deferrals that we've already granted. There are some more
to come. They're not going to go at the same pace, I wouldn't think that we saw over this past four weeks or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay great. And just a couple of follow-ups on the NIM, the LIBOR disconnect with Fed funds. It sounds like you
guys expect that to sort of normalize. I guess a little bit towards the end of this quarter. Just what is sort of baked
into your guide just for the quarter here, so we can just track that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So clearly it was elevated in March, it stepped down that delta, which was north of 80 basis points, it
stepped down to 60 basis points and we have a stepping down. The long-term average is closer to an eighth.
We're not sure it's going to get to an eighth necessarily much before the end of the year. But we certainly would
see it getting down into that much narrower range as we move to the end of the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And just last one on the deposit costs at 57% in March, how much more room do you have going forward
from that level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
So we mentioned it fell into the 30s in April and it will probably likely fall further slightly given the rollovers and
other repricing dynamics that will contribute to that. So it probably would be, again, less than – it will be in the 30s
in the second quarter and falling and likely less than that in the third quarter unless the environment shifts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We slashed our deposit pricing at the same time that the Fed took their last big whack at rates. And so
you'll see the full impact of that as we go through the quarter. But even as early as we are today in the second
quarter, we've dropped another 20 basis points overall.

Good afternoon, Scott.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. I guess first question I wanted to ask was on the reserve to total stress losses. I think so you said 54%,
which is obviously a pretty healthy number. I guess if I [ph] back (00:29:22) into what the reserve is relative to the
last time you guys did publicly disclosed stress test, it would have been closer to 55%, I mean, also it's very
healthy. But just curious if you guys can maybe walk through what has changed in either the portfolio complexion,
loss assumptions, what have you that would allow that reserve to kind of look better these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure, Scott. So I think you can do the math and then infer, yes, that our total stress losses in the severely adverse
scenario from our last public disclosure to our last internal run did come down several hundred million dollars. The
drivers of that, as Pat mentioned a little bit in part, were more than $400 million reduction in the oil and gas book.
And then the general mix of our portfolio which has become more overall mortgage-centric which has a lower loss
content in our models in general.
And the continued low levels of risky asset classes in the severe scenarios such as single family, construction
lending or [ph] for-sale (00:30:29) housing construction lending and condo-related activity. Now, our models were
obviously geared and tied to the realized outcomes of the prior results. So what will be – the outcomes next time
can shift but based on the models that we've had, those numbers, as we continue to mix the portfolio away from
those higher risk classes into steadier loan categories, have moved the total expect loss – potential loss down,
and obviously we moved the reserve up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. That's good color and I appreciate that. And then just wanted to ask one question just on capital.
So, common equity Tier 1 is still very solid and then I guess what's a little unique about the way this cycle seems
to be panning out is, whereas TCE ratio was like the all-important ratio last time around, presumably this time it's
got to have much less weight given that you'd get penalized on the TCE for PPP loans, but those are kind of
invisible from the standpoint of regulatory ratios. I guess in your guys' mind, how does the TCE factor into your
thinking in the way you sort of manage things this time around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, we've always said that we wanted to keep it at about 7% or above. And as you recall as we were building
toward CECL implementation, it had run out. So we expected CECL, we had First Staunton come in. What we
didn't expect is to have $1.5 billion loans flow on to the balance sheet at the end of March. So that took it down to
the 6.9% that you see. But if you exclude the PPP loans that will be sitting here although they are completely
funded by the Fed, it should creep up from here. With PPP, if you leave that in, of course, it'll be lower.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
The REITs have drawn their backup lines as you, as you know. I'm just trying to get to that page.

Page 6. It's page 8. So, yeah, so the REITs have drawn and kind of just general C&I not necessarily called out on
page 8, Terry, has drawn some. And, of course, we had a run-up in mortgage warehouse, but that's to be
expected.

Patrick E. Ahern A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Associated Banc-Corp
So, Terry, I guess I would add, and I apologize, I was looking at page 6. So, to Phil's comments just now, you can
see the general commercial loans is where they draw and the mortgage warehouse and the REIT, that's all at the
end of the quarter. And since then which is what we tried to highlight on the right hand side of page 6, we really
haven't seen incremental activity. So, the drawdown and liquidity-driven activity we saw in the last three weeks of
March really abated when we moved past April 1, and we really haven't seen any further of that activity here in the
second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just as my follow-up question. Do you any sense for the average fee on your PPP loans? It looks like
you're kind of average size is skewed a little bit larger than others which could, could impact that or would impact
that fee?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think we're figuring it's 3%-plus. We've got a lot of smaller stuff in the queue, like a lot of banks. I mean we
process the loans on a first-come-first-serve basis. But a lot of larger companies with professional finance staffs
were ready to go upfront. So it tended to skew larger at the beginning and as we wound it down, leading up to the
money running out, the loans tend to get much smaller and what's left in our queue and what's coming in now
tends to be smaller as well. So it'll probably be like 3%-ish, 3%-plus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q

Okay. That makes total sense. Great. Thank you.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Back on slide 6, just following up on Terry's question. It's probably a good sign that you haven't seen more line
draws [indiscernible] (00:36:11) but curious how long you expect some of those draws to hang around
[indiscernible] (00:36:18) those come back down. Any thoughts on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We generally feel that that a lot of these draws were just companies wanting to ensure their liquidity in the
face of turmoil. So things haven't calmed down yet. They've calmed down some, all of the Fed actions have
certainly helped a lot in the capital markets. So it's very hard to predict what's going to happen but my guess
would be that as this quarter rolls along and if things continue to stabilize, you'll probably see some of this money
come back just because people won't necessarily feel like they've got to be sitting on a ton of cash. But again, it's
a little hard to predict. The fact that we didn't continue to get draws past quarter end to any great degree, it feels
like there was a little bit of window dressing going on for some of the folks who drew these funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then on slide 9, it's a good slide I haven't seen CECL shown like this by category. So I think, I understand the
movement and everybody, but the two negative numbers assuming one is a length of loan and the other is
prepayment-driven. But can you can you just kind of address those two, so we understand that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
You are correct Terry in both cases. So, in the day 1 CECL adoption the negative in the commercial and business
lending, excluding oil and gas is adjusting for the fact that we have tend to have considerably shorter loan terms,
a lot of 364-day type facilities, et cetera. And therefore, our day one adoption was a reduction in the allocation of
reserve to those given the term-based nature of CECL. And similarly but for different reasons as we move through
the quarter and refinance rates fell. And therefore, prepayment rates, expected prepayment rates increased the
average life of the expected mortgages at the end of the quarter was and is expected to be shorter than it was at
the beginning. So that resulted in a net release in the mortgage line which is why you had a net negative reserve
build.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That helps. And then the next one is – this is – just trying to get this out of you, Chris, will be like trying to get the
Packers [ph] draft pick (00:38:55) early tonight. But second quarter loan loss provision, what are you watching or
kind of what are the nuances for Associated? What are the things that might be a little different about how you will
look at and think through the level necessary in terms of your second quarter provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah it is going to be hard to get that. And I'm on the Packers board. So I do know the [ph] draft pick (00:39:23) I
can tell you if you really want it.

Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We need a [indiscernible] (00:39:30). Yeah, obviously we're going to be looking at, well, let me think about that.
So a lot like let's think about hotels almost all of that's been deferred now. So that's probably not going to drive
much in the second quarter. A lot of our oil and gas build up we use the probable troubled debt restructuring
concept, which I don't think a lot of banks have used this much which was embedded CECL.
So, if we go through continued redetermination periods and we see continued market deterioration in collateral
positions you could end up with some more probable TDRs and see some build there. What else, will be
watching, obviously, delinquencies and such that we haven't deferred for one reason or another.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Associated Banc-Corp
And a change in the overall macro environment, right? So our view at the end of the quarter for CECL has a
certain macroeconomic outlook and in our internal discussions that had a fairly high and robust level of
recessionary outcomes 20-plus-percent type or 20% GDP type drops et cetera and it's plausible that two and a
half months from now that environment would either be perhaps to be perhaps different and more positive or
possibly worst as we work our way there.
Now, I would remain optimistic and say I'm hoping that things get better for the country and for all of us, in which
case, I think there is room that the economic outlook is a positive. In addition to the realized outcomes in our
portfolio either in oil and gas or hospitality or otherwise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, and last thing I would say is it certainly is more likely than not that there'll be a reserve build in the second
quarter just given now the environment here in the second quarter the continued unemployment claims that we
saw this morning, et cetera. But fortunately, PPNR looks pretty strong at the moment. So I think we've got plenty
of other ammunition for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Good evening. I wanted to first ask just on kind of balance sheet
management and growth from here. How you're thinking about that? Are you sort of hesitant to go out and make
14


Associated Banc-Corp

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
new loans to new customers at this point and really focus more internally? And how would you look at maybe
mortgage in this environment putting that on balance sheet versus selling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So the first part your question, Michael. We are absolutely here to support our customers' needs and we
are well-positioned to do that. We'll continue to do it. The second piece, we are generally in a position where
we're going to move the flow of mortgages and that's what we're doing now off to Fannie or whomever. So, we're
not putting a lot of mortgages on our balance sheet on purpose. That's not necessarily because of the run-ups
and loan outstandings. A lot of it has to do with you're really not encouraged to the CECL methodology to build up
a lot of mortgages on your own books. So we'll be in the mode generally speaking of originating and selling those
mortgages and retaining service, which has pretty much been our standard model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. So with higher prepayment [ph] speed (00:43:25) maybe on the existing book on the – would you expect I
guess those to – those balances to decline and/or would you look to replace those to maintain I guess the overall
weighting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
No, we – yeah, I would guess that our mix – I mean our mix already shifted quite dramatically at the end of the
first quarter. So I think you could expect the mix of our loan book to be less mortgage, more C&I, more CRE as
the year progresses. So, we're not going to do anything extraordinary to maintain those mortgage balances
because they're being offset by other – by growth in other categories.
And actually strategically we had talked about this before that we felt like our mortgage book was creeping up to a
too high of a level against our overall loan book and as things have turned out that's changed rather more rapidly
than we thought it would. And it'll probably continue to evolve at a much slower pace throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks. And one last one, maybe just on loan to values. I think that's something that a lot of other banks have
brought up relative to their CRE book. And I guess, trying to give confidence to investors that they don't see a lot
of loss content there. Do you have any of that level of disclosure maybe by sector or anything like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I think. I think the number that you'd be most interested in if you go back to the slide 8 where you see our
exposure to retailers, which is our largest sector of interest, the loan to values in the term book for retailers, and
most of it is termed, it's 57%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And would that be consistent thought with – I guess other, other areas would be higher maybe 70%, 75%,
any, any color...

[indiscernible] (00:45:32)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, it's going to depend – yeah, it would depend very much on the individual categories. But on this on this page
where we called out industries which have been impacted by COVID-19 which are 9% of our total loan book,
almost 3% of that is in the category I just, just talked about. Obviously, retail REITs are a different animal because
they're all a basket of projects. So, the LTV there [ph] is to remain (00:45:57), oil and gas is – depends on their
redeterminations. And then the rest of the exposures get pretty limited in a hurry. So, we focused in on what's the
LTV on these retailer-oriented commercial real estate projects, and it turns out it's pretty reasonable.

Michael Young Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Good afternoon, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey Chris or Phil, so, just looking at slide 18 on the guidance on the on the fee income, isolating the mortgage
component, can you provide a little more perspective on the magnitude of pressure from some of the actions
you're taking to waive fees and also kind of the market impact on your wealth business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, I mean the issue with wealth asset management, and we disclosed that number and you can see it on
page 3, wealth AUM came down by more than 15% from year end to the end of the first quarter. So that will have
a drag on those fees as we move through the year. Now some of those fees are on a lag. So they'll basically take
effect here in the second quarter based on the downdraft we saw in the first quarter. So it's going to be an impact.
With regard to the waivers and fee charges we partially disclosed that on the slide with the [indiscernible]
(00:47:48) we are doing for our customers and that's already over [indiscernible] (00:47:53). And it will likely
16


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
become more as we continue through the quarter if that's earlier we would expect there to be probably additional
requests for waivers and such over the course of the quarter and so that will likely increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Now there is the potential that a lot of this maybe all of it will be offset by the fees we ultimately collect from the
PPP program depending on what those turn out to be. I mean they're likely to be somewhere in the range, I'm
guessing, of $30 million to $40 million fees that, of course, we had in – they weren't even a figment of our
imagination at the start of the year. So that should offset, I'm guessing, quite a bit of our concern about wealth as
well as some of the waivers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Associated Banc-Corp
And just for clarity for geography those fees will show up in net interest income over the course of the next six
months likely as soon the loans come off not in fees. Just for clarity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, got it. Got it. And maybe – maybe one more if I could. So obviously dividends are a big topic in Europe and
making a way to the US. I mean you're payout ratio is not glaringly, 60% just thoughts on dividend sustainability,
given the sharp change in the macro?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Sure. So I'll give you the Jamie Dimon answer, which is we fully expect to continue to pay our dividend. We feel
comfortable that we should be able to. But if we end up in a severe prolonged recession, you know almost
anything is on the table for almost any company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
