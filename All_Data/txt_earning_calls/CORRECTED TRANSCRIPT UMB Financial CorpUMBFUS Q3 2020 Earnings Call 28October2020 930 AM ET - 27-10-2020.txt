Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we
approach the ninth month of this adjusted way of doing business at serving our customers, our systems are
performing well and we're continuing our measured approach to the return to the workplace. We had a multi-
phase plan and currently have about 18% of our non-branch associates in our corporate facilities. The majority of
our associate base still remains remote. We continue to meet with our customers and our branches by
appointment or through our drive-up operations at most locations. Our teams are very adept at virtual meetings
and have had success with calling efforts. But I know we'll all be ready for an eventual return to in-person
interactions and a handshake.
These times have reinforced what we've always known; relationships matter. I'm extremely proud and impressed
with how our associates continue to adapt, while maintaining those relationships with our customers and each
other. Doing what's right to support our workforce, customers, and communities is one of our priorities, along with
maintaining our high quality underwriting standards and solid capital and liquidity levels. Our third quarter results
reflect those priorities with net charge-offs of just 0.13% of total loans, improving past due trends and double-digit
year-over-year growth on both sides of the balance sheet.
On the credit front, provision for the quarter was $16 million, reflecting the quality of our loan book and a reduction
in modified loan balances. Third quarter provision represents 3.1 times net charge-offs of $5.1 million. The
reserve build in the third quarter brings our total allowance for credit losses on loans to $211.7 million at
September 30, with an allowance to loan coverage of 1.33%. Excluding PPP loans, that coverage is 1.46%, or
nearly two times what it was at yearend 2019 prior to the adoption of CECL. Total reserves were $214.5 million or
2.2 times nonperforming assets, compared to the peer median of 1.7 times, based on those who have reported
today.
We expect the bulk of our reserve build maybe behind us. Our portfolio is well-positioned and we haven't seen
material signs of deterioration in our markets to-date. However, there are several significant factors including the
election, the next round of stimulus, and the duration of the pandemic that will impact the economy and our
borrowers. This underscores the importance of our strong credit and capital position. During the quarter, we
completed our first subordinated debt issuance with $200 million or 3.7% [ph] fixed-to-fix (04:54) rate notes. The
opportunity to bring in this Tier 2 capital at an attractive rate strengthens our already solid capital levels and
reduces our overall cost of capital.
Our total risk-based capital ratios improved 100 basis points to 14.17% for the third quarter. Our top priority for
use of capital remains organic growth, as we have opportunities for deeper penetration in many of our markets
and lending verticals. And as market conditions allow, we'll continue to look for the opportunities to augment that
growth with strategic acquisitions.
Returning capital to our shareholders has long been important to us, and as stated in the press release, the Board
just approved a 3.2% dividend increase payable in January. Another anecdote I'll share today is that next spring
marks our 50th anniversary of our listing on the Nasdaq. We went public in 1971 and have paid a dividend for
each of the past 49 years. More recently, we've increased our annual dividend interrupted since 2002, that's 19
years of increases, even through the Great Recession, for a total increase of nearly 229%. That's something I'm
very proud of.
Now, moving back to our results, we posted net income of $73.1 million or $1.52 per share for the third quarter.
Pre-tax, pre-provision income of $99.4 million represents a 10.2% increase over the linked-quarter and a 23.5%

increase compared to the third quarter of 2019. Total fee income was strong at $113 million. The quarter-over-
quarter decrease of $7.5 million was largely driven by market-related adjustments, including COLI valuations,
along with decreased gains on sale of securities.
But we had positive trends in the trust and securities processing line and card spending volume increased from
the lower levels in the second quarter, driving improved interchange income. Ram will share more details on
those drivers shortly. Net interest income increased 3.5% from the second quarter, as we posted strong loan
volumes and growth in the AFS book. While lower deposits and borrowing costs helped us partially mitigate
reduced earning asset yields.
Despite these unprecedented times, average loans, excluding PPP balances, increased 9.4% on a linked-quarter
annualized basis. And I'll note that we surpassed, for the first time, $30 billion in assets. New loan production
outside of PPP was $924 million, the highest origination level year-to-date. Commercial line utilization remains
stable from the prior quarter at 31%. This is similar to the recent averages after the spike in March and April.
Average loan growth was again driven largely by commercial and consumer real estate. Last quarter, I mentioned
the mortgage prequalification applications hit record highs, and we saw some of that in resulting growth with
average consumer real estate loans increasing 14.8% linked quarter.
Our loan portfolio remains diverse and well-balanced across several product lines, geographies, and industries.
Total composition is shown on slide 20, followed by loan activity during the quarter and breakdowns of our
commercial portfolio by asset class. Our $1.5 billion PPP loan portfolio is shown by industry and geography on
slide 24. We're preparing to accept forgiveness applications in the next few days.
On slide 25, you'll see updated our exposure to sensitive industries. At June 30, we reported that approximately
10.3% of our total loans, excluding PPP balances, were in what we call a potentially more impacted category. At
the end of September, that was down to 9.6%.
Total loans in these categories are $2.6 billion, representing 17.7% of our loan portfolio. However, after analysis,
we feel that approximately $1.4 billion or 9.6% could possibly carry more risk since if the crisis is prolonged. We
are closely monitoring these relationships and have regular communication with these borrowers. The granular
look at these loan types is included in the loan risk table on page 27 in the asset quality section. This data shows
the quality of our loan portfolio and contains details on our modified loans by category. On the following slide,
you'll see that we have a reduction of more than 47% in modified loan balances compared to the second quarter.
As you recall, based on an initial request, we approved approximately $2.1 billion in modifications. However,
many of those were ultimately not needed by the customers. At September 30, loan modification balances had
dropped to $698 million or 4.8% of loans, down from $1.3 billion or 9.6% of loans last quarter. And if you exclude
the portion related to our business banking portfolio, we had just $322 million remaining.
In business banking, which includes our practice solution clients. largely dental offices, we proactively offer six
month deferrals, many were made in April and May. Therefore, the deferrals are scheduled to expire during the
fourth quarter. We expect the vast majority of our clients to return to normal payment status and early indications
are very positive.
Finally, as you may have seen in our press release early last week, we're excited about a recent success story in
our small business investment company, UMB Capital Corporation. Our $7 million investment in Ittella
International initiated in 2019, resulted in a 7% ownership stake in Tattooed Chef following its IPO which was

completed on October 15. This is truly a lifecycle investment for us showcasing the capabilities of our capital
finance division. Our relationship with Ittella began in our asset-based lending group and we were able to partner
with them as they grew. Our capabilities allow us to meet a variety of capital needs for our clients at each stage of
development, from mezzanine to working capital.
In closing, I reiterate that we continue to manage for the long-term with a strong capital and liquidity position, a
history of prudent risk management, and diverse revenue sources. This helps provide buffers in the interest rate
environment, and serves us well as we navigate through the crisis.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Ram. Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Looking at the quarterly results, net interest income of $184.4 million represents an increase
of $6.2 million from the second quarter driven by strong growth in C&I and CRE loans and a larger AFS portfolio.
Total earning asset yields fell 10 basis points to 2.91% from the linked quarter driven by yield declines of 13 basis
points in both loans and total securities.
Net interest spread decreased 4 basis points from the second quarter and was down only 1 basis point from a
year ago. Net interest margin compressed by 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Drivers of this change
included negative 4 basis points from lower reinvestment rates and market changes to the AFS portfolio, a 3 basis
point reduction from the reduced benefit of free funds, and negative 2 basis points related to earning asset mix
shift, partially offset by a 3 basis point impact from deposit mix along with CD and money market rate changes.
Liquidity levels remain elevated and consistent with the second quarter levels at over 2.3 times level seen a year
ago. As we noted in the release, we terminated our $750 million interest rate floor hedge for $34.1 million during
the third quarter. The unrealized gain remaining in AOCI was $18.4 million, which will be amortized into net
interest income through September of 2024.
Noninterest income, as shown on slide 9, was $113 million for the quarter, a reduction of $7.5 million. Valuation
adjustments and company-owned life insurance income accounted for $6.2 million of the sequential decline. This
decrease is offset by a similar decrease in deferred compensation expense. Gains on sale of securities accounted
for an additional $3.7 million decline from the linked quarter.
We saw improved trends in asset servicing with our alternative investment, registered funds administration, and
custody businesses driving the largest portion of the $4.2 million increase in trust and securities processing
income. Bankcard fees improved 18.4% or $2.4 million from the second quarter driven by a 21% linked-quarter
increase in card spending volume.
We've seen spending levels improve from April lows, but they remain below pre-pandemic levels. We believe
there has been some catch-up in routine medical and dental care following the shutdowns earlier in the year and
healthcare spending surpassed year-over-year levels. Commercial credit purchase volumes improved 24% over
the second quarter, but are still below prior-year levels with corporate travel and entertainment still on hold for
many companies.
Public sector spending is down due to significant decreases in new fiscal year budgets, and many schools across
our footprint are either not open or at limited capacity. The $4.2 million linked-quarter reduction in investment
banking fee income was driven largely by lower municipal and corporate bond volumes after a very strong second

quarter. Additionally, market valuation adjustments in our trading portfolio accounted for $1.9 million of the
decrease.
Beginning in the fourth quarter, our fee income will be subject to some volatility from market value adjustments to
our position in Tattooed Chef. As part of the transaction, we received $9 million in cash and just over 4 million
shares of TTCF, a publicly traded entity. Changes in market values on our share ownership will flow through our
income statement as unrealized gains or losses at each reporting period. Based on recent trading levels, our
fourth quarter gains may be approximately $68 million to $70 million, but obviously will be adjusted to reflect the
stock price at quarter-end.
Expenses for the quarter decreased 5.1% or $10.5 million compared to the second quarter largely driven by an $8
million decrease in deferred compensation expense, the offset to the decreased COLI income I mentioned.
Further detail is shown on slide 12. The tax rate for the quarter was 12.3% and for the full year 2020, we
anticipate it will be approximately 14% to 15%.
Moving to the balance sheet, average deposits increased 5.9% on a linked quarter basis and DDA balances grew
by 7.8%. Free funds now comprised just over 34% of total deposits. We continue to maintain strong regulatory
capital ratios bolstered by the sub debt offering during the quarter with our total risk-based capital at 14.17%,
CET1 ratio at 11.93%, and a leverage ratio at 8.19%. Tangible common equity to assets was 8.8%. Trends in our
capital ratios are shown on slide 15. Our tangible book value per share increased to $55.19 at the end of the
quarter, up 14.5% from a year ago. For comparison, our peers that have reported so far have shown an increase
of 5.9%.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today
comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Ram. Good morning, Mariner. Nice quarter overall. I'm hoping to talk a little bit about
expenses to start. You guys had them pretty well-controlled this quarter. But rereading the transcript from last
quarter, you talked about just a really big focus on expenses given the revenue environment. Interested in your
thoughts about expenses? Investments you may need to make and potential sources of rationalizations to 2021.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. This is Mariner. Thanks for the question. As we've been talking the last few quarters, we remain very
focused on being an efficient company. And we've undertaken over time any number of exercises, but really it's
more the way we're operating and we are able to – with digitization and acceptance of digitization from the
customer base, we've been able to continue to find efficiencies through the use of technology. We continue to
manage staffing levels based on performance and continue to look at our physical plant. And you should expect
us to continue to focus on expenses without giving you any particular guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe just on one line item and in the expenses – the personnel number, Ram, was somewhat high in the last
couple of quarters. I'm interested how much of that was kind of a catch up from really low first quarter and bonus
accruals and maybe that line item? Is that – in this [indiscernible] (19:51) is that a decent jumping off point to kind
of forecast growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. The one thing that flows through that line item is also our deferred comp expense, right. So quarter-over-
quarter, we saw some movement over there depending on what happens with the market, but usually there's
equal offset on the COLI side. So if you look at just what happened this particular quarter, we have deferred comp
expenses of just under $4 million, which was down about $8 million from the prior quarter. But if you exclude that
noise, there's always the usual seasonal resets and FICA.
But the overall incentives were just impacted by some of the trading volumes that you see – the bond trading has
been a pretty strong headline for us. Other fee income opportunities have also been a strong headline. So
anything volume related will always increase salaries from one period to another period. But these salaries, just

when you look at salaries and wages, what you see in the fourth quarter is probably a good starting point enter
2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And if I could just on a couple of modeling questions, the PPP. Can you let us know what was in the
quarter for the fees, what remains and then yes I guess into 2021 like a cadence of the fees?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Ram, do you take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. I'll take that. So what's in our fees right now is just a plain vanilla finance charge of 1% and the amortization
of the origination fee. As you know, as Mariner said, we'll be or we're gearing up to take forgiveness applications.
And so none of that is really in our fee income – or net interest income base for the third quarter. Chances are
with the way the process is playing out, there'll be a very little impact if any in the fourth quarter and most of it will
be probably in 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then on the taxes, if I could, it sounds like the fourth quarter, a little bit of a higher tax rate, Ram. And
then how do we think about the sensitivity if we do get a change in administration to some of the proposals that
are being floated in Washington with the tax hikes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Is it assumed – yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
On the first part, so we said 14% to 15%. Yes. A higher tax rate for the fourth quarter. A lot of it would depend on
our pre-tax income, as I said in my script. We might have as much as $70 million, $75 million gain from our
investment in Tattooed Chef. So when pre-tax income goes up, your tax rate – effective tax rate will also go up.
On the second part of that, if corporate tax rate went from 21% to 28%, we'll see probably about a 400 basis point
increase on our ETR when that goes into effect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Awesome. Thank you very much.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Hi, guys. Good morning.

Hey, Nate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was hoping to start on credit. It looks like this quarter [indiscernible] (22:54) was largely a function of criticized
and classified trends in the quarter. So, just curious to get a sense of how that trended during 3Q and if a lot of
that criticized and classified inflow was just concentrated in that at-risk portfolios that have been outlined in the
slide deck or if there's some other areas that also saw some inflows?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
On the provision expense, largely it is definitely based on mostly credit performance. Don't have much macro
modeling-related provision expense in the third quarter to speak of. Not much. So, it's mostly just credit
performance. And it was a good quarter from that perspective with 13 basis points in charge-offs and the typical
growth level we've been seeing. So it's nice growth from the quarter two. So performances – performance is
strong and growth is strong, and that's basically what you saw on the provision expense for the most part, if that
answers the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. That's helpful. Thanks,. Mariner. I guess I was also just hoping to get some color just in terms of broader
criticized and classified trends in the quarter. I don't think there was a slide...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure. You noticed – so they're on – you'll see this in the 10-Q, our criticized are down, so overall criticized are
slightly down. Nothing to note as it relates to overall. The way we think about all this, so NPAs ticked up slightly
but criticized in total are down. Nothing to note really. We don't expect anything different when it comes to charge-
offs in the coming periods that we don't see or expect today as we look at the data. It's the same kind of comment

I've made before, which is we'll see some spikes along the top as it relates to putting credits on the watch list or a
credit going to NPA.
As we are very quick to manage credits at UMB, we're quick to identify problems, we're quick to manage them. So
you'll see peaks and valleys along the top. But what's really important, the way we look at it and the way we think
about it is there's very little migration to doubtful and loss. And that's what we care about and that's what we think
about. And we don't expect anything different in – as far as we can see out right now as relates to migration to
doubtful and loss.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Yes, that's super helpful. And then just thinking about the margin trajectory going forward of PPPs.
Ram, any thoughts? Obviously, securities reinvestment rates are a challenge these days, but it seems like
[indiscernible] (25:50) remains pretty solid. So hopefully that change in earned assets should help going forward
but just kind of any thoughts on how you see that core margin trajectory through the fourth quarter and early
2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes, sure. I can take that. If you think about the two main reasons for margin compression today, right, as you
mentioned it's the reinvestment rates on our AFS book are lower than what's rolling off. And we have some data
in our slide deck that shows we have close to $1.7 billion of maturities coming over the next 12 months at a 1.93%
rate. And for instance, what we reinvested in September had a 1.60% handle on it, right, so there's some
compression.
And the other thing that's happening is also the earning asset mix shift, not only within the loan book but between
loans and earning assets. A lot of it is because of the liquidity bill. So the big wildcard, as you rightly pointed, will
be the pace of PPP run-offs, right. And for instance, if you assumed all our PPP balances ran off in the third
quarter and were replaced by non-PPP loans, our margin would have been 7 basis points higher this quarter.
But that's not how it's going to play out in the short run. So as PPP loans exit, we would expect our loan-to-
deposit ratio probably come down 1 point or 2, and that's going to probably drive a little bit more of the
unfavorable earning mix shift that I talked about.
And then the other wildcard is also the excess liquidity part. So while it was stable, as I said on a linked-quarter
basis, it's still about 2.5 times where it was pre-pandemic levels. And for us in our businesses, as you all know,
we'll see more liquidity in the fourth and first quarters from public funds business. So, all said, I would say I
probably expect margin to trough in the next couple of quarters, because of excess liquidity and this other PPP
dynamic I'm talking about. Bu what we do, we always said this in these lower rate environments – low interest rate
environments, we tend to focus on net interest income growth. So, that always will be a differentiator for us, we'll
keep the dry powder in terms of deposits to deploy later.

NII could actually decline over the coming quarters?

I mean, just based on what Ram just said, it's likely that it'll continue to increase. Just to...

Got it. And – got it. Maybe just on credit manner, if you take a step back, I know you feel very good about your
loan book, for a bank that is actually growing the loan portfolio, just talk to us as you think about the puts and
takes in terms of the macro outlook looking into the next year. Do you see – are you more worried about credit or
are you more optimistic about growth when you think about 2021?

So, Ebrahim, you know me pretty well, you've watched us for a while, I'm a career pessimist. So, we – the thing
about the way we underwrite is we're always underwriting for the next crisis. So, as it relates to how we
underwrite in general, we're always prepared for the worst. We always underwrite to the worst-case scenario. So,
we're really not doing anything different in the way that we underwrite. We're – we want to bank customers that
know that things can get bad and have built equity and have global cash flow and sponsor strength and all those
kinds of things. People that – we bank people who believe what we believe is that we believe in gravity. We
believe that what goes up must come down. And so, we're always underwriting that way. So, we don't wait for a
crisis to operate like there's a crisis.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
And so, as we think of the first quarter, a couple of comments – first quarter and second quarter, a couple
comments I would make about our outlook for that. You know, I don't – we don't believe that the economy cares
who the President is. We also don't believe that we're going to go into the New Year without another stimulus
package. And so, we believe that there'll be stimulus and we don't believe that the markets care who is President.
What we worry about is if the coronavirus pandemic were to get worse, that would likely apply some pressure to
our more sensitive impacted credit list that we've provided for you, the investor community. So, that's what we
worry about. We – I think that as it relates to the rest of our book, I think we'll go on into the next year
uninterrupted for the – with the rest of the – with the book. But as it relates to some of those industries that we've
identified that are sensitive to the pandemic, we would likely see some stress there. However, I would revert back
to my original comment, which is that when we originated those credits, we originated them knowing that things
could get worse.
And so, we assess global cash flow, sponsor strength, loan to values, location, cap rates. We're very conservative
about the way we look at those things. And so, we know that there – while there will be stress, we don't worry
particularly about higher than normal loss levels.
