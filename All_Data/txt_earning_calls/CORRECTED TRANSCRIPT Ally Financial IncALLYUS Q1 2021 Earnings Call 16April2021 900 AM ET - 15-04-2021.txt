Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Great. Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. We recognize it's
a busy morning with a few of us out with results. So, we appreciate you being here. I'm going to begin comments
on slide number 4. As we convened this call a year ago, we were obviously in the early days of the COVID-19
health crisis that has taken the lives of many loved ones, altered everyday norms and shed an unfortunate but
necessary light on growing economic disparities. Today, through the diligent work and coordination across health
and public sectors, vaccine rollouts are accelerating, providing increased reason for optimism and our ability to
contain the spread of this deadly virus.
Likewise, early signs of a broad-based economic reopening in the US continue to emerge, evidenced in the
outlook for strong GDP growth, ongoing gains and employment levels and expanding consumer confidence and
spending. We've also seen increased focus and action across the private sector in addressing income disparity
and underlying systemic racism, even though more work remains to be done in the years ahead.
Over the past many months, I've expressed the view on several occasions that Ally would successfully navigate
the complex environment and emerge stronger than before by relying on a consistent set of values and executing.
Ally's first quarter operating and financial results put meaning to these words, demonstrating the value we are
building for all of our stakeholders as we deliver on our mission to do it right for our customers, employees and
communities.
Ally's success has always been defined by our relentless customer focus and the vibrancy of our culture. Over
many decades, we have built dominant, adaptable businesses within the auto and digital banking ecosystems
firmly centered around our customers. Efforts to build the largest auto and digital bank platforms have
underpinned significant and sustained financial improvements in enabling us to capitalize on market opportunities
in real time, which again we'll talk about in detail this morning.
Our purpose to help customers achieve their financial goals through seamless, innovative financial products and
services is evident in everything we do and was paramount throughout the pandemic, shown in the rollout of our
comprehensive relief programs and access to credit we provided to all of our consumer and commercial clients.
Maintaining our culture has always been a top priority, centered around an environment of inclusivity and
protecting the wellbeing of our employees. Over the past year, this approach has taken on a variety of new forms,
including expansion of health, family and financial benefits for our people, dynamically adjusting to virtual and
hybrid work environments and relying on our employee resource groups to facilitate crucial conversations and
connect with each other as we confront the disturbing realities of systemic racism and disparate treatment among
black, brown and, most recently, Asian communities.
I am immensely proud of how our Ally teammates have responded to each of these challenges, remaining
dedicated during times of great uncertainty and instability while consistently going above and beyond to deliver for
our customers. For the second year in a row, we granted all employees with 100 shares of Ally stock, referred to
internally as the Own It Grant. Through this action, we are acknowledging the significant contribution each of our
employees continues to make while embedding an onerous mentality across the entire organization.
On social and community causes, we've expanded our ability to drive impact across our leadership teams and
through the ALLY Foundation, an office of diversity and inclusion. During the quarter, we marked our 15th year of
partnership with the Thurgood Marshall Foundation by increasing scholarships and grant moneys, focused on
improving access to public policy and financial service industries. Each of these critical components contributes to

our ongoing success and generates long-term value for all of our stakeholders. There's excitement at Ally in the
success we've generated in the path in front of us as we continue to further leverage our scale and expertise in
meeting the needs of our now 9 million and growing ally customers.
Turning to slide number 5. First quarter adjusted EPS of $2.09, core ROTCE of 24.1% and revenues of $1.9
billion, each represented record-setting levels for Ally, reflecting organic and diversified revenue expansion.
Within auto finance, consumer originations of $10.2 billion represented our highest level in over five years at a
healthy 7.2% yield while the credit performance remains solid. These are powerful examples of our market-
leading capabilities and ability to execute on our strategic priorities.
Overall demand for new and used vehicles was robust during the quarter, while competition remained balanced
but intense. Industry inventory levels reached multi-decade lows as sales trends were strong. And we began to
see the early impact of constrained OEM production due to chip-related shortages. These dynamics provided
structural support for used car values, which remained at or near record highs. Within insurance, written
premiums of $333 million moved higher year-over-year. And investment portfolio revenue trends remain robust.
Turning to Ally Bank. The trend of organic and accelerating growth continued in the quarter. Retail deposits ended
at $128 billion, including customer expansion of 14%, extending the trend of double-digit year-over-year growth
every quarter since watching Ally Bank in 2009. Ally Home originations of $1.8 billion improved nearly 2.5 times
compared to the prior-year period. 45% of originated volume was sourced from existing deposit customers,
highlighting our organic opportunity to build increased scale in this core consumer bank product.
Ally Invest self-directed customer assets of $14.5 billion expanded 93% year-over-year, reflecting customer
inflows and market activity. The team showed resiliency and dedication in a choppy environment, generating
steady customer growth and supporting historically-elevated daily trading activities.
Ally Lending performance was strong during the quarter, as we generated $211 million of volume, nearly a
threefold increase year-over-year. We expect to officially launch our retail offering here in the second quarter,
enhancing our ability to sustain our momentum in this rapidly-growing market.
Corporate Finance financial results were solid, generating strong syndication income and $1.8 billion in loan
commitments, our highest first quarter ever. The outlook for each of these businesses reflects years of steady
execution and ongoing discipline, which positions us to achieve our near- and long-term financial and strategic
objectives.
On slide number 6, trends on the top of the page highlight our ability to generate strong earnings and revenues
and indicate the rapid resumption of the improving financial trajectory we were on entering 2020. As we
highlighted in the past, we are not overly focused on quarter-to-quarter trends, which we expect will not always
move in a linear manner as our focus is centered on long-term value enhancement.
On the bottom right, tangible book value per share of $36.16 increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to
our highest level on record. The values, culture and disciplined execution will continue to underpin our approach
as we build upon our momentum in the years ahead.
Thank you. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Jenn to go through the detailed results.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a few broad perspective on our leading differentiated
capabilities that have positioned us for the future and allowed us to generate a strong first quarter, including our
highest PPNR and operating income.
Starting first within our auto segment on slide 7. We built an agile and resilient business, delivering
comprehensive products and services. Our market leadership has grown consistently over the past decade,
including an over 50% increase in dealer relationships to 19,000, an application volume at the highest levels in
Ally's history. Our broad-based distribution across emerging and traditional dealers provides us real-time insight in
the opportunities to optimize volume with risk return dynamics. The powerful combination of our highly skilled field
teams and evolving technology platforms, including auto decision capabilities, ensure we deliver a streamlined
experience to a broad range of dealers and consumers. Over the past year, we have deployed several digital
consumer portals and converted to a modernized retail auto servicing system, evidence of the end-to-end
enhancements and data-driven approach.
Turning to the industry. Personal vehicle ownership offers critical utility to consumers, reflected in the large,
resilient and growing auto market. Ally has a lengthy track record of adapting to shifting market dynamics,
including a seamless transition to increase used vehicle demand, a trend we expect to continue. And while recent
credit trends have been positively impacted by stimulus, auto consistently ranks near the top of the consumer
payment waterfall, a trend that has persisted across several cycles, reflecting the strong value of the secured
asset class.
Turning to slide 8. Several years of steady broad-based consumer adoption of digital banking accelerated in
2020, as demand increased for personalized experiences delivered seamlessly and instantly. As the largest all-
digital bank in the US, Ally is uniquely positioned to benefit from this ongoing evolution. We've consistently grown
retail balances and customers at Ally Bank for 48 consecutive quarters and are increasingly leveraging the
success as the gateway to our rapidly-expanding mortgage, invest and point-of-sale offerings. The strong growth
trends across each of these relevant and core consumer bank products demonstrate the meaningful expansion
opportunity ahead.
Let's turn to slide 9 to review detailed results for the quarter. Net financing revenue excluding OID of $1.382 billion
represents our highest quarterly level, increasing 5% linked quarter and 20% year-over-year. Performance was
driven by sustained auto pricing trends and strong used car values, ongoing funding cost declines and benefits
associated with redeployment of excess liquidity. Adjusted other revenue of $548 million reflected another solid
quarter of investment income and diversified revenue growth from our insurance, smart option, mortgage and
invest businesses.
Provision expense reflects the combined benefit of a modest reserve reduction, given ongoing economic
improvement and strong consumer payment activity. Retail auto charge-offs reached the lowest level since 2012.
Non-interest expense of $943 million reflected a continued focus on essentialism across the enterprise, as well as
investments in business growth and new capabilities. We generated $1 billion of core pre-tax earnings this
quarter, driving GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.11 and $2.09, respectively, a resounding testament to several
years of diligent focus and execution.
Moving to slide 10. Net interest margin excluding OID was 3.18%, an increase of 26 basis points linked quarter
and 50 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight Ally's unique and embedded tailwinds that will drive
ongoing NIM expansion over the next several quarters. Earning asset yield of 4.44% improved 10 basis points
quarter-over-quarter, reflecting resilient retail auto pricing trends and origination volume, strong lease portfolio
yields from elevated used car values as vehicle inventories declined from solid demand and slower production

trends and the associated benefits of redeploying excess liquidity into higher earning investment securities, given
rising benchmarks.
Based on strong demand trends, we now expect retail origination yields in the 7% range throughout the remainder
of the year and given ongoing production uncertainties with the used car values increasing in the mid-single digits
for full year 2021. Average earning assets of $176 billion moved slightly lower quarter-over-quarter as dealer
floorplan levels declined and mortgage prepayments remained elevated. Notably, we generated growth across all
of our remaining loan and lease portfolios during the quarter. Cost of funds improved 17 basis points, the seventh
consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline, reflecting improved deposit costs and ongoing wholesale funding
optimization.
Let's turn to slide 11. Total deposits ended at $140 billion. Retail growth of $4 billion was fueled by existing
customer balance growth and inflows from 83,000 new customers. Customer trends were strong across all
measures. Retention remained industry leading at 96%. Customer growth from younger generations early in their
financial journeys with a higher propensity for digitally-based products represented nearly 70% of new customers.
And multi-relationship customers shown in the bottom right grew to 8%, representing the 16th consecutive quarter
of growth.
Turning to capital on slide 12. CET1 ended the quarter at 11.1%, reflecting strong earnings and slightly lower risk-
weighted assets. Earlier this week, we announced the Q2 common dividend of $0.19 per share. And we resumed
our share buyback program in Q1, executing $219 million of repurchases. We remain on track to achieve our $1.6
billion board-authorized plan during 2021.
With the SEB framework set to go into effect beginning July 1, Ally's strong capital levels and earnings trends
position us well moving forward. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent, centered around
investing in growth opportunities across our businesses, delivering innovative and differentiated products and
driving long-term shareholder value.
On slide 13, asset quality remains very strong. Trends across our consumer and commercial portfolios were
resilient as consolidated NCOs of 41 basis points represented less than half the prior-year level. Retail auto
portfolio trends improved considerably quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year as charge-offs of $97 million or 53
basis points reflected solid consumer payment trends and improved loss given default rate. Aiding these results
were the benefits of a third round of stimulus and ongoing government support, serving as a bridge for consumers
facing hardship. In the bottom right, early- and late-stage delinquencies ended meaningfully below prior-year
levels, a positive leading indicator for near-term loss trend.
Turning to slide 14. Consolidated coverage remained relatively flat at 2.79% as retail auto and Ally Lending
balances grew and floorplan balances which carry significantly lower coverage levels declined. Retail auto
reserves of $2.8 billion moved modestly lower, reflecting favorable credit trends and improved macroeconomic
indicators. Our modeled forecast assumes gradually improving unemployment through the end of this year,
ending at just above 5%. And while we are encouraged by underlying trends across our portfolios and early signs
of economic improvements are beginning to emerge, we remain well positioned for ongoing uncertainty. We
believe we are carrying sufficient reserves should NCOs exceed normalized levels due to the pandemic-related
activity.
Let's turn to slide 15 to review auto segment highlights. Net financing revenue expanded quarter-over-quarter and
year-over-year from ongoing strength in our retail and lease portfolios. Retail trends shown in the bottom left
demonstrate the consistently strong origination and portfolio yield trends where risk-adjusted margins continue to

expand. And in the bottom right, per unit gains maintained strong overall levels, leading to $64 million in overall
lease gains. Our focused and differentiated approach to meeting the needs of our dealers and customers drove
$803 million in pre-tax income for the segment and improved risk-adjusted returns.
Origination and auto asset trends are on slide 16. We have continually provided broad access to credit for
consumers, utilizing our disciplined and dynamic underwriting approach while maintaining consistent FICO and
nonprime trends. Auto originations of $10.2 billion in the quarter increased $1.1 billion year-over-year and
represented our highest Q1 in a decade. In the bottom left, ending consumer asset expanded to $83.8 billion with
growth across retail and lease portfolios. On the bottom right, average commercial assets ended at $21.3 billion
as inventory levels reached the 10-year low. We expect floorplan balances to remain low for the next several
quarters, reflecting strong demand for vehicles and persistent shipping component shortages that are likely to
weigh on factory output.
Turning to insurance results on slide 17. Core pre-tax income of $130 million increased sequentially and year-
over-year. In the bottom left, consistent investment portfolio growth creates a diversified revenue stream and
enhances segment returns. Written premiums of $333 million reflected strong F&I trends. And we generated the
highest monthly level of vehicle service contract sales since 2013. While we've seen a steady rise in extreme
weather events over the past several years, we have mitigated our exposure through reinsurance and
renegotiated our policy for 2021 at favorable economic terms.
Turning to corporate finance details on slide 18. Core income of $48 million reflected quarter-over-quarter asset
expansion, strong syndication and investment income and stable credit trends. HFI ending balances of $6.3 billion
increased linked quarter, while the year-over-year decline reflected the elevated draw activity observed early in
the pandemic. Loan commitment volume of $1.8 billion represented the highest Q1 on record and our third
highest quarter ever.
While utilization levels remain low in the quarter, we're well positioned for loan growth moving forward. We are
confident in the strength of our portfolio, evidenced by sustained credit performance and the continued increase in
asset-based loans which now comprise 52% of our portfolio, up from 25% in 2014.
Mortgage details are on slide 19. Pre-tax income for the segment of $23 million grew quarter-over-quarter and
year-over-year, as gain on sale economics remained strong, more than offsetting the ongoing impact of elevated
prepayment activity. Direct-to-consumer originations of $1.8 billion was our highest quarterly volume since
launching in 2016. Existing deposit customers represented 45% of volume in the quarter, demonstrating the high
quality nature of our engaged customer base. We see a steady path to $10 billion in originations over the next
couple of years as we build scale for existing and new customers. Our all-digital offering allows customers to
complete an application in 5 minutes and lock their rate in 10 minutes.
On slide 20, we've included a refreshed view of our financial outlook, given the strong results we've delivered in
Q1. We now expect ROTCE expansion into the mid-teens to accelerate into 2021, excluding the impact of reserve
release. Our long-term returns will be driven by ongoing momentum across our businesses, embedded balance
sheet tailwinds and organic growth across our product offerings. Revenue growth and disciplined expense
increases will lead to improved PPNR and operating leverage in the 10% range for 2021. NIM expansion to the
low- to mid-3% range will drive net financing revenue growth in the 20% range year-over-year. We continue to
embed a consistent expectation for steady other revenue growth sourced from our broader set of consumer
offerings and ongoing insurance activities. And as we've noted in the past, we embed modest investment gains in
our forecast, though we remain opportunistic and disciplined in our approach. We're proud of the value and
growth generated across all our businesses, driving near- and long-term benefits for our stakeholders.

Thank you very much, Jenn. I want to wrap up with a few comments on slide number 21. I want to express my
gratitude and the deep sense of pride I have in leading this great company. Our results this quarter are
impressive. But our broader purpose and cause to serve our customers and communities is what defines the
long-term success that remains in front of us. I'm entirely confident in our ability to navigate and win through a
variety of environments and market backdrops. And I think, if you look at the past several quarters, we're really

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Good morning. The NIM outlook seems to keep getting better. Can you parse out for us how much of the
improvement is coming from various drivers, including the scaling of some of your smaller businesses and maybe
if you could speak to the sustainability?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I'll jump in, Bill, and good morning. Yes, our NIM outlook continues to be very strong, evidenced in
this quarter and ongoing through 2021 and beyond [indiscernible] (00:28:13) some of the key drivers. On the
asset side of the balance sheet, we have continued to outperform pricing expectations and retail auto origination
flows. If you look at just this quarter, the $10.2 billion in retail auto origination is coming in above 7% yield. And
we're now expecting 2021 to have our fourth consecutive quarter of new origination yields at that 7% or above.
So, that's a big driver of sustaining the asset yield over time and then potentially even growing that a bit. And I
would offer just some of the other drivers there. Our Ally Lending portfolio continues to grow. That's coming in at a
nice yield. And we continue to see opportunities to put cash to work and loan growth across other categories as
well. So, great trajectory on the assets side.
And then, on the liability side, really two drivers there. One is the continued optimization of pricing within our
deposit portfolio. So, you see the roll forward on the OSA, but we don't have CDs rolling down. We'll have another
kind of $9 billion this year rolling off at over 150 basis points, down to under 1%. So, really nice continued
trajectory within the kind of the deposit business. And then, you have the mix shift as we roll down other funding
types, whether that's FHLB continuing to roll down or broker deposits rolling down. So, we'd expect another
several quarters of reduced cost of funds.
And so, that kind of wraps it up. I think we're well on our way. And I think – I started on pages 7 and 8 just talking
about how this is really 10 years in the making. And what we're really experiencing in 2021 and beyond is just a
roll forward of the strength we have in all of our dominant businesses and then, to your point, in some of the
newer segments as well with Ally Lending and Ally Home.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
That's helpful. Thanks. And, Jenn, I wanted to follow up on your comments around capital. How important do you
think the new SEB framework is to getting to your target level of capital relatively quickly? Maybe you can just
frame for us what kind of trajectory we should expect it – for it to take – for you guys to get back down to that sort
of 9% CET1 range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, a couple of things. I'd say, just in the near term, we're not really limited by the extension of the
repurchase, the fourth quarter earnings test or even kind of the dividend capture because earnings are so strong.
We'll have about $500 million in capacity in terms of repurchases. So, continuing to like our trajectory towards that
$1.6 billion program that or up to $1.6 billion that our board has authorized.
And then, Bill, we like the SCB framework just because it gives us more flexibility around distribution. But
honestly, we would be revisiting capital distribution even without the SCB framework. But again, anytime you have
more flexibility in how you distribute capital, that's a net plus for us. And then, as we look at our total capital levels,
we're over 11%. We do expect that to come down. And quite honestly, it's going to take some time. We'll execute
9

our current program and revisit opportunities starting first with the customers and growing our businesses. And
we'll look at excess capital through repurchases and potentially increases in dividend as well. So it's – but
honestly, Bill, it's going to take some time for that 11% to roll down to 9%.

Good morning. So, JB, you talked in December about the need for OEMs to pick up production. Now, we're
obviously going through this global chip shortage. And, Jenn mentioned, you expect floorplan balances to remain
low for the next few quarters. Could you maybe just talk about what you're seeing there? And do you think we've
actually – we bottomed on balances? And maybe can you just talk about growth outside of dealer? Can we see
mortgage start to level off as we start to see prepayment speeds slow? And just how are you thinking about
growth for the other asset categories on the balance sheet?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yeah. So, why don't – on the OEM point, yeah, we've been fairly vocal on this for a while. I mean, first, you had
the impacts and implications of COVID and factory shutdowns. And so, already, you were running pretty light
inventories. And then, there's been a variety of factors that have kind of exacerbated problems here, chip
shortages, trucking shortages, Texas weather events. And it's pretty amazing how some of these kinks in a supply
chain can really further disrupt. And so, productions slowly starting to improve. But similar to Jenn's last
comments on capital, I think it's going to take a while before this really gets normalized. So, I suspect we're at or
around the bottom on floorplan. But I don't see balances really meaningfully rising until probably the back half of
this year at best. So, that's probably one of the weak points overall right now. It's a bit out of our control. But
obviously, as we're pointing out, this leads to really strong used car markets. And obviously, we've been
originating north of 50% in used for quite some time here. And so, I think our positioning in the business is holding
really well. But it's going to take some while – it's going to take some time before inventory gets back up.
And I do also think a bright spot is consumers want to spend. I mean, production [indiscernible] (00:34:36) and in
fact, I was on the phone yesterday with Rick Hendrick and talking through kind of what they're experiencing. And
new cars would hit any other dealers. And Rick has got about 100 stores. I mean, they're selling within a day or
two. And so, you've got this slow production but pretty vicious and aggressive demand out of the consumer. So,
it's just going to take a while for things to normalize there.
But as you point out, some of the growth businesses are being a nice offset to that. And I think, as we do look at –
it's been a pretty aggressive refi environment and mortgage environment. But Jenn highlighted, we feel like we've
got a path to really ramp up originations there. So, there are certainly offsets in the balance sheet that can enable
us to continue to grow.
Jenn, what else would you want to highlight?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the only other thing [indiscernible] (00:35:33) – great job, JB. The only other thing I'd highlight,
Ryan, is just that the auto inventory phenomenon is really demand-driven. It's not that – it's like in credit cards and
some other consumer asset classes where you're seeing a slowdown in demand. So, I think that's a net plus as
we think about the consumer. And then, really, for Ally, it's a win either way. If we continue to see inventory levels
lower than expected, we see the offset in used vehicle pricing as well as in terms of benefits to LGD and our loss
estimates. And then, if we do see inventory pick up, we can put cash to work and grow NII and NIM from that. So,
net-net, it's a kind of a win-win either way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q

Great. And if I could ask one follow-up. When I think about all the pieces that you moved through, Jenn, on the
net interest margin, it feels like you have a lot of levers with upside to auto yields. Securities yields can expand.
There's cash deployment. There's also funding levers. So, it feels like getting to that mid-3s should be more than
achievable. Can you maybe just talk through if we do start to get higher rates as the market seems to be pricing
in? Can you just talk about the sustainability to those margin trends? And if we are to get a margin in the mid-3s,
could we maybe even have some a little bit of upside to the return targets over time? Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yeah. Sure. And I think you hit on it, Ryan. I mean, number one, this is pretty much baked. And it's reflective of
pages 7 and 8, right? We've been at this for 10 years. And it's largely roll forward at this point in time. And as we
think about rates potentially rising kind of back half of 2022 and into 2023, we do see that that's sustainable. I
mean, we think deposit betas will move pretty slowly. We do see continued opportunities to optimize yield and
flows in the retail auto space as well as our new businesses coming online as well as, as you point out, the ability
to redeploy cash into investment securities at higher rates.
So, number one, absolutely, this is kind of roll forward. Number two, even in a rising rate environment, we see
NIM expansion. And then, number three, we kind of debated the size of the plus in our 2021 guide on page 20
here to your point that, yeah, there is opportunity to outperform. And it's kind of across the entire income
statement, it's revenue growth as well as outperformance on credit as well.

Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Two questions. First, more technical, on funding, we were just going through that. But could you ever imagine
getting to 100% deposit funding? Would that be something that you would want to do? Or will you always keep a
little bond out there just to keep that channel open?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think, Betsy, we want to be diversified in terms of our funding mix. And we really like the trajectory
we're on in terms of continuing to increase that percent of deposits. But we'd always want to have some access to
market funding just from a resiliency perspective. And we do still have the opportunity kind of within the four walls
of deposits to bring down that brokered deposit percentage. Year-over-year, it's down about $5 billion or so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, bigger picture, when I talk to my colleagues on the auto side and the auto team here, we're
always talking about what's going on with EVs and how that industry is under such pressure from investors to get
more green and climate friendly and blah, blah, blah. So, I'm just wondering – I'm sure this is something that's in
your discussion in your boardroom conversations. How are you thinking about the EV push? How are you thinking
12

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
about how you're positioned for it right now today? Anything you need to do for or with your dealers to migrate?
And anything you can help us understand as to what you're doing on this front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Betsy, I appreciate the question. And absolutely, this is a really important discussion across the
industry, in our boardroom and our management team. And as we think about EV, we think we're really well
positioned, right? We are underwriting those loans, leases and insurance for vehicles no matter what kind of
vehicle they are. And so, as EV becomes a bigger percent of the market, we are absolutely positioned to take
advantage of that. And we kind of hit our highest level of EV originations this quarter. So, we will continue to grow
with the market. And we think we're really well positioned.
And I think, in terms of capabilities, I think we're pretty much there. Probably, we'll learn a bit more as we continue
to underwrite these types of vehicles, understanding LGD, understanding on the insurance side kind of what do
claims look like. But I think we're really, really well positioned.
And, JB, do you want to add anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Jenn, I think you hit the high point for me. Betsy, obviously, you're aware of a lot of the OEMs are pointing
to kind of 2035 as a pretty big inflection point. And obviously, we still think vehicles are going to get largely
distributed through the traditional dealer network today. So, I think, as Jenn points out, we're really well
positioned. We want to help lead in that regard. Obviously, it's an interesting space so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. We've gotten a couple of questions on how does this longer-term impact to used car prices with the
underlying assumption that EV autos have longer shelf life, so to speak, than combustion vehicles. Is that – I
mean, I know that's like a second or third order effect relative to where we are today and the incredibly hot
demand for auto is just really large. But is that something that you guys have talked about? And do you think that
that's a fair statement that EV shelf life is longer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. Betsy, I think it's still to be determined. I think the technology is still evolving right now. And I think
we'll learn more. And that was kind of my point around understanding LGD, just trying to understand kind of what
does this look like over time. And I think we're still in the early innings. It's about 1% of vehicle purchases right
now. So, we'll learn over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And in the meantime, the demand for cars is still extremely hot, obviously. And so, from that, last question there,
do your dealers have any line of sight for when they think demand today is going to be fulfilled? I mean, how
many months, quarters, years is it to get that demand fulfilled in the current space? Can you – do you have a
sense of that?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hey, Betsy, yeah, an interesting question. I mean, we saw strong demand for vehicles prior to COVID. And I think,
if anything, COVID, as we've been talking about the last several quarters, has really accelerated personal vehicle
ownership. And I think this is going to continue to be a strong area for the consumer. And it was before COVID
and it'll continue. So, we don't see this stopping anytime soon. And one of the data points we shared kind of early
in the deck is just how big this market is. So, even if you were to see overall consumer demand wane a bit, it's still
a large market and it's fairly fragmented. So, in spite of, kind of, changes in the consumer trends, we think we
have a lot of ability to continue to originate in that $35 billion to $40 billion range in accretive yield.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
And dealers are feeling really, really good right now. Obviously, pretty big margins they're making on cars just
from the lack of available inventory. So, a really good time for them.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. Jenn, I think you just referenced in your tail end of your response there that origination range of $35 billion
to $40 billion. Is that kind of how you're thinking about the full year originations at this point in auto? I mean, how
14


Ally Financial, Inc.
(ALLY) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
close to the $40 billion could we be? And could we be even be above that just given the demand and given the
inventory dynamic that you [indiscernible] (00:44:27) out on the new side? Could we be looking at originations
potentially above that $40 billion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. John, we don't have any caps. So, it'll be opportunistic. I'd say, out of the gate here in 2021, really strong
flows, strong pricing. And here, headed into Q2, same trends continuing. So, we could be closer to that $40 billion
than the $35 billion. And if we get above that, it'll just be market dependent. But you saw here in the first quarter
we had our highest outflow in the history of the company. We have the highest number of dealers. And so, we
really like what we see coming in. And we'll just be opportunistic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, separately, on the ROE side, I heard you – in terms of the upside potential
potentially to the 15%, you specifically mentioned 2021 in terms of sizing up the size of the plus there. Could there
also be upside potential to your thoughts around 2022 and 2023? Or is the abating benefit of credit leverage likely
to limit that upside potential for those years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. John, 2022, 2023 in this environment seems pretty far out there. But we do have high confidence in that
15% number. And we have that confidence because we're not embedding any reserve releases. And we're
assuming that retail NCOs hit that kind of normalized 1.4% to 1.6% range. So, could there be upside to that?
Absolutely. I mean, we're sitting here in the first quarter with 53 basis points of regional auto NCOs. And so, we'll
see how that path continues in actuals and strong leading indicators there as well. So, we'll see. But the high
confidence is around the fact that we have not embedded really aggressive assumptions on anything, whether
that's revenue driven or NCO credit related.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And most of my questions actually have already been asked and answered. Maybe we could drill
down on a couple of the topics that you've talked a little bit about. I think the ability to achieve these plus over 7%
origination yields has been really impressive. And maybe you could kind of just talk a little bit more about some of
the specific strategies that you've used and related to the fact of competitive developments that were going on in
the industry – on your side of the industry right now the lending industry.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Moshe, good morning. Yeah. What I would say is, look, this is a strong market and we have strong
capabilities in the market. And if you look at the market, it's large. It's growing. No competitor has kind of over
10% market share. And so, there's still a lot of room for us to find opportunities. And then, relative to our
capabilities, a number of things I'd point out. One is the relationships we've had literally over decades. And you
see not only dealer count continuing to grow, but engagement across those dealers is growing as you think about
kind of [indiscernible] (00:47:51) dealer and we have we think significantly more opportunity there especially on
the engagement side.
And then, second, continuing to evolve our capabilities. And that takes a number of different forms of how we
deliver our products through digital means. We've continued to help our dealers transition digitally. We've
continued to lean into used, as I've talked about for several quarters. And so, just staying focused on our
customers, focused on delivering for them, adding new capabilities to be successful for our end consumers and
our dealers and just continuing to find that opportunity. And as you pointed out, that 7%, this will be our fourth
year in a row of putting deals on the books. So, it's kind of in that 7% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right. A follow-up is about the questions around – you addressed it in the last question and a couple of the others
about the sustainability of returns post this year. And I guess – and maybe are there steps that you're taking in a
year like this where obviously the level of earnings whether the ability to reduce the equity base, how important is
that in the ability to sustain better than 15% returns? And any other steps that you're taking during 2021 that you'd
share with us? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure, Moshe. I mean, it really starts with our businesses. So, we are continuing to invest in differentiated
capabilities. And that's across auto. It's across our deposit franchise. Those capabilities reduce price elasticity
across the board and allow us to continue due to our strong pricing position deliver that NIM expansion,
continuing to invest in our newer businesses, which are really starting to accrete return here in 2021 and growing
into 2022 and 2023. And so, you see volumes up in our direct-to-consumer mortgage space and a lot of
opportunity there. And we've talked about that $10 billion number. But with our leading digital capabilities, I think
there's a lot of market share opportunity. Ally Lending continues to grow. We're investing both in human capital,
as well as digital capabilities there. And then, corporate finance as well continues to accelerate.
And so, absolutely, we're taking measures across every one of our businesses to remain competitive, remain
differentiated. And then, as we think about capital deployment, well, we are in good shape to execute the $1.6
billion of share repurchases. We'll continue to find other opportunities organically or inorganically to deploy capital
accretively. And we see equity coming down but it's not – it's going to take some time to get there.

Operator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, and great quarter and good job. Question on the ROTCE again. And we get a lot of
questions on it. So, I figured, let me just get in on that. Jenn, I know you mentioned it's ex-reserve release. And
you talked about continued strength in the NIM. And you're not even being aggressive on revenue expectations.
So, maybe just taking the other side of that, where are the risks to not achieving those targets in the 2021-2022
period outside of the economy sort of changing gears?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Sanjay, you asked this question last quarter, too. So, let me reiterate not too much has changed since
then. But within kind of the four walls of Ally, there's not too much that can go off the rails. I mean – and we talked
about kind of the 10 years of continuing to build dominant businesses on both sides of the balance sheet. And
much of that NIM trajectory is largely baked. I mean, about 85% of our retail auto book is already at that 7% yield
so the migration up to the 7% was kind of fair and we're seeing opportunities to sustain that [ph] and then some
(00:52:14).
And then, on the deposit side, we've talked a lot about not just the continued growth there. And as we grow those
balances as well as digital capabilities, the beta on that business is going to continue to decline. And so, a lot of
what we're seeing in the NIM is baked. And then, our new businesses are continuing to accelerate. We're
operating in a digital world. And consumers are not only working from home, they're banking from home and
every single one of our new businesses hit records this quarter. And we don't see any of that slowing down in
2021 and beyond into 2022 and 2023.
So, to your question, the rest, I really think they're exogenous. I think it's continued regulatory changes, potential
changes in the economy, whether that's inflationary driven that could change consumer spend or have some kind
of additional kind of economic shock. And then, taxes, I mean, to be determined on the tax rate, I think we're well
positioned relative to tax changes. But I really think any kind of risks to the trajectory are going to come from
outside the four walls of Ally.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And the follow-up question is on the dealers. You obviously have increased the penetration on that dealer
to – and the dealer count is really high at this point. I mean, could you just talk about the runway for growth from
here, whether it's penetrating those existing – the new dealers that you're bringing on as well as just growing that
dealer count from here?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yes, Sanjay. I think it's kind of all of the above. We're going to continue to grow dealers [indiscernible] (00:53:58)
newer entrants as well as traditional dealers. I think we're not as concerned about dealer counts but more quality
of dealer relationships. So, I think we have shared in the past the vast majority of our dealers give us less than
kind of five contracts per month. And we're looking to continue to increase dealer engagement and contracts by
dealer.
And then, continuing to grow with those who are growing in the industry and some of that's traditional kind of M&A
led and some of that is just the growth of kind of the Carvanas and the new entrants. And so, we see a lot of
opportunity quite frankly across the board on all measures.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Just to follow up on the – some of your loan origination yields. Are you seeing any impact from
increasing competition in the most recent quarter, given the re-engagement of some banks in the auto sector [ph]
and expansion (00:55:07) of their credit box? And then, also, on a follow-up to that, are you seeing any additional
competitive forces from more new entrants looking to do direct lending as opposed to establishing dealer
relationships and so forth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Kevin, I'll jump in and JB may want to add. But in terms of just the competitive environment, we have
seen, kind of, some of the larger banks and regionals growing originations in this sector. And we would expect
that to happen because it's a thriving market. What I would say is it's mostly on the two ends of the barbell. It's
predominantly in super-prime. And if you look at pricing betas in the super-prime, they're much higher than they
are in the prime space in the belly of the curve. In fact, our price elasticity in that space over time has been really
resilient. So, we haven't really felt it in, kind of, the sweet spot of 620 to 720 FICO and then used. But I think it's
something that we'll be managing over time. And then, in the direct space, very small, kind of, impacts across the
board. And we are well positioned. We have a direct product. So, if the market does move towards more direct
sales, we're well prepared for that, but not seeing a lot of movement there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. In the press release, you mentioned Ally Lending is going to have a retail launch in 2Q. Maybe just share
a little bit about the launch there and expectations and what kind of product. I'm assuming its point-of-sale. But is
it softline that kind of retail-focused?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Good morning, Arren. So, Ally Lending has been expanding into new verticals. And so, we've
originally purchased Ally's health credit services and has been very successful in the health vertical. We've since
expanded into Home. And about 20% of our originations have grown over the last several quarters through that
Home launch.
And to your question specifically, we're working towards launching a product in the retail space through our
partnership with Sezzle. And so, we see a lot of growth opportunity. In fact, this kind of retail is the largest point-
of-sale market that we want to have a product. We have a great offering. And we see growth opportunities. And
that's really what the press release is alluding to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And I think we've probably talked about this in the past but the – does it make sense to grow this organically? Or
given the competitive environment for point-of-sale lending, does it make sense to maybe buy something a little
bit bigger and have a little bit more of a head start?

then, look at the trajectory of originations just even from when we acquired Ally Lending. And we're well on our
way to a couple billion. So, we have a robust platform. We can originate across kind of all verticals. And as we
add partners – partnerships onto the platform and merchant accounts, we can scale this very quickly organically. I
