Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal
presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce Webster's Director of Investor Relations, Terry Mangan, to introduce the call. Please
go ahead, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrence K. Mangan
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Webster Financial Corp.
Thank you, Daryl. Welcome to Webster. This conference is being recorded. Also, this presentation includes
forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, with respect to Webster's financial condition, results of operations and business and financial performance.
Webster has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and projections about future
events. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual
results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in Webster Financial's public
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 8-K containing our earnings release for
the fourth quarter of 2020.
I'll now introduce Webster's Chairman and CEO, John Ciulla.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Webster's fourth quarter earnings call. CFO, Glenn
MacInnes and I will review business, financial and credit performance for the quarter, after which HSA Bank
President, Chad Wilkins; and Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer, will join us for Q&A.
As we look back on 2020, a challenging year for all of us in so many different ways, my first thought is how proud
I am of Webster bankers, as they found a way to deliver for each other, our customers, our communities, and for
our shareholders. While increasing COVID cases continue to present real challenges, we are optimistic that 2021
will bring a level of normalization as the distribution of vaccines dramatically changes the path of the pandemic;
the broader economy, including COVID-impacted sectors continue to recover; and the peaceful transition of
power that occurred yesterday, hopefully, represents the beginning of a less-divisive political environment. We
remain focused on prudently managing capital, credit and liquidity, as we also position ourselves for growth and
outperformance as the macro environment improves in 2021 and beyond.
Turning to slide 2. I'm really pleased with our strong business performance in the quarter. We originated $1.9
billion in loans, generated strong loan-related fees, continued to grow deposits, and HSA total footings
approached $10 billion. Credit trends are favorable and the net interest margin has stabilized. Our adjusted
earnings per share in Q4 were $0.99, up from $0.96 a year ago. Our fourth quarter performance includes $42
million of pre-tax charges related to the strategic initiatives we announced last quarter. Glenn will provide
additional perspective on these charges in his remarks.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
An improved economic outlook with continued uncertainty, along with a flat quarter-over-quarter loan portfolio,
supported a $1 million CECL allowance release in the quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted return on common
equity was 11.5%. And the adjusted return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 14.2%.
On slide 3, loans grew 8% from a year ago or 2%, when excluding $1.3 billion in PPP loans. Commercial loans
grew 6% from a year ago or more than $800 million. Deposits grew 17% year-over-year, driven across all
business lines. Loan yield increased 4 basis points linked-quarter, while deposit costs continue to decline.
Slides 4 through 6 set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business. I'm on slide 4. This is a very
strong quarter for Commercial Banking with more than $1.2 billion of loan originations, up solidly from Q3 and
down only slightly from a strong 4Q 2019. Loan fundings of $825 million were also up solidly from Q3. We
continue to benefit from our industry expertise and deep relationships in select sectors, including technology that
have not been adversely impacted during the pandemic.
Commercial bank deposits are at record levels, up more than 35% from the prior year's fourth quarter. The
Commercial Banking loan portfolio yield increased 9 basis points in the quarter, driven by better spreads and
enhanced by a higher level of acceleration of deferred fees as we saw payoff activity return to more normalized
levels. Noninterest income in Commercial Banking was up linked-quarter due to higher syndication and other fees
tied to the strong origination activity.
Now, turning to HSA Bank on slide 5. HSA Bank total footings increased 17% from a year ago and now total
nearly $10 billion. Core deposits were up 15% and 13%, excluding the State Farm acquisition, which closed in
2020. The year-over-year increase in balances was driven by continued contributions, as well as reduced
accountholder spending due to COVID-19 restrictions. The TPA accounts declined from a year ago, reflecting the
expected departures that occurred in Q3.
We added 668,000 accounts in 2020, 10% fewer than we added in 2019, consistent with industry trends and due
primarily to lower enrollments with existing employers, as COVID-19 impacted the overall employment
environment. We expect this trend to continue into the first half of the new year. HSA deposit costs continue to
decline as we remain disciplined in this low-interest rate environment and totaled 9 basis points in the quarter.
I'm now on slide 6. Community Banking loans grew 5% year-over-year and declined 5%, excluding PPP. As
indicated on the slide, PPP loans decreased $63 million, as we saw repayment and forgiveness activity again in
the quarter. Community Banking deposits grew 14% year-over-year, with consumer and business deposits
growing 9% and 31%, respectively. Deposit costs continued to decline and totaled 16 basis points in the quarter.
Net interest income grew $8.3 million from a year ago, driven by overall loan and deposit growth.
The next two slides address credit metrics and trends, which continue to be surprisingly stable, given all the
challenges in the macro environment. On slide 7 we show our commercial loan sectors most directly impacted by
COVID. Overall loan outstandings to these sectors have declined 10% from September 30, and payment
deferrals have declined $64 million or 31%.
On slide 8, we provide more detail across our $20 billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio. The key
takeaway here is that payment deferrals declined by 35% to $315 million at December 31, and now represent
1.6% of total loans compared to 2.4% of total loans at September 30. At year-end, $100 million or 32% of the
$315 million in payment deferrals are first-time deferrals. And CARES Act and interagency-statement-defined

payment deferrals, which are included in the $315 million of total payment deferrals at December 31 decreased
29% from September 30 and now stand at $201 million.
While challenges related to the pandemic and the overall economy remain, I am pleased with the considerable
support we have been able to provide to our customers as they work through these challenging times. We
continue to actively monitor risk, make real-time credit rating decisions and address potential credit issues
proactively. We remain confident about the quality of our risk selection and our underwriting processes, our
portfolio management capabilities and our capital position.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.

Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. I will focus on the key aspects of performance in the quarter, including stable adjusted net interest
margin, an increase in noninterest income, ongoing expense control and a favorable credit profile.
I'll begin with our average balance sheet on slide 9. Average securities grew $160 million or 1.8% linked-quarter.
Securities represented 27% of total assets at December 31. Average loans declined $142 million or 0.6% linked-
quarter, primarily driven by $176 million decline in consumer loans, reflecting higher paydown rates in mortgage
and home equity portfolios. Prepayment and forgiveness on PPP loans during the quarter totaled $98 million. In
Q4, we recognized $7.3 million of PPP deferred fee accretion. And the remaining deferred fee balance totaled
$27 million at December 31.
Deposits increased $276 million linked-quarter, primarily driven by growth in Community Banking and HSA. This
was partially offset by a reduction in CDs. The strong growth in deposits allowed us to pay down borrowings,
which were lower by $289 million from Q3. At $1.9 billion, borrowings represent 5.2% of total assets compared to
7% at September 30 and 11.6% in prior year. The tangible common equity ratio increased to 7.9% and will be 32
basis points higher, excluding the $1.3 billion 0% risk-weighted PPP loans. Tangible book value per share at
quarter end was $28.04, an increase of about 1% from September 30 and 3% from prior year.
Slide 10 highlights adjustments to reported net income. Aggregate adjustments totaled $42 million pre-tax or
$31.2 million after-tax, representing $0.35 per share. Of the $42 million in adjustments, $38 million is related to
our strategic initiatives, which John will discuss further. The remaining $4.1 million is associated with the debt
prepayment. The prepayment expense adversely impacted current quarter net interest income and impacted net
interest margin by 5 basis points. However, we will benefit by approximately $1.3 million in net interest income per
quarter; and NIM will benefit by 2 basis points.
On slide 11, we provide our reported and adjusted income statement. As highlighted on the previous page, the
adjustments total $42 million pre-tax. On an adjusted basis, net interest income increased by $1.3 million from
prior quarter. This was a result of a $4.5 million reduction in deposit and borrowing costs, along with $1 million in
additional loan income, which was partially offset by a $4 million decline in securities income, primarily as a result
of elevated prepayments. Taken together, our adjusted net interest margin of 2.8% was flat to third quarter.
As compared to prior year, net interest income declined by $11 million. $47 million of the decline was the net
result of lower market rates and was partially offset by interest income of $29 million from earning asset growth
and $8 million from a reduction in borrowings.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Noninterest income increased $1.7 million linked-quarter and $5.9 million from prior year. Loan fees increased
$2.5 million from prior quarter as a result of higher syndication, prepayment and line usage fees. Other income
increased $4.4 million, reflecting higher direct investment income and swap fees.
HSA fee income decreased $3.1 million linked-quarter, as Q3 included $3.2 million of exit fees on TPA accounts.
Mortgage banking revenues decreased $3 million linked-quarter as a result of lower volume on loans originated
for sale. The $5.9 million increase in noninterest income from prior year reflects additional loan fees, higher
mortgage banking revenue and HSA fee income, partially offset by lower deposit service fees.
Noninterest expense of $181 million reflects an increase of $2 million, primarily due to technology and seasonal
increases in temporary staffing to support the HSA annual enrollment. Noninterest expense decreased $1.5
million or 1% from prior year. And our efficiency ratio was 60% in the quarter.
Pre-provision net revenue was $116 million in Q4. This compares to $115 million in Q3 and $122 million in prior
year. Our CECL provision in the quarter reflects a credit of $1 million, which I'll discuss in more detail on the next
slide. And our adjusted tax rate was 22.1%.
Turning to slide 12, I'll review the results of our fourth quarter allowance for loan losses under CECL. The
allowance coverage ratio, excluding PPP loans, declined from 1.8% to 1.76%, with total reserves of $359 million.
The reserve balance reflects our lifetime estimate of credit losses.
The small decline from prior quarter is the net effect of an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast, partially
offset by additional qualitative reserves. The increase in qualitative reserves is driven by uncertainty around the
resolution of the pandemic and the pace of the recovery. The total reserves provide a more adverse scenario than
shown in the baseline assumptions at the bottom of the page.
Slide 13 highlights our key asset quality metrics as of December 31. Nonperforming loans, in the upper left,
increased $3 million from Q3. Commercial, residential mortgage and consumer each saw linked-quarter declines,
while commercial real estate increased.
Net charge-offs, in the upper right, decreased from the third quarter and totaled $9.4 million after $1.9 million in
recoveries. The net charge-off rate was 17 basis points in the quarter. Commercial classified loans, in the lower
left, increased $30 million from Q3 and represented 352 basis points of total commercial loans.
Slide 14 highlights our liquidity metrics. Our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with
considerable flexibility. Deposit growth of $414 million exceeded total asset growth and lowered the loan-to-
deposit ratio to 79%. Our sources of secured borrowing capacity increased further and totaled $12 billion at
December 31.
Slide 15 highlights our strong capital metrics. Regulatory capital ratios exceed well-capitalized levels by
substantial amounts. Our common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.35% exceeds well-capitalized by $1.1 billion. Likewise,
tier 1 risk-based capital of 11.99% exceeds well-capitalized levels by $895 million.
Our guidance will continue to be impacted by the pace and duration of the pandemic over the next few quarters.
That being said, we anticipate modest loan growth, excluding the timing of PPP forgiveness and round two
originations.

NIM will also be influenced by the rate environment and PPP forgiveness. Assuming today's rates, we would
expect net interest income to be around Q4's level. Noninterest income will be modestly lower linked-quarter,
driven by lower loan-related and mortgage banking fees.
The provision for credit losses will continue to be impacted by credit trends, the macroeconomic environment,
government stimulus and the duration of the pandemic. Core operating expenses will be lower as we begin to
recognize the benefits of our strategic initiatives. And our tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22%.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for a review of our strategic initiatives.

John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. I'm on slide 16. As we discussed on the October earnings call, we've been working through a
comprehensive, strategic and organizational review since before the onset of the pandemic. And while today we'll
provide more detail on our progress and some shorter-term financial targets, I want to stress that the work we've
done over the last year and the actions we are taking are transforming our company and the way we do business.
We believe that we will continue delivering incremental value to our customers and shareholders for years to
come, consistent with our overarching objectives of maximizing economic profits and creating long-term franchise
value.
Importantly, these actions afford us the capacity to invest in the future and provide better customer experiences
through improved products, services and digital offerings, all in the furtherance of our mission to help individuals,
families and businesses achieve their financial goals.
We're investing in revenue growth drivers that leverage our differentiated businesses. These include accelerating
growth in new and existing Commercial Banking segments, improving sales productivity, enhancing noninterest
income through treasury and commercial card products and driving deeper relationships across all lines of
business.
While we anticipate short-term benefits from these initiatives, they will contribute meaningfully to our financial
performance in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, we continue to invest in technology to provide better digital
experiences for our customers and bankers to further improve customer acquisition and retention rates.
As shown on slide 17, we have made significant progress on our efficiency opportunities. We remain on track to
deliver an 8% to 10% reduction in core noninterest expense. We expect this to be fully realized on a run rate
basis by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our efficiency initiatives fall into three areas of focus that we
discussed last quarter: Rationalizing retail and commercial estate; simplifying the structure of the organization;
and optimizing our ancillary spend. We've taken actions to simplify our organizational structure, including
combining like functions, automating manual processes and selectively outsourcing commoditized activities. A
portion of the project-related expense adjustments that Glenn discussed relate to these actions and the
associated severance costs result from a targeted reduction in the overall workforce.
We announced in December, the consolidation of 27 banking centers, and we have targeted actions aimed at
reducing corporate office square footage over time. The real estate optimization plan reflects our response to
changes in customer preferences and the shift in workplace dynamics that have only accelerated during the
pandemic. The remaining quarterly cost/benefits will be driven by a more disciplined approach to ancillary spend,
redesigning and automating internal critical processes and leveraging back-office synergies.

Slide 18 provides an overview of the cost savings and an expense walk to our fourth quarter target run rate.
Achieving these efficiencies will allow us to continue to invest in our franchise and improve the customer
experience.
The last slide for me is an important one. We've updated it from prior quarters. It aggregates our activities during
2020 related to helping our employees, our consumer and business customers and the communities we serve,
navigate an extraordinarily challenging time. This is what The Webster Way is all about. I have to thank each of
our bankers for their dedication, perseverance and hard work during the pandemic and through a period of
transformation. The commitment to our customers, our shareholders and to each other has enabled Webster to
continue to differentiate itself.
And before we go to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to share with you all that today is Terry Mangan's last
earnings call, as he will be retiring on March 31. Many of us and many of you have had the pleasure of working
with Terry over his 18-year career at Webster. Terry's efforts have been recognized at the national level by
Institutional Investor as a top investor relations professional. I want to thank Terry personally for a significant and
long-lasting contributions that have helped our organization navigate through exciting, fun and challenging times.
With that, Daryl, Glenn, Chad, Jason and I are prepared to take questions.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the strategic plan. And appreciate the $18 million of projected cost saves being called out by
4Q. John, can you give us an idea – or maybe Glenn, in terms of the timing of that recognition through the year?
I'm just trying to get a better sense of when these cost saves will work into the run rate through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. Steve, I'll take a shot, and then Glenn can add some more context. As he said, first quarter expenses should
show the beginning of our expense moves. The second quarter, when the banking center consolidations are
complete and many of the employee actions will be complete, will be the real time where we'll see a more
dramatic shift in expenses, and then we see more savings in the third and fourth quarter. So, without giving you

kind of a specific scorecard, I'd say, first quarter will be modest. You'll see a bigger drop in the second and third
quarters, getting to that final run rate target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe for Glenn, I appreciate the NII guidance for the first quarter. But if we think
about the forward curve, how are you thinking about the trajectory of margin through the year? And specifically,
I'm hoping you comment on the additional opportunity maybe to pay down additional borrowings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, thanks, Steve, and good morning. So, I think I would look at two things: One is that, as I highlighted in
my prepared remarks, we did see a sort of increase in prepayment speeds, particularly on the CMBS portfolio.
And you see that reflected when you look at the yield on the treasury portfolio. So, that's something that's
changed, and I think that's industry wide. So, a little bit of pressure on NIM there – on core NIM there.
As far as borrowings, we do have the opportunity based on year-end, to pay down probably another – up to $500
million in borrowings. Now, those are all short-term, low-rate borrowings. I think the weighted cost is somewhere
around 8 basis points. So, that's sort of what I would say is point A.
Point B would be on the funding side, we still have about $900 million in CDs coming due in the first quarter. And
that's at 80, 81 basis points. And those will typically reprice down to the 20s, let's say, 25 to 27 basis points. For
the full year, we have about $2 billion in CDs that are coming due at 66 basis points, so it's probably 30 basis
points to be had on that as well. So, if I look at core NIM, I'm looking at core NIM in the range of 2.8% – bouncing
around from like 2.85% to 2.87%, give or take.
Now, the wild card's of course going to be liquidity and the stimulus, as more money flows into the market.
Depending on the final bill, we could be left with a lot – municipalities and businesses with a lot more liquidity. And
to the extent we don't see the loan growth, you'd have to park that money at the Fed or invest some of it. So,
we're constantly looking at those alternatives.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Then, maybe one final one, assuming Chad's there. So, HSA account growth was a bit soft
in 2020. Can you talk about the outlook for 2021 and maybe any early reads given the enrollment season that
wrapped? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Chad, I'll throw that directly over to you, if that's okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President, Head-HSA Bank & Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's great. Thanks, John. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, Steve, if you've been tracking our account growth over
the last three quarters, we've been down about 15% to 20% over prior periods due to the impact of the pandemic
on the economy and the labor markets. We're seeing similar trends in our 1/1 enrollments as core new accounts
for January and trending to Q1 are about 20% behind last year at this point.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Most of the – or all the weakness actually really is in our new accounts from existing employers, which we've
stated before represents about 80% of our account generation. And so, as of the latest information, new accounts
– HSA accounts from existing employers are down about 30%. But as we've talked in prior calls, we're having a
very good new employer sales season, so we're up about 25% in our enrollments with new employers coming on
board. So, in aggregate, we're down about 20%, which again, is in line with the reductions we've seen since the
pandemic. Started in Q2, and it seems to be consistent across the industry.

your questions.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Good morning, gentlemen; and congratulations to Terry on your retirement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Chris. It's good to hear from you. Strange to see a different name than Collyn's since before the financial
crisis. Quite a long streak, but we're glad to have you on the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell, Jr. Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Absolutely. So, just circling back maybe to Chad, following up on the last question. Was that just referring on
those percentages to account growth? And if so, do you have a read-through as to what the deposit balances
might be doing with enrollment season in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll just say – hi. We mentioned, the deposits really haven't tracked along with accounts because of,
obviously, additional seasoning of the accounts, but also because during 2020, the pandemic really slowed a lot
of the spend out of the accounts. So, they're a little – I won't say, artificially higher, but in essence, they are
because there hasn't been too much spend.
But, Chad, maybe you can put a finer point on what 1/1 looks like or what the year looked like with respect to
deposits?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Okay. Chad just dropped from the call. So, Chris, what I would say is, we said deposits were up about 13% and
15%, respectively. If you take out the State Farm acquisition, it's 13%, it's 15%. And so, while accounts were
generally flat, if you add back the TPA accounts – and our new account growth was as Chad said about 20%
behind the prior year – we still had significant growth in deposits. And we're seeing pretty significant growth in
deposits in the first quarter, too, more similar to last year. Glenn can give you the dollar amount. But there is that
interesting dynamic that the reason that accounts and deposits are kind of separating a bit is because there's not
as much money swipes to the individual accounts because people aren't getting as many elective medical
services as they had before the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
And I would just add, I mean, our forecast – and it's still relatively early. Our forecast for deposits quarter-over-
quarter, so fourth quarter, at the end of the first quarter, somewhere between $350 million to $400 million at this
point.

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
I think we have Chad back. I don't know, Chad, if you heard us. Anything you wanted – else you wanted to say
about kind of deposits? I talked about them kind of splitting off from account growth because of certain pandemic
related trends.
Okay. He's not on. We'll move on. Chris, does that answer your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell, Jr. Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Yeah. No, that's fine. That's great. The $350 million to $400 million, I think, is a good starting point. And then, you
guys have mentioned I think kind of modest loan growth outlook, at least near term. As you kind of go through the
course of 2021, and obviously, the environment is kind of constantly changing at this point, but where are you
guys seeing loan growth demand and where are you most comfortable growing loans at to this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, I think that's a great question. And I always give this answer that every quarter, we seem to have
significant rises in payoffs, or lower payoffs, or big spikes in originations. And lo and behold, even in a pandemic
year, you look at commercial loan growth and it's approaching that 8% to 10% that we kind of are able to produce
year in and year out. And I always talk to you guys about all the different levers we have, both geographically and
in different sectors and across asset classes.
Fourth quarter was interesting. We didn't see overall balance sheet loan growth at the bank, but we saw actually
outflow of mortgage refi, even though our activity was pretty high. And while we had really high originations for
what we thought was going to be a pandemic-muted fourth quarter, we also had significant payoffs.
And so, while fourth quarter 2019 was driven really by great commercial real estate growth, fourth quarter 2020
was driven by great sponsor and specialty growth, particularly in the technology and healthcare sectors.
So as we look forward, I think there may be still a little bit of uncertainty in the real estate market. Obviously, some
property types – retail, we don't do a lot of – there's not opportunity right now, and lot of uncertainty in hotel. And

so, you think about mixed use, industrial office. And I think a lot of our key really great real estate investors are
kind of taking a pause. So I would say the pipelines there are okay, but not great. I still think technology and
healthcare will drive a good amount of growth. Our middle market and municipality and institutional business has
really been solid during this time in this rate environment, and we think that'll continue.
So I would say, look to C&I more than commercial real estate, would be my guess. And then, as it relates – I think
one of the reasons Glenn talks about modest is because while we do see some pipeline, we also see some
forecasted payoff activity. And so, that'll be the wildcard on whether we can actually significantly grow the loan
book.

Good morning. Just going back to the earlier question on the HSA business. It seems like, just stepping back a
bit, much of the slower growth is COVID-related in one way or another. What's your sense of, for example, if we
were to get vaccine efficacy midyear, when does the HSA business kind of shake off this hangover?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Yeah. I'll take a shot and I'll give it to Chad. I think, again, let me put a high perspective on it. We are still so
bullish on the business. Our trends are consistent with what we can read at least through to the periodic
[indiscernible] (00:32:35) report and what our pure play competitors report in conferences. It does seem to be an
industry sector experience that we're seeing.
I think I want to put a finer point on what Chad said before that really the slowdown in account growth was almost
entirely related to existing customers we have, not signing up as many new accounts and new employers
because of the employment market, right? Many companies aren't hiring. Some companies are shedding
employees.
And so, I do think that the good news for us is that during the pandemic, we actually had our best year in terms of
driving new large employer wins. And so, while accounts per employer are down, we're adding customers. And
so, as the economy rebounds, as the employment market changes, as confidence gets out there and there's more
activity, we feel like we'll naturally be able to capture new accounts through the new employers we've gotten.
I think my best guess would be like everything else, but we look to the second half of 2021 when there is a little bit
more activity. And then, as we recall, there may be some pent-up demand for medical procedures which could
also mute deposit growth over time. But we think that's when we might get more activity in the market.
Chad, I don't know if you disagree or if you have anything further to provide there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President, Head-HSA Bank & Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
That's exactly right, John. We think that everything will come back to pre-pandemic levels as the economy opens
up and we get beyond the pandemic. And you hit all the key points. And just to hit what was [audio gap]
(00:34:22) I'm not sure exactly how you answered that, John. But to add to that, yeah, we're seeing similar
deposit growth that we saw last year in the first quarter. So we expect first quarter to be about the same. But one
of the things we need to keep in mind is the TPA accounts. We expect about 60% of the deposits and accounts to
roll off as we go through the rest of the year; not so much in the first quarter, but the rest of the year.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
For you, John, is on the expense initiatives. I'm curious if you think there's even more room to kind of push cost
and efficiency ratios lower, given the increased digitization of the business. Once you complete this optimization
program, do you think you can drive efficiency even lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
We do, Mark. And we thought about how to present this. You'll see on page 18, it really represents the low end of
the 8% to 10% range. We do think that we'll be able to achieve the full 10% in that range; and as we move into
2022, continue to become more efficient and lower the unit cost of delivery.
One of the things I want to be clear about is that we're not about generating shareholder value through cost-
cutting. What we want to do is make sure that we can continue to drive our differentiated Commercial Banking
business, and our HSA business and our Community Bank business and grow over time. So, hopefully, we
continue to be more and more efficient on a unit cost basis, Mark, over time.

Our goal, obviously, is if we do get a lift in rates and loan growth comes back significantly, we want to be prepared
to be able to expand Commercial Banking, hire new commercial bankers, continue to invest in technology. So our
real dollar level of cost may go up. But ultimately, we want to achieve operating leverage, deliver this really
significant step in lowering our cost structure, and then over time, continue to drive efficiencies both on the cost
line and by generating operating leverage and higher revenues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then, secondly, can you update us on how you're thinking about geographic expansion? And maybe
share some thoughts on whether your view with respect to M&A has changed? Obviously, you have a strong
currency now. I'm curious how you're thinking about M&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting, I think from a geographic expansion perspective, it's always on our drawing board. And we
have paused obviously in this unique environment over the last few years in kind of a credit frenzy. First, a lot of
competition, and now, obviously the pandemic. I could see us expanding in contiguous geographic metro markets
to go into middle market.
As you know, we have a significant national presence in our key industry sector specialties, which I think we've
proven over time. We know how to select risk and we have really deep knowledge there. So, we've been able to
maintain good growth and expansion without planting flags in others cities. But we do see that as part of the tool
of expanding Commercial Banking over time.
With respect to M&A, it's interesting, I got a lot of feedback from the last call that I had pivoted, and I certainly
didn't mean to. I mean I think the answer for us is always, as you know, we're very confident in the fact that we
believe we've got differentiated businesses that we need to exploit over time, and we need to continue to invest
in. And so, we think we can grow organically over time.
We've also said that scale matters and that if there were a really, really compelling opportunity in HSA or from a
whole bank perspective, that had great strategic and financial merit to it, obviously, we would look at it. But I will
tell you that this bank right now, particularly, Mark, as you can imagine undergoing the transformation we're going
through right now is completely focused internally at making sure that we drive value, that we take care of our
customers and take care of our own business. And then, we'll look at opportunities if they arise.

Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Timur. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Maybe starting first on the allowance. Just wondering how heavy did you guys lean on the
qualitative overlays in keeping the allowance at somewhat of an artificially elevated level? And as we go forward,
how should we think about applying these qualitative overlays, and what type of pace of reserve release could we
see if the economic backdrop and credit picture remains unchanged?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So, hey, Timur. Good morning. It's Glenn. Let me take that and then John could add some color. But I'd first start
by saying, the quantitative method still represent a significant majority of our total allowance. So, that's the first
thing to keep in context. And I think with respect to qualitative adjustments, I think, in this environment,
heightened level of uncertainty, you probably would expect to see a higher percentage of qualitative versus
quantitative to account for the unknown.
And so, I think, the other thing to keep in perspective is through the 10 months of the pandemic, our customer
performance has been very different than prior recessions. And the qualitative factors help address the risk
outside the model. And so, that – we don't specifically disclose the qualitative reserve. But as you probably saw
on our K, it's driven by such factors, like credit concentration, credit quality trends, the quality of internal loan
reviews, nature and volume of the portfolio, staffing letters, underwriting recessions and economic considerations
that are not reflected in the base. So, that's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
I think that's great. I mean, that's – you obviously – Timur, you should be in any one of these banks and seen the
processes that we've all built to try and leverage lots of data and models. And so, it's primarily quantitatively
driven.
The reality, if I can step back, just from an industry perspective, right, is for all of us with a mid-30s exogenous
shock in GDP in the second quarter. All the models over-predicted, the quantitative models over-predicted losses
because you're plugging in a Moody's model, you're plugging in GDP, you're plugging in unemployment. And
obviously, we hadn't seen that in prior history that it predicted short-term significant losses that just weren't going
to come.
And now, what you're seeing on the other side is a little bit of the opposite, right, where you've got forward-looking
improved economic outlook. Not a lot of loan growth, so most banks have a pretty consistent portfolio. They're not
having to provide very much for new loans. And the models probably predict too much of a relief, given the
significant uncertainty around things like new strains of the virus, the distribution and efficacy of the vaccines,

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
what's – are we going to get the kind of government stimulus that's targeting the right areas? And so, there's still a
decent amount of uncertainty in there.
But Glenn's right, the process remains. The key for all the banks is to just have the right repeatable, modeled,
quantitative-driven process, and then be able to use some level of quantitative factors to make sure that what you
see and what is really happening doesn't over-predict or under-predict future losses.
And I've been surprised, quite frankly, just editorially looking at all of our peers and others. And what you're
seeing in the midcap space kind of there's a general theme of really small provisions to small releases
somewhere in that margin. So, we seem to be consistent with a lot of the peers as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. And could that accelerate if the loan growth doesn't reengage in, let's say, the next two quarters? Can we
see an acceleration of reserve releases as some of that uncertainty rolls off, or are you going to try and maintain
some of those balances and incorporate future loan growth into that amount?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So, loan growth is one variable. And so, I think – so, that's one thing we look at in addition to the economic
conditions, the credit quality, risk migration. And then, you got the other factors like government stimulus and
things like that potentially been down the road, so it's hard to say. But look, I think the $359 million total allowance
that we ended the year is our best estimate. It is the sum of primarily quantitative methods and then
supplemented with qualitative methods to account for uncertainty.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And then, last one for me, just on the second round of PPP, any kind of
guidance you guys can provide for us on what kind of magnitude we should be expecting out of the second round,
or is it still too early to tell?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
It's probably a little too early to call. But Jason, I don't know if you want to provide a little perspective on that. I got
some more stats this morning. I mean, we're active, and there's a good number of applications we have. Jason,
do you have some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, yeah. So, the first couple of days here, we received over 2,000 applications, about $250 million in total
volume. We've processed a good portion of those and ready to start submitting to the SBA. So, I think, overall, I
would say, we probably don't expect the same level of activity as we had last time around, but the early start has
been pretty good.

Hey, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
I just want to say, Terry, it's been a great, great pleasure working with you over the years.
Glenn, first question for you on the deferrals, and I love the detail you give. Can you just help us understand a
little bit, maybe more broadly, and any color you can give around the hotel book? It seems like we've only seen
sort of two categories, where we've seen the upticks understandably. But just if you can help us with any details
on that $123 million book, what the LTV is, where they're located, what's flagged? Any color you can share with
us around that, and just maybe the uptick going from $28 million to $45 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Jason, I'll throw that right to you if that's okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, yeah. No, that's fine. So, looking at the book, right, if you step back, it's really six or seven deals that make
up that population. And there's really only two deals that are in active deferral in that population. And both of those
are paying interest, right. They're not paying principal. We've given that deferral. And the recovery, we expect it to
be slow.
But we've seen some support and willingness by the sponsors or the owners to put some money into those just to
keep it going. And time will tell, right. And so, it's not a huge exposure. We're not overly concerned about it, but
we are obviously monitoring it closely. And going in – just to answer your question, the LTV going into the cycle,
and obviously, we'd all acknowledge there's been some impact here, but going into is about 60%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC

leverage. Again, that was the only other uptick that we saw in...

Jason Soto A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...deferrals. And that's still very, very, very small, obviously, 4.3% of roll rate. But any color you can give around
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take that one, sure. It was really driven by one credit that migrated in – that produced an active deferral, I
would say, offset by a couple others that came off. And that one credit, we're really not overly concerned about.
We sit in a capital structure on a first-out basis with less than 20% loan to value. It's in the leisure space, just so
you know. And there's five times the amount of junior equity in debt behind us in that deal. And in exchange for us
providing a deferral, the sponsor actually put in some equity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great, super helpful. Okay. And then, just wondered if maybe more broadly, John, just going back to where
Mark was going in terms of the M&A question, because again, to this point, your stock is – exponentially
outperformed here, certainly even recently. And so, that's very, very strong currency.
Can you help us think more generally if you were to consider full bank M&A, what's the smallest deal that makes
sense, what's the largest deal that makes sense, what's your sweet spot, just how you're approaching that? And I
realized you've got a lot going on here in the next couple of quarters, but just sort of thinking a little bit further out.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, Laurie, it's hard for me to provide a detailed perspective there. I think it's consistent with what I've
said before. And what we've said is that it's a pretty high bar for us from a financial perspective because we think
we've got a lot of organic running room, and we certainly don't want to kind of dilute that as we move forward.

I would say, if a transaction was really financially compelling, obviously, that would be one of the gating elements.
But more importantly for us, it's around strategy. And you've the makeup of our earning streams shift more
commercial over time, and more wholesale over time. And you've seen us try and aggressively grow HSA Bank.
So, kind of tuck-in acquisitions that are basically branch-based are not particularly interesting to us.
So, if something came along that enabled us to gain scale, was financially compelling and was consistent with our
strategic view of expanding our commercial banking capabilities and enhancing the value of our HSA franchise,
that would be something we would look at. So, I would say, larger rather than smaller and not really focused on
continuous branch acquisition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. Thanks. Okay. And then, just, Chad, one last question for you on HSA. Just looking at the – just in terms of
both your noninterest income, just the sharp drop linked-quarter, and then, also just more broadly looking at your
HSA efficiency ratio going from 52% to 54%. Can you help us think about that a little bit, especially since your NII
distribution...

million in GPA exit fees last quarter. So that's primarily what you're seeing on the drop on noninterest income.
And, obviously, that impacts efficiency ratio as well.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I apologize I jumped on a little late, so I'm not sure if you guys covered this. But on your margin, just looking at
your sensitivity, if the yield curve steepens, say, that the 10-year gets to 2% by the end of the year, how does that
look for your NII going to 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Look, I think if you look at our book, half of it is tied to the short end of the curve. So I think we have about $8.6
billion in one month LIBOR, another $3.5 billion at three-month LIBOR. So that's the primary driver. Obviously, our
resi book and our investment portfolio are tied to the longer end of the curve, but that will take a while to cycle
through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it, Glenn. And just the front end, you bought this through the floors. Is that correct?
[indiscernible] (00:52:08)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So we have about $3.5 billion of floors right now, and they're in the money about 50 to 55 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
That's primarily in commercial. There's little amount in home equity and smaller amount in business banking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And then just if the growth environment, if it's a little slow this year on loans, you guys are accumulating a
decent amount of capital. How are you guys thinking about buybacks and valuation levels that are attractive to
you guys and considering that?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think from a full capital management perspective, we've talked about, obviously, we feel like we'll maintain
the dividend as we go forward just in terms of growing our earnings back into the 40% to 50% payout ratio.
We had started, as you know, in the first quarter of 2020 to start buying back shares. And the pandemic hit. And
obviously, like most of our peers, decided it wasn't prudent until we had full clarity to continue that. We feel like
we're approaching that point sometime in the first quarter, early second quarter. And so, we do have approved
authority. And we expect to look more aggressively at stock repurchase, depending on where the stock price is
and what the market looks like beginning over the next several months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you. And then, just the last one from me. If the corporate tax rate gets to 20%, what would that do to
your effective tax rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So that is something that we've been talking about. And, obviously, tax strategy is something that we're
continually focused on. But I don't have a number for you on this call. But it is something that we're looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Appreciate it. Thanks, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

You're welcome.

William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks for taking my call, guys. I'm just curious, if you look at your commercial loan pipelines starting to build, are
you seeing any variations in demand geographically that that stands out to you?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's actually a great question, and we've been trying to look through all of that. I think in some ways, it's
really obvious. There are some geographic issues with respect to where areas have been opened and where they
haven't been. There's some difference – commercial, in particular, obviously consumers kind of rolling in the non-
metro suburban areas. Metro is a little bit more challenged.
But I think at the end of the day, more than geography, Bill, is sector. And so, we continue to see the biggest
disparity in loan demand across sectors, and that obviously seems pretty obvious. Those that have been
significantly impacted either don't have the credit worthiness or the ability to take on more capital. Those in the
middle who have been slightly impacted are being more conservative in terms of doing things forward that would
create the need for more loan capital.
And then, of course, as I mentioned earlier, we have some sectors that are growing quite nicely: technology,
technology infrastructure, healthcare. In some of those subsectors we play and we have expertise we're literally
seeing an unsurpassed demand. So, I would say, it's really sector-driven more than geographic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate that color. And then, a follow-up on the expense reduction target. That 8% to 10%
target from, I believe it was the third quarter operating run rate, are you anticipating – does that include
inflationary pressures, COLAs, et cetera, that we see in the beginning of every year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
It does. It's a net number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
It's a net number. So you'll see even in that walk, we said investments in businesses, it counts merit increases.
We expect to lower that on a real dollar basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. Okay, good. And then, also, as you look at the forgiveness of the PPP loans, what's your kind of
expectation of timing of that and ultimate level, based on what you know now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So we have about $1.3 billion at year-end, maybe just a little under that. And I would probably say about 40% in
the first quarter, 40% in the second quarter and then 10% and 10%, if you just think of it coming out that way. And
that can change. But that's how we're forecasting right now.

Please proceed with your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Good morning. I also joined a little bit late, so if my questions are redundant, please move on and I can follow up
offline. But first, Terry, thanks for your really highly professional stewardship of the investor relations functions
from the very early days of Webster as a public company. So we've enjoyed it...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrence K. Mangan A
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Webster Financial Corp.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
...and thank you for all your work. Two questions. The first is on capital. And I don't think this is a big deal, but
some of the big banks have been concerned that the overwhelming amount of stimulus money showing up in
bank balance sheets is pushing assets to a level where they may have capital problems.
I know you've managed the balance sheet down a little bit. But are there any issues that you can see that moving
forward, if you do get a lot more money, any deposit strategies, capital strategies that might affect your
management of the bank? And the second, well, I can – probably you should answer ask that question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
So, let me get that one. So, I think we have the opportunity to pay down, on a short-term basis, probably about
$0.5 billion more in short-term borrowings. But we are getting near the bottom of that. And I think what you're
highlighting is depending on stimulus and the eventual impact through municipalities and things like that, we could
be – I think the industry's – Bernie, seem to have a lot more excess capital.
Our loan to deposit ratio is 79% as of quarter end. It is something we're looking at as far as the deployment. If we
don't get the loan growth, do we buy floating rate securities, or do we park the money in the Fed. So, those are
conversations, Bernie, that we're having pretty much on a daily basis and just monitoring it.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Thanks. And the second question is just really about, we're all trying to guess which way the post-COVID world
goes. Certainly, you've been a beneficiary, I think, of the move to suburban and resi. But on the commercial side,
are you seeing any early warning signs that you might be cautious about with respect to the deployment of
commercial real estate office buildings and so forth, and whether you see any potential problems there just – I'm
sure you get the gist of the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's actually a great question, Bernie. And it's nice to hear from you. And I'll let Jason put a finer point on it. I
think we've got really good strong relationships in our investor CRE group, and I think everybody seems to be a
little bit more thoughtful and careful, particularly in metro market buildings. We're seeing even on – outside of
office, on our multifamily, we're not big in New York Metro, which obviously benefits us here. We are seeing, I
think, a little bit of stabilization in Boston. And given where we underwrite and the quality of the sponsors, we're
not seeing any cracks in multifamily.
I think in office, we've been sort of spending – I was getting like Bill Wrang mentioned on every earnings call. But
Bill, a while back, really pivoted. We had I think maybe 35% of our – 40% of our property types were in office,
going back 10 years ago. And I think Bill took a decided view at some of the paradigm shifts to move away from
that.
So, we don't have tons of metro office, which is good. And I think that like most people in the industry, our sense
now is we're not really going to know for several more quarters what would happen because you've got –
obviously, if you look at the real vacancy rates, meaning people in the seats in those buildings, in those offices in
Boston, and New York and Philadelphia where we have real estate exposure, you're talking 10% to 15%, 20% of
the people in their seats.
There's a lot of talk – and I've seen in Connecticut, a lot of the big companies and the CEOs I've talked to trying to
drive an immediate 25% reduction in their occupied office space coming out of the pandemic. But we also feel –
and you also read a lot about people starting to really struggle working remotely, and that – particularly, if you
have de-densified office space, you may have – you may need the same square footage going forward.
So, that's a long way from me of saying, I think, it's too soon. We are not seeing real problems yet. I think it is too
soon to see problems because you don't have lease renewals. And I think it's too soon to call what the future of
work will mean to office occupancy. But it's something that we're really focused on. And we are taking – your last
question was, I think we're taking that into consideration as we look at new potential opportunities, which would
mean we're going to be much more selective.
Jason, I probably stole all of your thunder. Is there anything...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No, it's okay. I'll ask three quick sort of data points, if you will, to support everything you said, which I think was
spot on. So, we've got one active deferral in our office portfolio, which is fairly large. It's spiked $4 million. So, the
portfolio has been performing very well. We've not received a lot of deferrals.
And to your point about sort of maturity of leases, we've got less than 10% of the square footage in our lease
portfolio, our office portfolio coming due over the next couple of years. So, less than 10% in 2021; less than 10%
in 2022, so I don't think there's a lot of near-term pressure.

And the last point I'll make is that going into this – and because we haven't seen...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Jason, I think we lost you. We're having technical problems today for the first time.

Jason Soto A

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & Member-Operating Management Committee, Webster Financial Corp.
Oh, you can, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
All right. So, the last point I would add is just, going into this and we still view this as reasonably good, until we get
more information, our loan to value on the entire portfolio is 54% and debt service coverage, over 2 times. So,
there's a fair amount of cushion even if you see pressure on rental rates or occupancy post-COVID.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A

Thanks, Jason.
