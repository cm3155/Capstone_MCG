Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Philip B. Flynn
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Diego, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Niles, our CFO;
and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer.
Before discussing our results for the fourth quarter and full year, I'd like to say a few words about the CEO
transition we also just announced. After 11 years with Associated, I announced my plans today to retire at the end
of 2021. I've been thinking about this for some time and in consultation with the board, we agreed this is the right
time to initiate our succession process.
As noted in the press release, I will continue as President and CEO until my successor is in place, at which time,
I'll step down from both of those roles and from the board. I'll be available to the new CEO in an advisory capacity
thereafter to assure a smooth transition for our colleagues. The board has commenced a search for a permanent
successor and we'll consider our internal as well as external candidates.
As you can appreciate, we cannot speculate on the timeline for that search. But the board and I are highly
confident that we'll name a strong successor who will take Associated to its next phase of success, continue our
profitable growth trajectory. I look forward to working with my successor to ensure a smooth and seamless
transition.
But now, let me turn to our fourth quarter and full year results. This was a year unlike any of us has experienced.
In the midst of incredible challenges and uncertainty, the commitment of our colleagues shown through. COVID-
19 changed every aspect of life, including how people and businesses bank. In navigating the unknown, it was
essential that our customers were able to connect – to count on us and that our teams were safe and well
positioned to provide their support. As businesses and schools shut down, we found new ways to support both
the health and financial well-being of our customers and communities. Through the efforts of our colleagues, we
were able to support our customers with over $1 billion of PPP loans, and adapt our branch services as our
customers shifted to remote banking.
It goes without saying that 2021 will have many challenges. However, the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines
promise a return to normality. Perhaps it's only fitting this year we will celebrate our 160 year as a company and
our rich history of supporting our customers and communities in their times of need. As we have through the
decades, we stand eager to help build a stronger economy and better society.
During 2020, we took several actions to prepare for the recovery we expect to see in 2021. On slide 2, you can
see the improving trends for a number of key items. With the sudden decline in interest rates this past year, we
quickly moved to reduce funding costs and implement strategies to stabilize and increase our asset yields.
Together, these actions helped drive margins higher during the fourth quarter.
In addition, beginning in the second quarter, we took several steps to increase the efficiency of our organization.
Included was the sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting; the third quarter efficiency initiatives; reducing
branches and personnel costs; and the recently announced sale of Whitnell, our family office subsidiary. Taken
together, these actions will help drive further improvement in our efficiency and expense run rate as we move into
2021.
We adopted CECL on January 1 and as the pandemic began to unfold, we moved swiftly to increase our
allowance in contemplation of the economy we saw through the middle of the year. As we move further through
the back half of the year, we were encouraged by the positive emerging trajectory of the economy. And as we

closed out the year, we're very pleased with the low levels of deferrals and new problem loans which allowed us
to bring down our provisioning over the back half of 2020.
Notably, we posted a net reserve release of $11 million during the fourth quarter. Collectively, these positive
trends drove the EPS improvement we saw in the fourth quarter. We recorded a $1.86 of GAAP earnings per
share for the full-year 2020 or a $1.19 when adjusted for the gain on sale of Associated Benefits and Risk
Consulting.
Turning to slide 3, let's drill further into some of these positive trends for the quarter. Our fourth quarter EPS was
$0.40, up more than 50% from the third quarter. We saw our net interest margin expand 18 basis points to 2.49%,
driven by expanding commercial and industrial loan yields and PPP accretion from forgiveness. We ended the
year with fourth quarter 2020 over fourth quarter 2019 average loan growth of $1.9 billion or 8%. Mortgage
warehouse and CRE lending continued to be strong performers during the quarter.
We continue to grow our low-cost deposits which accounted for 64% of total deposits at the end of 2020. The cost
of interest bearing deposits declined significantly throughout the year. During the fourth quarter, the cost of
interest bearing deposits excluding time deposits was just 7 basis points. The provision for credit losses was $17
million during the quarter, down from $43 million in the third quarter. Loan deferrals fell to less than $80 million
and both non-accruals and potential problem loans declined.
Our allowance reserve covered 1.76% of loans at the end of the year. We finished the year on a strong capital
note, tangible book value per share increased to $16.67 and all our regulatory capital ratios were higher year over
year.
On slide 4, we've provided a summary of our 2020 pre-tax pre-provision income. We've also highlighted several
significant initiatives, which we executed over the year and their impact on PTPP. Adjusted for these significant
items, PTPP was $393 million for the year.
On slide 5, we provide a similar view for the fourth quarter. Excluding the gain on sale of branches, fourth quarter
PTPP was $94 million. Average annual loan balance trends are shown on slide 6. Total average loans came in at
$24.5 billion, up $1.4 billion or 6% for the year. PPP lending and CRE activity accounted for most of the year's
growth. Commercial and business lending increased $983 million or 12% from 2019. This was driven by PPP
lending and mortgage warehouse financing. We also continued to reduce our oil and gas exposure to only $296
million at the end of the year. Oil and gas outstandings now represent just a little more than 1% of our total loans.
Average commercial real estate loans grew over $660 million as customers continue to build projects, particularly
industrial and distribution center projects across our footprint. Construction lending has been particularly resilient
in the upper Midwest and our unfunded commercial real estate commitments stood at $1.9 billion at year end,
reflecting a healthy amount of expected further growth as we move into 2021.
We originated a record $4.5 billion of mortgages during the year, driven by the lower mortgage rate environment.
Despite this, average consumer loans finished the year at $9.3 billion down $230 million. The low rate
environment encouraged refinancing activity across our markets and contributed to the further rundown in our
home equity book. We've been reluctant to add low rate mortgages to our balance sheet, but we have benefited
from the sale of originated mortgage loans in the form of mortgage banking fees.
Turning to slide 7, we highlight changes in the quarterly loan trend. Compared to Q4 of 2019, average fourth
quarter loans increased $1.9 billion. Commercial real estate loans increased $963 million and commercial and
4

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
business lending increased $1.2 billion including PPP loans. On a sequential quarter basis, fourth quarter average
loans fell $281 million from the third quarter. This decline was mostly attributable to PPP forgiveness which we
began to see in the fourth quarter. Through year-end about 25% of our PPP loans have been repaid or forgiven.
Looking out to 2021, outstanding 2020 PPP round one and two loans should be largely paid off or forgiven during
the first half. We are currently originating new 2021 round three PPP loans and expect these to peak in Q2 and
then decline toward year-end.
With respect to residential mortgages, we protect balances to be flattish throughout the year as new mortgage
portfolio production and increasing home equity production and utilization are more or less offset by the negative
impacts of the ongoing refi market on these categories.
We are optimistic about commercial loan demand in 2021. Specifically, we expect commercial real estate growth
to continue at a strong pace and to increase average CRE balances by 4% to 6% during the year. We are also
anticipating commercial line utilization expansion that should add 1% to 2% to outstandings, particularly as we
move into the back half of this year.
Taken together, we expect full-year commercial loan growth, that is commercial real estate and commercial and
industrial combined of 2% to 4%.
On slide 8, we've summarized our COVID-19 relief efforts for the year. During the second quarter deferrals
peaked at approximately $1.6 billion. At year-end, deferrals were just $79 million. We saw very positive trends
throughout the year; we're very pleased with where we ended. Most customers who received deferrals have not
needed additional assistance and have been able to resume making normal payments. Total deferrals make up
just 32 basis points of our total loans at year-and. The remaining deferrals are primarily residential mortgage
borrowers that are still in their initial six-month deferral period. We expect substantially all of these consumer
deferrals to be cured or expire without any credit implications in the coming quarter.
Our allowance update is shown on slide 9. We utilized Moody's Dec 2020 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-
looking assumptions. The baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus, continuing low rates through 2023 and a
COVID vaccine that becomes widely available late in this quarter. We had previously indicated that we expected
to taper our reserving as we move through the year and in fact our fourth quarter reflects a net reserve release of
$11 million.
While we set aside $17 million as a provision for the quarter, we also charged up $28 million resulting in a net
lower quarter-over-quarter total allowance. This net release was driven by a $27 million gross reduction in our
allowance related to our general commercial and business lending portfolios. This gross release was partially
offset by $15 million of additional reserves set aside for commercial real estate loans. The commercial real estate
reserves are driven by the fact that our construction loan portfolio has grown by over 30% year-to-date and that
we reserve for the full committed amount on a construction loan at inception. As of December 31, our total
allowance was $431 million, down from $442 million at the end of the third quarter. Similarly, our ratio of reserves
to loans was about flat, 1.76% to 1.77%.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 10. Potential problem loans, nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs all
declined during the quarter. Our key COVID commercial exposures also continue to decline. And notably, our oil
and gas, retail, and restaurant exposure all declined during the quarter. We'd also note that we had no oil and gas
net charge-offs this quarter and we're comforted that with oil prices currently holding above $50 a barrel, we are
5

well reserved going into 2021.Assuming the positive credit dynamics continue, we expect our full year 2021
provision to be no more than $70 million with some quarterly variability.
Turning to slide 11, annual average deposits were $26 billion, up nearly $1.3 billion or 5% over 2019. At the end
of 2020, low-cost deposits grew approximately $3.6 billion compared to the end of 2019. At the same time, we
reduced high-cost time deposits and network deposits by over $1 billion. These are all-time record deposit levels
for associated customers and are a testament to the resiliency of our systems and our ability to continue to attract
and retain core customers in a low rate and largely remote banking environment.
We're also happy to report our customer satisfaction ratings have never been higher. Our customer interaction
and call center survey data suggest our customers have been well-served despite many of our branch lobbies
being closed for part of this year. Further, our mobile applications continue to be refreshed and have been very
well-received by our customers who've given us a 4.8 star rating out of 5 on the most popular mobile platform.
Turning to slide 12. Fourth quarter average deposits were $26.7 billion. Low-cost noninterest bearing and savings
were up from the third quarter, while network and time deposits declined yet again. Low-cost deposits accounted
for nearly 64% of our balances at the end of the year.
Turning to slide 13. Fourth quarter net interest income was $188 million, up $6 million from the third quarter, and
net interest margin of 2.49% was up 18 basis points from the third quarter. We had previously guided that net
interest margin would bottom out during the third quarter and pickup in Q4. As expected, margin hit bottom in July
and August and then rebounded to 2.56% in December. Asset yields benefited from our implementation of LIBOR
floors, reduced investment activity, and generally widening spreads on new loans.
On the liability side, we benefited from lower levels of borrowings driven by the influx of customer deposits which
drove our funding costs down. This persistent customer liquidity encouraged us to repay $1 billion of PPP loan
funding in November. We also aggressively repriced our consumer deposit book yet still have $288 million in 1%
plus CDs which will mature in the first half of 2021. We expect spreads to widen on our LIBOR-based commercial
loans as we continue to implement new LIBOR floors into our new and renewing loans. This will happen over time
or in conjunction with other repricing or credit actions including the anticipated migration to SOFR and other
indices away from LIBOR later in 2021.
We continue to expect to see our margin expand as we move throughout the year. We expect our net interest
margin to be relatively flat in the first quarter and to gradually expand over the course of the second through fourth
quarters. We'd expect the full year's margin to be between 2.55% and 2.65%.
Turning to slide 14, fourth quarter noninterest income came in at $86 million. Mortgage banking, service charges,
and wealth management fees all contributed to this quarter's growth. We also recorded $7 million of deposit
premiums on our previously announced branch sales. Our mortgage banking activity remains strong this quarter
with nearly $340 million of mortgages sold to the agencies, generating $14 million in net fee revenue. We also
picked up nearly $1 million of MSR recovery during the fourth quarter and still have over $17 million in temporarily
impaired MSR at year-end. We expect mortgage banking activity to remain somewhat elevated as we move into
the year.
Service charges and deposit account fees came in at $15 million, an increase of $1 million quarter-over-quarter.
Wealth fees also increased nearly $1 million, reflecting the strong equity market dynamics. On January 5, we
announced the sale of our Whitnell family office subsidiary which constitutes a little less than 10% of the wealth
management revenues and is focused on the ultra-high net worth market. Pro forma for the sale, we retain
6

approximately $12 billion of assets under management. As we look forward in net of the pending Whitnell sale, we
expect noninterest income of $280 million to $300 million in 2021.
On slide 15, we highlight our expenses. The third quarter came in at $173 million inside of the $175 million level
we were targeting. Core expenses continue to trend lower, largely driven by the reduction of expense following
the sale of ABRC and the branch sales which mostly closed in December. We expect the expense initiatives to
provide further savings as we move into 2021. As you can see from the charts on the right, our efficiency trends
continue to improve and our adjusted expenses to average assets ratio is already trending to 2%. Given these
positive dynamics and the pending sale of Whitnell, we're revising our full-year 2021 expense guidance down to
approximately $675 million.
As shown on slide 16, our regulatory capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 23
basis points from the third quarter and has grown 109 basis points from the first quarter as we conserved capital
in light of economic uncertainty. Our TCE ratio grew 44 basis points from the third quarter benefiting from solid
earnings and lower asset levels as we used excess cash to reduce higher cost deposits and our PPP loans began
to be forgiven. As we look forward into 2021, we expect to resume opportunistic share repurchases this quarter.
We will continue to target TCE levels at or above 7.5% and CET1 at or above 9.5%.
So, to wrap up on slide 17, we're providing guidance for 2021. We expect full-year net interest margin of 255
basis points to 265 basis points. We expect mortgage banking revenue to moderate but noninterest income still to
come in between $280 million to $300 million. We're revising our 2021 expense guidance down to approximately
$675 million from the $685 million previously guided. Our provision for credit losses has trended down since the
second quarter to an annualized fourth quarter run rate of about $70 million. With the positive credit trends were
seeing and assuming the economy behaves positively as is generally expected, we believe our 2021 full year
provision will be at or better than $70 million with some quarterly variability. And we expect our annual tax rate to
normalize in the 18% to 21% range.
And with that, we'll be happy to take any of your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please state your question.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Can you hear me?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hi, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, great. Thanks, Phil. Congratulations. I hope you get to really enjoy your last full winter up in Green Bay and
get the most out of it. Congratulations on the next step and we look forward to working with the rest of the team.
I guess maybe starting with the margin. I think that your guidance is pretty good. It's better than what we're seeing
out of most. And would love to hear I guess, where are you seeing the new loan yield? You talked about getting
better spreads and putting in some LIBOR floors. Where are we seeing new loans coming on right now? And do
you think that that's going to be sustainable for the next quarter or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jared. I'll let Chris answer that. But just to what you said, yes, winter is
cooperating. It was 8 degrees here yesterday, so I am still enjoying that.
Chris, do you want to take the NIM question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, Jared, we would point you to – about the slide in the margin page in the deck, page 7 in the tables. I
would say that the core commercial and business lending spreads have widened and it's a combination of the
strategy to have floors inserted in loan. So years ago, they started that sort of phase those out and we've been
reinserting them through the course of the year. And that started to basically lift our core yield on the loans to
8


Associated Banc-Corp

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
spread it. In fact doesn't change is the baseline goes from LIBOR in the teens to something like LIBOR at 50
basis points or 100 basis points, depending upon the type of loan.
And we're seeing a good maintenance of the spreads in commercial real estate with lending. So, not necessarily
widening but not compressing either. And the new loans aren't resulting in material shift to that. And so, the
combination of the new stuff coming on at reasonable spreads in commercial real estate, the slightly better mix of
construction, the total real estate, and the LIBOR floor strategy is really the contributing factors to the expansion
you've seen in that commercial loan yields.
And then as we mentioned – or still mentioned on residential mortgages, we've really been holding the line and
we're not terribly excited about putting to handle mortgages into the portfolio. And so, we've been selling most of
that production to the agencies. And so, the book that we're left with isn't growing but at least it has something in
the neighborhood of a [ph] 1% (25:15) yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great. And then, I'm assuming that that margin guidance assumes the benefit from this initial PPP
loans, but anything coming out of the newest round is not included in that. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So, we've given a full year guidance for the 2.55% to 2.65%, that's sort of a good indicator for the entire year. But
yeah, what I just walked you through on our spreads is all excluding PPP. We break out commercial PPP as a
balance than as a yield and a spread independently for you on all of our tables and materials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. But with the newest round that's coming out, I guess what should we be thinking volume to look like on that
compared to what we saw earlier in, call it, third quarter peak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll take that, Chris. As we...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
...sit right now, we've already received more than 1,000 thousand applications for $150-ish million. I don't know –
It's hard to prognosticate how much there's going to be. We did $1.1 billion in the first two rounds last year. The
rules are a little bit more difficult this time around. So it'll certainly be something less than that. But I – it's kind of
hard to hazard a guess.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Totally get that. And then just shifting to the core loan growth. Looking at your guidance, expecting
1% to 2% increase in C&I. You also talked about utilization improving and giving that 1% or 2% benefit. So is that
really – you're not expecting a lot of necessarily core C&I growth other than an improvement in utilization, is that
the right way to look at it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think you're going to see most of our growth from the big backlog of commercial real estate fundings that
will come. We're sitting at the end of the year at almost $2 billion and there's additional new business there.
Commercial utilization is as you know from looking at other banks across the industry is very low. So we certainly
think as the economy picks up, we'll get more utilization. 1% to 2% maybe a little bit conservative, it's just – it's
hard to know what the general commercial borrower or when the general commercial borrower is going to feel
comfortable stepping up. I think growth will be perhaps stronger in the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess just finally for me looking at the allowance and the CECL impact, looking at the allowance
ex-PPP of $182 million is really strong I guess given the overall quality backdrop. How much did you have to rely
on qualitative overlays this quarter to get there? And is that maybe a reduction of qualitative overlay is going to be
the driving factor behind the provision guidance or does that not change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Chris, you want to take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Did you get the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So, I think – yeah. Jared, in our modeling, it's not so much the qualitative overlay, let's say the qualitative overlays
have kept the reserve level because we try to think about reserve as being countercyclical. And so with an
improving forecast that captured and driven some of the numbers here in our modeling. I think your question is as
you think about that level of provision guidance that we've given you, does that imply perhaps as the total reserve
level is coming down over time? I think the answer to that is yes.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. And Phil, congratulations on the retirement news; it's – I can't believe it's been 11 years, but
congratulations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Let's start on – just on page 2. I'm looking at the personnel expenses which have come down all year and we've
seen that in the expense line. My question is how much of that kind of fell to the bottom line last year and how
much of it was kind of reinvested in the business? I know in the past and maybe I missed it, there was kind of a
technology spend slide and maybe a few others.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Going forward, much of this is falling to the bottom line. We've been able to maintain a fairly stable tech
spend, although we continue to spend significant dollars on that. So this change in personnel costs is really
benefiting the bottom line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then as a follow-up, kind of your COVID watch list portfolio, slide 20 here. Wondering if you could provide
some updated thoughts on some of the larger portfolios, particularly kind of the retailers and the retail REITs that
you've discussed in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. Pat, you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. Right now, we're seeing some stabilization there. The issues we had in the past have all been kind of
circled in large part put behind us. So I think we're seeing in our portfolio, a lot of these retail centers are collecting
more. They're seeing increase in rent. So that's been a positive. The other one that stands out in terms of real
estate is hotels. Obviously, we have a pretty small exposure there relatively speaking. And I would say we've kind
of again circled all the issues and we've kind of put actions in place to continue to monitor those and get those
hopefully through the next 6 to 12, 18 months.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. And Phil, I wanted to add my congratulations as well. I enjoyed working with you and look
forward to this final year, but wish you the best and that's well-earned. I wanted to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Scott. I'm not done yet though, so you probably haven't done – you're not done [ph] talking with them
(31:37) yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. No, fair enough. Fair enough. That's a good point. I guess just on the search and just sort of the timing on
announcement. Was there any thought to wait to announce until you'd kind of gone through the search?
Obviously, it's kind of a dicey thing with disclosure and stuff. But any sense for why now?
And then, M&A has become another topic in the industry. It's gotten a lot more frothy more recently. The search
for a new CEO, did that sort of put you guys off from looking at [ph] internal (32:14) transactions yourself? And
then, I guess, conversely, I guess one way to find a new CEO would be to partner with someone else and source
the CEO that way. Just maybe any broader M&A thoughts you could offer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, a bunch of questions in there. First of all, on timing, I've been discussing this with the board for some
time. And as you point out, at some point, this is material and should be disclosed which is why we're doing it
now. Secondly, I really think that we are very well positioned at this point with all the actions we took last year to
really participate in the economic recovery. So making this announcement now in the face of what we think is a
improving 2021 and improving results for us makes some sense.
As far as M&A, as you've seen us been active over the last few years in acquisitions, we will continue whether it's
me sitting here or perhaps someone else to look at those kind of opportunities. And if we think they're in the
interests of our shareholders, pursue them. And as always, as far as doing something more strategic, the board,
with their responsibility to look out for shareholders, is always open to looking at something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears a bit I guess for Chris, probably most
appropriate for you. But as it relates to PPP, would you mind sort of trying to embed that into what total loan
growth will look like for the year inclusive of the PPP ebbs and flows between all these myriad rounds that are in
there? And then same thing on the margin, how much will PPP forgiveness contribute in your existing guidance?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So I think Scott, if you take a look at the transcript when you go back to it, Phil articulated that we really
expect the bulk of the PPP [ph] that bears today just (34:18) go away. So that's the better part of the remaining
portion and the large portion of round three. So PPP on balance sheet will certainly be a non-material number
probably by the time we get to the end of 2021 in the grand scheme of things. The fees that are remaining for
2021 from the 2020 round, we disclose is $12 million. So there's $12 million of unamortized fees that we're largely
assuming we're going to receive next year. And again, as Phil alluded to, we'll figure out how much the new is, but
it's not going to be on the same order of magnitude as the round one and round twos, right. So it'll be a smaller
number and it'll mostly run through the year. So it'll be a little over $12 million plus whatever happens for round
three is what's basically assumed in the budget or the outlook.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
[ph] Brady (35:47) won't care, but the rest of their team isn't going to like it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I was just going to say similar to [ph] Foxborough (35:51). Well, good luck with that. I'll congratulate you after
probably Q3 earnings. But just a question back on the C&I piece of it, that those balances have been coming
down over the last several quarters. And I just – I'm curious if you're starting to see signs of life there. It sounds
like you're a little more bullish on that later in the year, but are you starting to see some of those balances trough?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We've had some really good success particularly in the fourth quarter with some new customers and some new
closings and the pipelines are encouraging. I mean, that said, low utilization has kind of masked that. So I think
it's still a little early yet. But we believe that vaccines are going to become much more widely available here. And
as the population starts to be able to access that it's going to have a pretty big impact on growth. So as I said, the
1% to 2% is our forecast now but I would think that there's a decent likelihood that that's conservative. But you're
probably going to see it more in later quarters after the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then on the interest-bearing demand growth, if you guys had to put your finger on what's really
driving that, is it environmental? Is it you? And how sticky do you think these balances are longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Chris, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I mean, I would note that the rate on those is blending out at 8 basis points. So they're not being affected by
rate. So we're not – it's not a rate opportunity but I think it is generally the liquidity broadly across our commercial
customer base and across in particular, for these accounts, the municipalities and various government entities
level groups that have balances that have just nowhere else to go with their money in the short run. There aren't
investment options that make too much sense either. And 8 basis points is better than 0. And so I think that's
generally the math that those customers are doing there in these types of accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. And then resuming the repurchase program, I'm just curious in your minds how attractive is that for
you and how aggressive would you like to be. Thanks.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Yeah. So all we can really say on that is we have – what do we have, about $100 million plus of authorization
right now. And even though the stock has somewhat recovered, we're still trading at what would to us, seem an
attractive level to be purchasing stock at. So not going to signal too much about what we're going to do in the first
quarter other than we're going to resume.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Well you issued stock when you showed up and now you're buying it back, right, 11 years later? So
that's good.

Philip B. Flynn A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thanks for the question. I'll follow-up on Jon's well-wishing. So with the Packers won that Super Bowl back close
to when you started there, so hopefully they'll bring one home for the [indiscernible] (39:35).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
That would be a good back – that would be a good book end to this thing because I got here at the end of 2009
and they won the 2010 Super Bowl. So, yeah that would be perfect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. The timing could be unique. Well, anyways maybe just following up on that kind of starting with just a high
level question. You've been here for 10 going on 11 years and just curious with what you've done in terms of
credit cleanup and then efficiency improvement, technology adaptation and rollout for the company through your
career and I'm sure I've missed some things that you accomplished along the way. But what do you see as kind of
the core needs for the franchise going forward from here and just anything that we should be expecting maybe on
a go forward basis?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Yeah. It's a great question. Appreciate that. We've positioned ourselves well from a credit point of view as you
point out. We have a very disciplined credit culture. I think if you look back to March of last year it was very hard
to forecast how this was going to turn out but it appears at this point that this is going to be a very mild credit
cycle. We charged off about 40 basis points of loans last year. We expect something in a similar zip code to that.
And compared to what we were thinking in March, it's pretty mild. Now perhaps not every bank will have those
results but we have relatively modest and broadly diversified exposure. So, yes, I think we're in good shape on
credit. We've invested a lot in tech. Thank goodness, we did that because when we had to handle our customers
remotely, we've had a mobile app that's – that works online works. We've invested a lot of money in this. And
importantly, we still have 3,000 people working from home and we've been able to do things like handle a record
amount of mortgage volume and such.
Going forward, the challenge for us is the same challenge as the whole industry faces. We've got a basically zero
interest rate environment, stretching out for a couple three years. So, it behooves us to continue to work hard on
finding efficiency, so that we can grow our bottom line in that very difficult macro environment. Fortunately, the
economy to us, looks like it's going to improve and that'll give us some tailwind as we get into the year. But doing
things well, doing them efficiently is the biggest challenge we have in this rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate that perspective Phil. And maybe just following up on kind of the loan growth outlook, I think
you mentioned still resi is not super attractive at these yields although maybe better than securities. But it seems
like the swing factor and kind of growth for 2021 outside of just the macro lift in commercial is the ability to start
stabilizing and/or growing kind of the residential book. So, at what point, with the long end of the curve kind of
ticking up, would you be interested in putting that paper on the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Chris, what do you think? I mean you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We would hope so. Yeah. And the resi mortgage book, we've been sort of focused and if you look at this quarter's
yields for the fourth quarter, the resi book had an effective yield of 3%. And that's probably a reasonable level for
us to be adding to that book and certainly a much better yield relative to other security choices that might be
available. And it wouldn't require much of a backup in some products to get back to those levels. So that would
certainly be the level we'd probably start to add some back to the balance sheet.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. This is actually Kelly Motta on Chris. Thanks so much for the questions. Most of what I had has been asked
and answered already, but maybe on liquidity and liquidity management. We've heard that there – from a lot of
banks that there's still going to be a drag from an influx as PPP is forgiven and potentially we get more stimulus.
How should we be thinking about that over the course of 2021 and the size of the balance sheet? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I'll take that, Chris (sic) [Kelly]. If you noticed, the quarterly trend, obviously we and everyone have been
awash in liquidity. But you'll also notice that we've taken some actions to reduce that liquidity. So, we prepaid as
you know in the third quarter the FHLB advance that took a significant amount of cash off the balance sheet. And
this past quarter, we decided to go ahead and repay the Fed PPP facility. That took another $1 billion off. So
we've done some significant things to improve, i.e., reduce the amount of cash we've had. Now as the next round
of stimulus rolls out and customers get PPP loans, liquidity perhaps will build. But we'll continue to look for
opportunities to manage the cash on our balance sheet. You want to add anything to that, Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, I think you covered it. I think we've reduced that as Phil alluded to, not only the $950 million of FHLB
advances that we repaid in the third quarter but year-over-year over $1.5 billion. So we've really put a lot of that –
when you look at the total year-over-year, deposits are up $2.7 billion and we repaid $1.5 billion of Federal Home
Loan Bank and as Phil alluded to, another $1 billion of PPP [ph] alone (46:03). So we really sort of put the money
out to offset other liabilities in an effective way.
