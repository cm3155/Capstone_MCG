MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Joint South State Corporation and CenterState Bank Corporation
Quarterly Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode for the first part of the call. Later, we
will open the line for questions with the research analyst community.
I will now turn the call over to Will Matthews, CenterState Bank Corporation Chief Financial Officer. Please go
ahead.

William E. Matthews
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Good morning and welcome. Thank you for joining us. This is Will Matthews. And joining me on this call are
Robert Hill, John Corbett, John Pollock, Steve Young, Richard Murray, Dan Bockhorst, and Jonathan Kivett.
Given our pending merger, we thought it appropriate to hold a joint conference call to discuss our first quarter
results in order to facilitate the sharing of information that may be of interest to investors in both companies.
Let me first state that we are of course still operating two companies separately and will continue to do so through
closing. While we are managing two separate companies, we are actively engaged in integration planning and
believe we're making great progress on these plans. And we look forward to becoming one company officially on
the same team upon closing. The format of this call will be that we will each provide prepared remarks about our
individual company's performance and will then open it up for questions which we will take jointly. We will ask
when you have a question that you direct it to either a person, a company or both.
Given our inability to travel due to the coronavirus, we're each calling in from different locations. We hope the
technology and our operation thereof will cooperate. And we thank you in advance for your patience with the
difficulties presented by holding a teleconference with multiple speakers from multiple locations and phone lines.
Yesterday evening, each company issued a press release to announce its earnings for Q1 2020. We've also each
posted presentation slides that we will refer to on today's call on each company's Investor Relations website.
Before we begin our remarks, I want to remind you that comments made by management teams of both South
State and CenterState may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These such forward-looking statements we may make are subject to the safe
harbor rules. Please review the forward-looking disclaimer and safe harbor language in today's press release and
presentation for more information about risks and uncertainties which may affect us.
Now, I will turn the call over to John Corbett. He and I will deliver CenterState's prepared remarks. After which, we
will turn over to Robert Hill to lead the South State team through his comments. We'll then take joint Q&A. John?

John C. Corbett
President & Chief Executive Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thank you, Will. Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us this morning. I hope you and your families
are remaining healthy and safe. I'm going to share some high-level observations on our business performance,

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
talk about our efforts to support our employees and clients during this humanitarian crisis, and then also give you
an update on our pending merger.
For the first quarter of 2020, CenterState produced $35 million in after-tax earnings. This is after an elevated
CECL provision of $45 million as a result of the pandemic. Even after the special loan loss reserve, the company
still produced a return on tangible common equity of about 10%. Capital levels remained strong with the tangible
common equity at 9.1%.
In response to the pandemic, both Will and Steve have begun stressing our capital position on a pro forma basis
with South State Bank to confirm our ability to travel through this cycle without impacting our dividend or common
equity. Together with South State, we enter this downturn with a much stronger pre-tax pre-provision earnings
than a decade ago, a conservatively underwritten credit book with significant borrower equity and surplus capital.
Fee income continues to be a bright spot as the drop in interest rates provide a tailwind to both our capital
markets business and mortgage business. Both of these businesses are operating at record levels of sales and
profitability. Fee income now represents 1.3% of assets which is above our 1% goal.
The liquidity of the company is also strong with over a billion dollars in cash and Fed funds driven by non-CD
deposit growth of 13% during the quarter. As for asset quality, CenterState ended the quarter in good shape with
an NPA ratio of 48 basis points and only 5 basis points of net charge offs. While bottom line earnings are always
important, other more urgent priorities took center stage in March and April as we quickly shifted our attention to
the health and safety of our teammates and providing financial relief to our clients during the mandatory
shutdown.
We kept our branches open during the shutdown, but we moved quickly to limit them to drive-through service only
to reduce the exposure of the virus to our branch employees. 93% of the remaining non-branch staff have been
working from home ever since. Fortunately, our teams have experience working from home during hurricane
season, when there are also mandatory closures. Despite the personal hardships on our team, they were eager to
provide financial relief to our clients.
In times of crisis or when our clients depend on us the most and we can really make a difference in their lives.
Early in the shutdown, our relationship managers and branch managers began an organized calling campaign to
proactively offer assistance to those that are the most vulnerable. We offered loan payment deferrals, fee waivers
for ATM and CD withdrawals. We increased our mobile deposit limits and began ramping up the process to
distribute paycheck protection loans to struggling small business clients.
I like to suggest that it's time to rethink the term bankers' hours. When I started in this business 30 years ago, I
had a preconceived notion, like many, of a 9-to-5 work day and golf at the country club in the afternoon. Nobody
predicted that bankers' hours in 2020 would be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with bankers at their desks after
midnight.
That is precisely what occurred in the two weeks after the PPP forgivable loan program was launched by the
SBA. Easter weekend was the crucible, as our bankers at CenterState worked around the clock and processed
2,800 loans to the SBA for loan proceeds of $0.5 billion in just two days, Saturday and Easter Sunday. To put that
in perspective, that is three times the volume of loans that we generated a month and our team did it over a
holiday weekend.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Since the program launched, CenterState secured in total nearly 7,000 loans for $1.1 billion of cash flow relief for
our small business clients. The largest loan was $6 million and the smallest was just $1,170. Borrowers included
everything from doctors to plumbers to retail stores and to churches and schools.
In all, CenterState secured continued paychecks for 130,000 workers. And I'd like to publicly express my pride
and appreciation to our team for their patriotism during the national crisis. They stepped up and they were there
for our clients in a time of need.
Finally, I'm happy to announce that the merger between CenterState Bank and South State Bank is proceeding as
planned. We filed the S-4 and that we have scheduled the shareholder vote for May 21.We feel confident that the
merger will close on schedule in the third quarter and there's also a small chance we could complete the merger
ahead of schedule.
Our joint South State and CenterState executive team began working together as one leadership team before the
announcement in January and we continue to meet every Wednesday to integrate the two companies even during
this crisis. Periods like this of crisis and stress can be times when new teams are fragmented and people are
driven apart or they can be opportunities when new teams are strengthened through the trials that they overcome
together.
As our newly combined executive team with South State collaborated through the crisis, the silver lining is that our
personal relationships and our trust in one another have grown stronger. We are eager to move forward to serve
our clients and communities and to produce generous returns for our shareholders and to do it together as one
high-performing company.
Will, over to you for more color on the first quarter financials.

William E. Matthews
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thanks, John. Our net interest margin was 4.17%, down 8 basis points from Q4. Our core NIM, excluding all
accretion, was 3.74%, down 3 basis points. Loan yields ex-accretion were down 9 basis points. Interest-bearing
deposit costs were down 10 basis points. And our teams made good progress again in March after the rate cuts,
with a record quarter for revenue in spite of one fewer day and $2.3 million in lower accretion income versus Q4
driven by our noninterest income businesses.
Our correspondent business, which is capital markets and fixed income, had $27.8 million in revenue. Mortgage
had a great quarter as well with revenue of $11 million.
Turning to credit and CECL. We had non-PCD net charge-offs of $1.1 million or 4 basis points annualized with
total net charge-offs of $1.4 million, or 5 basis points. Non-accrual loans ended at $79.4 million with the new
accounting treatment of PCD loans, bringing ending NPAs to assets to 48 basis points. Absent the accounting
change, the non-performing ratios were in line with the previous four quarters.
Our initial CECL reserve was $115 million, or 96 basis points plus an additional $6 million for unfunded
commitments. Additionally at quarter-end and in light of the impact of the coronavirus on economic forecasts, we
made it Q1 provision for credit losses of $44.9 million plus an additional $1 million expense to increase the
reserve for unfunded commitments for a total expense of $45.9 million in spite of us only recognizing $1.4 million
in net charge-off during the quarter and essentially having very little loan growth.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
This brings our ending allowance for credit losses to $158.7 million, or 1.32%. This represents a 37.7% increase
over the day one CECL adoption allowance. Including the reserve for unfunded commitments which resides on
the liability side of the balance sheet, this would be 138 basis points. We also have on the balance sheet a
remaining non-credit discount of $81.2 million for purchase loans as is disclosed on page 6 of the earnings
release.
Turning to non-interest expenses, our efficiency ratio was 54.9% adjusted. Relative to Q4 2019, our
compensation expense was up $4.1 million including $2.9 million in higher health insurance as we have a self-
insured, high-deductible plan, so Q1 expense estimates are often higher, and $1 million in higher FICA expense
in Q1 versus Q4 2019 due to the annual resetting of the FICA cap. Also included in our other NIE line is the $
1million expense to increase CECL reserve for unfunded commitments. And our FDIC assessment expense was
up $1.1 million versus Q4.
In terms of our tax rate, we recognized the $2.3 million benefit from the ability under the Cares Act to carry back
NOLs to prior years with a higher tax rate. We also had some equity comp payout in the first quarter and
recognized $1.4 million in excess tax benefits from that.
Turning to capital formation, we reported an ROTCE of 9.9% in spite of the $46 million provision for credit losses
and unfunded commitments in the quarter. And while we did grow the balance sheet to add some liquidity and
had 13% non-CD deposit growth and 17% DDA growth, our loan growth was only 1%. So loan growth did not
consume capital in Q1. While margins for the industry will feel pressure in this zero rate environment which will
impact our profitability of course, we're pleased we were able to earn an almost 10% ROTCE in a quarter with this
kind of credit cost and that we earned over $90 million in pre-tax, pre-provision income in the quarter.
This equates to a pre pre-ROA of 2.09%. We're also pleased that we ended the quarter with a TCE ratio north of
9% on the heels of CECL adoption and a higher Q1 CECL provision expense. Though a strong capital position,
good core deposit growth, strong pre pre-performance and a healthy addition to our allowance during the quarter
with a respectable ROTCE of almost 10% after all of that.
I'll now turn it over to Robert.

Robert R. Hill Jr.
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be with you today and hope that you, your co-workers and your families are well.
Our first quarter was strong, with record revenues, solid loan and deposit growth and a strengthened balance
sheet with added liquidity and increased provisioning for loan losses.
Our pre-provisioned earnings were record levels. We felt that preparation for the economic environment ahead of
us was very important. We therefore bolstered our loan loss provision by approximately $36 million. John Pollock
will provide more color on our financial results in just a minute and I will start by sharing the way our bank is
leading and managing through this period.
Our bank is a reflection of the people, businesses, and communities we serve. When they are going through
tough times, it is our job to be part of the solution. This has been the foundation of our culture since the bank was
started on the heels of the Great Depression and it continues to this day. Our bankers have served and sacrificed
in the last few weeks to support our customers like never before. Beginning in late February, our crisis response
team was activated in response to COVID-19. This team has guided us successfully through a number of natural
disasters. And while this crisis is different, the experience gained from past disasters is invaluable.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
I would like to talk about where our focus has been these past few weeks and what we're doing to prepare for
more challenging future. Throughout this period, we remain committed to making decisions based upon a long-
term view and we see this as a time where relationships can be forged for decades to come. Our focus is in two
main areas our team and our customers.
Let me start with our team. In addition to the ongoing efforts of running the company, our team has been working
around the clock to assist customers all the while we're still working to merge our two great companies in the third
quarter of this year. I'm very proud of our team and enormously grateful for how they've handled this crisis.
Throughout the company, the stories of sacrifice are incredibly inspiring. The South State team has responded to
the call as strong as we've been in the past, we've never been stronger in the team than we are today. With 80%
of our employees working from home and certain branch and support teams continue to work at their respective
locations with almost all of our branches open and providing drive-through service. We have been fortunate to
have just a few employees impacted by COVID-19.
As it relates to our customers, while we're not on the healthcare frontlines, we are among the economic first
responders. We are companies whose deposits and loan relationships are made up of hundreds of thousands of
individuals and businesses. This crisis knows no boundaries and is impacting small and medium-sized
businesses and their employees across our footprint. Providing customer access to our bankers and our branches
has been our top priority. We have expanded our outreach both in person and digitally and have experienced a
significant increase in our digital delivery channels.
Early on, we mobilize task forces in both our consumer and commercial areas to develop responses to customer
needs. We have found that in times of crisis, communication is even more important. Job one was to proactively
call our customers and understand how they are positioned to weather the storm. Much of the efforts today had
been focused on providing principal and interest deferrals to consumer and commercial customers and facilitating
loans for small businesses through the PPP program. We took a proactive approach with 90-day payment
deferrals for areas most impacted.
We've processed principal and interest deferrals of approximately 4% of our notes and 20% of total principal
balances. These deferrals were not made because of the inability to pay, but instead these deferrals allow us to
have a more constructive dialog with our customers and to work together to manage through this environment.
And regarding the PPP program, our team has worked around the clock for weeks to support existing customers
and welcome new customers to our bank. To date, we have assisted almost 6,000 small businesses through the
program for a total of approximately $900 million. The average loan size is about $150,000. We have a great
opportunity to assist those in need. And as other programs are developed, we stand ready to deliver them to our
customers.
South State enters this period in very good financial health. Our operating principles have always been
soundness, profitability, and growth. Soundness speaks to capital strength, core deposit funding, liquidity and a
granular and high-quality loan portfolio. While this crisis is certainly different than others we have faced, in many
ways we have been making decisions in preparation for this crisis for decades.
Finally, I want to thank both the CenterState and South State teams. While we continue to operate and serve our
customers separately during this time, we are becoming stronger as one team. This crisis we're experiencing
today makes the opportunity we have together even more compelling and confirms that this is the right
partnership for our banks and for the opportunities ahead.

I will now turn the call over to John Pollok to discuss South State first quarter financial results in detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, our teams have been very active risk managers ensuring that we are
taking care of the needs of our great customer base and our shareholders. Our earnings this quarter were
impacted by sizable provision of loan losses under the new implemented CECL standard due to a very different
economic forecast than what we first imagined at the start of the year.
Our provision for loan losses this quarter totaled $36.5 million as compared to $3.6 million last quarter. With much
of the attention returning to asset quality, we have added some slides this quarter to help give you some insight
into the various segments of our loan portfolio, and Jonathan Kivett, our Chief Credit Officer will speak to many of
these during the Q&A session. We begin this economic downturn with what we believe is a very solid balance
sheet with strong levels of liquidity and capital.
Beginning with slide number 16, our net income totaled $24.1 million, or $0.71 per share. Excluding merger
expenses, adjusted net income totaled $27.6 million or $0.82 per share. Without the impact of a much higher
provision for future loan losses, our performance was very strong with growth in total revenues, as net interest
income and non-interest income improved $1.6 million and $7.8 million respectively.
On slide number 17, you can see our net interest margin increased 4 basis points linked-quarter at 3.68%, as the
yield on earning assets was unchanged and our cost of funds declined 4 basis points. Total interest earning
assets advanced a little over $200 million with average loan growth of over $140 million as seen on slide number
18.
During mid-March with uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 increasing, we added to our liquidity position with
new borrowings totaling $500 million. We anticipate much of our loan demand during the second quarter will be
under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program with a current pipeline of $900 million.
Turning to slide number 19, you can see our accretion income totaled $10.9 million, up $3.5 million, as the result
of the adoption of CECL and the change from pool accounting. In the absence of pool accounting, any discount
remaining on acquired loans will be accreted in as these loans pay down, renew, or mature. Then on slide
number 20, you can see the $52 million discount that remains on this $2 billion acquired portfolio.
Turning to slide number 21, noninterest income increased by $7.8 million this quarter with mortgage banking
income $10.9 million higher; of this amount, secondary market income was $4.8 million higher and our mortgage
servicing-related income was higher by $6.1 million. The mortgage servicing rights income was unusually high as
the hedge gains significantly outpaced the decline in the fair value of the asset. This is the result of the 10-year
treasury yield declining much more significantly than the overall mortgage rates during the period.
Lower mortgage rates, of course, significantly increased the application activity, and our team has done a
fantastic job processing this additional volume. Acquired loan recoveries no longer contribute to noninterest
income in the post-CECL world, but totaled $1.2 million this quarter and now flowed through the loan loss
provision. Wealth management income was $500,000 higher this quarter, and our capital markets group had a
strong quarter of back-to-back swap activity during this declining rate environment.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
On slide number 22, you can see the net changes in all noninterest expense categories. Excluding merger-related
expenses, adjusted noninterest expense increased $4 million, about $2 million of which resulted in higher FICA
taxes in the New Year. The other expense category was also higher by $2.4 million as it related to higher
amortization expense of passive loss investments which has a positive impact on the income tax expense.
Slide number 23 shows our efficiency ratio increase slightly to 62.1% from 61.6% last quarter. Adjusted for
merger expenses, the efficiency ratio decreased to 59.7% from 60.7% primarily due to a $9.3 million increase in
total revenues.
Tangible book value as shown on slide number 24 declined $1.12 linked-quarter, primarily due to the adoption of
CECL. Until the impacts of the COVID-19 on our economy are in the rearview mirror, we do not anticipate any
share purchase reactivity at this time.
I will now turn the call over to John Corbett, CEO of CenterState.

As a reminder, we are conducting this call remotely and I ask that you please direct your question to the
appropriate individual you would like to respond. This concludes our prepared remarks, and I would like to ask the

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from
Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good, morning everyone. I guess my first question would be maybe for both teams, but I guess, maybe first
for South State. I noticed 100% of the lodging portfolio on the deferral. I'm wondering with that portfolio as well
maybe all of the deferred loans in particular, how much of that was you guys reaching out to customers versus
inbound calls requesting deferrals? And then why you think there haven't been more deferrals as a percentage
basis for the consumer kind of resi book as seen kind of various things and different companies this quarter that
seemed like a pretty large percentage at like 89% on the commercial side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Stephen, this is Robert. I'll start, and then we've got Jonathan Kivett, our Chief Credit Officer out. I'll turn it over to
him. But I think you can take multiple strategies on these – on deferrals. So when we use certain segments, we're
going to get hit, we were talking to customers instantly. And these are like – taking 0the hotel book for example,
these aren't national hotel operators, these are local operators who mostly raise local equity with local investors
and have really good liquidity and little loan to banks. So, we know these people very well. So, we engage with
them. In what in a needs-based approach it was really – we know that the next 90 days are going to be tougher
for the hotel industry, plus deferral for 90 days. During that time, let's engage, let's get information, let's make sure
we understand liquidity position, what you take the breakeven and how we come up for air in the next 90 days.

So, that was the philosophy behind it. So it was – I'd say really all proactive on our part to help those customers
kind of bridge the gap to get to the other side.
Jonathan, I'd turn it over to you for any additional color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan S. Kivett A
Chief Credit Officer, South State Corp.
No, I think that's right, Robert. The numbers of the commercial at 90% or almost exclusively based on outbound
calling just being proactive, particularly in those industries, the hotels, retail and restaurant industries. I think on
the consumer book, I think the reason those numbers are a little bit lower is that that is more reactive. We just
haven't been as proactive in making those outbound calls.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And maybe, I don't know, Will, if you might get to comment on kind of the similar ideology in terms of the
deferrals and thoughts on consumer deferrals moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
That's probably better answered by John or Dan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
President & Chief Executive Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
President & Chief Executive Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Stephen, this is John. Dan – many of you don't know Dan. Dan has been the Chief Credit Officer here at
CenterState for about a decade. Prior to that, Dan was the Head of Special Assets for RBC for Florida. And then
even before that, he worked with Richard and Will back at the Alabama National. So Dan has been with us in a
combined team for a long, long time. Dan, do you want to address that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yes. Very similar to what Robert and John has indicated, very proactive on the commercial side and more
reactive on the consumer side and expect that the consumer side will continue to be somewhat stable and muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So again you don't expect to see any increases on the consumer side, resi mortgage, I guess, auto? I
mean, do you think that could continue to escalate throughout the coming quarter?

Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
We've seen a noticeable kind of leveling in drop off of the deferral request. Those that have been impacted has
been impacted already. We have very little exposure on consumer side for auto or any other smaller dollar
consumer-type loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then maybe I don't know if this is Will or John, but curious if you give us any kind
of visibility and I know this is hard input. So, where do you think the combined NIM could basically shake out at
this point. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts obviously heading to the next quarter with rates. But just kind of –
get some kind of directional thoughts on where they combine them together, how we can think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
President & Chief Executive Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Stephen. This is John, I'm going to let Steve Young answer that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Sure. Hi. Stephen. Both – I don't want to speak for South State here, but from a CenterState perspective, we were
pretty pleased with how the NIM is shaping out this quarter. The core NIM was only now 3 basis points. And I
think that really reflects, if we couldn't – we can't help what's going on the asset side. But there is a real discipline
from those banks around our core funding as well as we can control, we can control. So there's been a lot of
efforts to reduce rates on the deposit side. So yes, to give a projection from here is difficult as we know because
of the environment although I'm certain. But I guess from a – if we look backwards, I think, we're really pleased at
CenterState on how the core margin.
I think we were 374 and maybe John Pollock, he will talk to South State's margin in the past. But obviously in the
future, margin is going to be a little bit more challenging. But I do think the balance sheets are a little bit bigger
which will help offset some of that.
But John, do you have any comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Sure, I appreciate the question Stephen. I'd say a couple of things. I think first, as we've talked a lot about over
the past six months, as we knew going into the first quarter of this year, the impact of CECL on our margin. As
we've talked about the discount now, it's coming through faster. I think a slide that you ought to look at, Steven,
really is in both decks. As you know, on page 20 of both of our decks we show you the discount. So that discount
that we each have $52 million for us, about $81 million for CenterState, that accretion is going to keep coming
through and it's going to come through probably faster. So that clearly is having a positive impact on the margin.
Now, as we all know, there's clearly going to be pressure with the way rates have come down. But let's talk about
the funding side a second. So you can kind of see in terms of our cost of funds kind of for the quarter has gotten
down to 59 basis points. Well, if you look at March now just kind of carve-out, March was down to 53. So we're
seeing really on the funding side a lot of relief there. We're getting tons of funding. In fact our deposits are up over
$1 billion since the end of the quarter. And then obviously we got these PPP loans that will come through. We
11


South State Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
both got a big slug of that. So trying to model that, Steven, the fees are going to run through the margin. 70% of
those loans probably get forgiven in the next few months and then you'll kind of have a tail off of that. So definitely
a lot of moving pieces around that, but got to have good core funding in this environment. And we continue to see
good opportunities. I think as both teams mentioned, we played some offense on the PPP side to get new
customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And maybe just one last one from me. Curious, John, maybe if you could comment on expectations
around service charge revenue? Obviously that's a pretty big chunk of noninterest revenue for you guys. I'm just
curious how you think that could play out with maybe fees being forgiven or less activity on cards and other things
of that nature?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
This is John Pollok. I guess I'll start with that. I'd say, let's just think about the PPP piece for a minute is, we're
going to be after expenses north of $20 million. Now, that doesn't – these contracts are written in pencil, right, so
the rules continue to change. So are we going to have to put up a loan loss reserve? Stephen, I'm not 100% sure,
but $20-plus million in fees clearly pays a lot of bills that we've all been experiencing. I know CenterState could
comment on that number. But clearly, that's going to help in terms of trying to pay for all that.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q

And yeah, I guess, I meant more like deposit account fees and just like directionally if that – if we should see a big
drop off there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Well, we'll be tougher. I mean, clearly, the consumer is out less. The bottom line is the unemployment rate is
going to drive a lot of these things with the charge-offs or with the fee income is. The consumer is clearly getting a
lot more cash right now. They've gotten a few stimulus checks, but I think you're seeing, with all people, they're
kind of being little bit more stingy with their cash and kind of holding on to that. But yeah it should have some
impact, I would think on these, Stephen.

John C. Corbett A
President & Chief Executive Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to see – and maybe we can, I guess, I'll direct it maybe to John first and then to Will, just to talk about
the economic assumptions that went into your calculation for the provision and your reserve build this quarter?
And then how do you think about how maybe some of those economic assumptions have changed since quarter-
end, just kind of help us get a sense as to how you're thinking about what kind of level of future reserve builds that
we may see? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Well, this is John. I'll start, Catherine. When we have developed our CECL model, we used Moody's Analytics
kind of for the economic forecast. So obviously, Moody's has put out three different forecasts, one on the March
10, March 20 and then the March 27. And then we didn't really get the final until April 2. So we're kind of using the
Moody's baseline COVID-19. It's got clearly a recession in the first part of the year, unemployment going up to 9%
in the second quarter and it was kind of a peak to trough GDP about negative 6%; hopefully a partial bounce back
in the third quarter.
And then I think the key number in that forecast is, when does employment come back? And in that forecast it's
2023. So you kind of have that. They kind of helps you accumulate the data. I'd say Catherine, so you got that
piece. I think how we're thinking about it, clearly predicting the future is a complete guess in this environment.
Nobody really knows today. I think unemployment is clearly the key. It was the key last time. How unemployment
goes, it's how past dues are going to go, and how defaults are going to go?
We've obviously had an instant shock of supply and demand. And then finally, a lot of people like to use letters.
Well we clearly don't think it's a V. I hope it's not an L. It feels like it's more of a – kind of a wider U or it might be a
W. And what I mean by W is stimulus comes in, we kind of see an uptick, and then we see a downtick as we kind
of rationalize some of these businesses. So, that's how we kind of think about it. I think in the second quarter,
clearly, I guess I'm going to get three more forecasts from Moody's this quarter. So, I'm sure that'll all be a little
different. But I think our view is we would continue to see some pressure in the second quarter, but still a bit of
time to play out. So with that, I'll kind of toss it over to, Will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Thanks, John. Yeah. Catherine, our models are not exactly the same, but they share a lot of the same
components. We also used the Moody's baseline COVID-19 forecast. And as John said, that has been changing
on a very rapid basis. And then within that, the factors that are probably most correlated with loan defaults and
provision expense would be unemployment, number one, housing price index, CRE price index, homeowner
vacancy rate, things like that.
And I'll echo what John said. What I think a lot of other banks have said which is that at March 31 based on the
information available everybody felt that their provision was appropriate and their allowance was appropriate. If

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
we get the same type of changes, daily, weekly that we've gotten before, it's likely that we get around to June 30,
you'll see the industry, ourselves included, continue to build reserves because it doesn't look like the economic
forecast at this point are getting any brighter.
Last comment, I'll make is just to remind ourselves as much as you that these are models and built-off historical
data, in many cases different underwriting practices going into them. Today, it's a geography question because
the capital move from Tier 1 to Tier 2. And our hope is that it doesn't flush out of Tier 2 into losses. But time will
tell and our ability to manage through the crisis will govern that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe a follow up is as you're thinking about the merger, any updated
thoughts on how you're kind of thinking about CenterState's loan mark and kind of balancing reserve builds from
this quarter and next quarter before the deal closes versus an updated mark upon closure? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Catherine, I'll start with that and John may jump in. We've been talking together on this. As we just alluded
to, the economy has changed a lot since we first modeled this deal when we announced it in late-January. And
we will model our book at close, and so that's the proper way to do it. And certainly as times are changing like
this, you need to wait until close. But clearly and logically, given the change in the economic forecasts, the credit
mark should increase from what we originally modeled.
Additionally, it's likely that the percentage of PCD loans would also increase which would mean that the double
counting impact of the non-PCD loans would decrease. CDI is likely to be lower today than it was before. Rate
mark is likely to be lower today than it would have been before. So if that's all still true at close, those are some of
the directional impacts.
I'll also remind you, just looking back to our modeling though, our combined CECL reserves, the two companies at
March 31 were some $105 million higher than what was in the original merger model. So we're not yet ready to
say what the revised marks will be, and we won't really be able to do that until we're at close. But those are
directionally, I think, where you should be thinking about it.
John, do you have any additions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.

Good, Michael.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Just wanted to dig in for the restaurant book a little bit, I know some of the markets in Florida, John, are
obviously diverse. Orlando a little bit more travel and tourism. Tampa a little bit more business oriented. But I
guess I was a little bit surprised to only see 35% deferral at this point. So can you give a little color on – and I'm
sorry if I missed it, but on the concepts, the split between fast casual and maybe fast food and et cetera just any
sort of color there would be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Sure. The nice thing is we're going into this without concentration there, I think it's 3% – a little bit less than 3%,
but I'll ask Dan to address. Dan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Maybe kind of some overview on the restaurant side. Our top two exposures are Darden and1 three of the
top 10 are Darden. We have good strong guarantors. If you look at the top 25 credits, 7 requested deferrals, four
of those, the guarantors have high seven figures or higher liquidity and so we are seeing a little bit of borrowers,
guarantors, expecting a deferral when there is probably not short-term need for that based on that guarantor
support. And we do skew [indiscernible] (00:42:55) some of those type restaurant credits as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just on the retail CRE book which is obviously a little bit bigger, 23%
on deferral. Can you give some color there on whether it's type of store, location, geography breakdown. Just a
little bit more color you guys are comfortable on why you feel that that portfolio will hold up? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Happy to do that. I think our disciplined underwriting and approach to lending would pay off especially in
this sector. Our guiding principles have always been cash equity, guarantor liquidity, dealing with borrowers who
are successful in the last downturn, relationship driven. Our typical center is a neighborhood center. It's going to
be in dense markets with barriers to entry.
A good example would be a neighborhood center in [indiscernible] (00:44:00) town. We've got the [indiscernible]
(00:44:02) on one side, the Everglades on the other. That's going to be dense. And the demand for services will
continue for the long-term. A good example of some of the tenant exposure in these types of centers, Dollar

General, Pizza Hut, Allstate Insurance, they're all on the top 10. These are national type tenants that are going to
have long-term need to these local communities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Maybe just one final one from me. Just maybe for Steve on the correspondent banking business, obviously
some good numbers this quarter. Just in the very near term, would you expect any sort of change in activity levels
within the various components of the business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thanks, Michael. Yeah, just to back up for a second, on the correspondent, really just on the fee income
businesses that John and Will both talked about. Yeah, big picture, a few years ago, we wanted to make sure we
built the bank to have diversified revenue streams in any rate environment. And just if you look at this quarter, our
net interest income to revenue was around 73%, which means we have 27% worth of non-interest income. A year
ago, March of 2019, our net interest income represented 80% of our revenue. So what it does is it really hedges,
the business has really hedged the downside risk to margin and rates.
As it relates to correspondent, it's a record quarter. Our interest rate swap business was up from the fourth
quarter which was a record quarter about $2.9 million. We also were pleased to see our fixed income business
increased about $1.7 million, so that was about $4.5 million is your number there. In the future, as we think about
it, coming off a record quarter, I'm not going to be able to do that every quarter, but we think the fixed incomes to
continue to be a real positive. The interest rate swap business will slow down as new purchases will not be as
robust. We will have to refinance this, but we see that business slowing down some, but still at a higher elevated
pace. So, hopefully, that helps you.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Hi, Chris. This is John. Jonathan, do you want to take a stab at that, and then maybe Dan can follow up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan S. Kivett A
Chief Credit Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Sure. I think, initially, we're not going to see that change in grade. I think over time and I think as the
question is, how long is it going to take? I would say over the next two quarters, you're going to start to see that
catch up. So, most of our borrowers are under a 90-day P&I deferral. So, that P&I deferral, probably the vintage in
that is call it mid-March. So you're talking about mid-June for the deferrals to come to an end, and then we're
going to obviously be having ongoing conversations. But I think at the end of that deferral period, you're going to
have – so call it late second quarter, early third quarter, you're going to really start to know. And hopefully we're a
little further through this pandemic, we got a better understanding of how the economy is going to get kicked back
into gear, and the long-term outlook for some of these businesses is going to be better – of these industries. So,
we'll know a lot better. So I think Q2, end of Q2 might be a little early, but I'm certainly thinking that Q3 will have a
real good gauge on long-term prospects and grades.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Dan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. I'll echo some of the same timing. As Jonathan remind everybody from a regulatory perspective, the
regulators gave guidance that six months was kind of a timeframe that they were looking at before something
would be classified as a PDR. The majority of ours are in a 90-day deferral. At the end of that 90 days, we'll
evaluate if another 90 days is needed. At that time, maybe there's an opportunity to shore up with additional
collateral, additional guarantor support. I would say that a lot of the ones that are getting deferrals do have solid
guarantor support with strong liquidity, but we don't think there's going to be significant impact to the risk
weighting long-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
And Chris this is Robert. I'd just kind of add on to what they said. I think trying to draw correlation between
deferral and loss or problem loans at this stage is just not really a leap you can make. I think it's a unique
situation. We're handling some industries in a unique way. But I think as Dan said well, the guarantor support and
the liquidity that they have, we feel really good about. In fact, the larger ones are the ones that are really well-
positioned. And most of these have significant equity and significant guarantor strength. So some of the smaller
ones actually could be the ones that struggle, so I think that's why it gets back to trying to make a correlation
between the two.
Most of our markets don't have significant COVID impact. It's not Manhattan, so – where you've obviously got –
you've got a significant impact. So we feel like over a certain period of time, these businesses will begin to reopen
and be able to operate and pay principal interest on the normal payment without having 80% occupancy like they
have used to. So I think that's why we felt like we needed a proactive, engaged approach with the customer. It
was just a better approach. And I just think it's way too early to try to draw a correlation between the deferrals and
any future problem asset.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Will, does all that's going on right now with the pandemic and the shutdown. Does that change at all the timing on
the merger cost saving? Now you said the closing should happen on time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Jennifer. I think, you're going to hear a theme depending upon how many questions we take today that will
state couple of things. One, we're focused on our teams and we're focused on our customers. And you also hear
us say that we think this is a pretty significant opportunity, really a generational opportunity for us to seize the
moment to strengthen our bonds with our customers and with our team members.
And obviously as John alluded to when he talked about the PPP process, we've had to all convert an assembly
line that's used to churning out certain number of larger units per day. And the one churning out multiple, multiple,
multiple numbers of smaller units with different forms and whatnot a day and done a great job of doing that.
So we've been focused on those things. So we have delayed some of our integration planning as part of that
where – but if you recall from our earlier announcement, we weren't expecting to see much of the bulk of the cost
saves until sometime mid next year. We do have a conversion date as you see in the deck in the early second
quarter of next year. We are sometimes to second quarter. That is really going to drive a lot of the cost saves. So
while I think we're more focused right now on taking this opportunity to build bonds with two very important
constituents, we are still very focused on the benefits that this merger forged us in cost saves to both institution
particularly in time where pre-tax pre-provision income may be more challenging for some. We are very, very glad
to have that opportunity to help boost our profitability when we get through conversion.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, Jennifer. This is John and maybe Robert will have a thought here as well. My guess is that this pandemic is
going to change and accelerate the way a lot of things occur. And I think it really will be an acceleration of an
adoption of the digital channels that we've all been working towards. So I don't know if there's anything immediate
in our thought process relative to branches, but I do see an acceleration of the path that we were already on.
Robert anything to add there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Somewhat to John's comment, I mean I think, Jennifer, just to maybe talk about just the deal overall, not just the
expense save number is. I think what John and I were talking about this over the last couple of years, we kind of
both felt that we were at the end of the cycle. Now we obviously, with what we're going through right now, nobody
could have recognized. But clearly we were in the cycle. And one of the things that we had hoped putting our
companies together was that we could – whatever economic downturn there was be it deeper or shallow that we
would come out the other side stronger. So there's kind of the short-term economic impact and then we have an
opportunity to manage through.
There's the long-term change in the whole business model. And we're hearing that not just from ourselves and
our bank, but from our customers as well. They're looking at the short-term economic impact, but the long-term
structural impact for their businesses. So one of our challenges was how do you make this thing – how do you
digitize more of the bank. And we have encouraged, pushed, had adoptions and over a three or five or seven-
year period we thought we could really make some good games there. Well, I think this is going to accelerate it
significantly.
So, just data points, but March of this year we did 90% more in digital deposits than we did March of last year.
That was a 200% increase. And so we're seeing how we can run this company in a very different way and have
adoption of these digital products is going to accelerate. So I think that all the things we thought would happen.
There'd be a downturn. That there would be digital adoption. I just think all those things are going to happen, but
just at a much faster pace and it creates some opportunities for us on that path.

Hey, Kevin.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I just had a quick follow-up question. I believe it was John that mentioned earlier about the origination fee coming
through whether that's in third quarter or some a little later and that that pays a lot of bills. And so just in that line
of thinking, should we not be viewing that as necessarily flow into the bottom line, that some of that can be used
for incremental expenses that you'll have, whether that'd be compensating some of your frontline employees,
whether it'd be additional reserve building like you referred to? Just how we should be looking at that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Pollok A
Chief Financial Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. This is John Pollock. To be clear, so that $20 million – a little over $20 million pays really for all the
expense with it, the only caveat, as you know, the rules continue to change. And so, what we have to establish a
loan loss reserves. So, I think our view today is 70% of that field come through the next couple of quarters, and
then 30% or so would come back over the next year to year and a half as the loans repaid. But clearly, it's net of
the operating expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yes. And, Kevin, this is Steve. Well, same as you, we would have as far as how that gets forgiven over time at
least what we know today, this interstate number depending on funding could be in the mid-30s after expenses,
but that's going to happen, as John mentioned, over time, so, hard to really predict it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
And I'll just add on. This is Will. You asked about provision obviously, the level of provision expenses uncorrelated
without it. I mean it certainly provides another source of revenue that could help fund any necessary provision
expense, but those would be independent decisions from one another of course.

proactively reaching out to customers in some of those at-risk industries. But for larger credits that come to you

Chief Credit Officer, South State Corp.
No. Same here. We're just kind of relationship banking, we're having a one-on-one conversation with these
borrowers and we're working with them to understand their capital needs, their prospects for the industry. And
we're just working with it really on a case-by-case basis.

All right. Thank you again for calling in this morning. This is certainly unique times that we're living through. We

we hope to talk to many of you then. Have a great day.
