and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings, including
those found on Form 8-K, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to all the participants on the call. This morning, I will update you on Valley's
strong performance and offer my perspective on recent success and opportunities. Mike will provide additional
details on the financial results before we open the call to your questions.
In the third quarter of 2020, we reported net income of $102 million and earnings per share of $0.25. Exclusive of
a modest charge associated with debt repayment, adjusted earnings were $104 million, representing the highest
level of quarterly earnings in Valley's entire history. These are extraordinary results against the backdrop of a
global health pandemic, a near zero interest rate environment, and general economic uncertainty. We've achieved
these results by building a diverse and strong balance sheet, and developing a corporate culture focused on
customer service and responsiveness.
On an adjusted basis, our pre-provision net revenue increased 2% from the second quarter. This growth reflected
strong fee income and continued interest expense reductions which offset asset yield pressures. This quarter's
adjusted pre-provision net revenue as a percentage of average assets was 1.71%, up from 1.68% in the prior
quarter and 1.46% in the third quarter of 2019. [ph] Net (00:03:11) interest margin pressure across the banking
industry has weighed on profitability, our ability to preserve our net interest margin and drive higher profitability is
exceptionally unique.
We have also benefited from a focus on positive operating leverage. Our adjusted efficiency ratio declined to
46.6% from 53.5% in the third quarter of 2019. This improvement was achieved through 27% year-over-year
revenue growth, which exceeded our adjusted expense growth by over 2.5 times.
While our financial performance has improved significantly, the backdrop remains challenging and future
operating leverage will be dependent on our ability to identify and execute on incremental cost savings and
revenue opportunities. In addition to strong financial results, we are pleased to report a significant reduction in our
active loan deferrals. As of September 30, we had less than $1.1 billion of loans on active deferral representing
3.3% of our total loan portfolio. This compares to an active deferral level of 8% in July and 12% in May.
There has been significant focus on the Metro New York City economy in recent quarters. We remain confident in
our conservative lending philosophy and the strength of our borrower base. In a few minutes, Mike will walk you
through our exposure to this market and the strong underwriting metrics that support our conviction. Our credit
metrics beyond deferrals improved during the quarter as well. While our $31 million provision was approximately
25% lower than the second quarter, our reserve coverage ratio continues to grow.
Our recent earnings momentum has positively demonstrated our ability to generate organic capital. Despite a
significant reserve build and cash dividend, we have grown tangible book value by 8% in the last 12 months. Our
tangible common equity ratio has increased to 7.3% from 6.7% a year ago. We acknowledge that the operating
environment remains challenging and the economic outlook is uncertain. In 2020, we have harvested low-hanging
fruit on the funding side of the balance sheet. We will explore additional opportunities to reduce funding costs and
offset continued asset yield pressure.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Our fee income results and the swap of mortgage banking businesses have been extremely strong this year but
may normalize going forward. Expense controls remain a key focus and we will need to work harder to identify
cost reduction opportunities, in some cases, by leveraging new technologies and solutions. On the credit side, we
continue to believe that our conservative underwriting philosophy positions us to outperform in periods of
economic stress.
In summary, we are extremely proud of our recent financial results. That said, we know that we will need to work
harder than ever to maintain this high performance. I am confident that our team is up to the task. Now, I'd like to
turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some of the quarter's additional financial highlights.

Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 5, you can see that Valley's reported net interest margin increased to 3.01% from
3% in the second quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities improved by 16
basis points to 0.8% and our interest expense declined by approximately 18%. At the same time, our earning
asset yields declined 12 basis points to 3.58%. On the asset side, we have reduced the impact of broader yield
pressures with mix shifts towards loans and away from lower-yielding cash and securities.
Our ability to generate funding cost reductions in both our deposit and the wholesale portfolios has enabled us to
absorb asset yield pressures to this point. While the significant amount of our repricing opportunity has been
captured, slide 6 identifies the amount of retail CDs expected to mature in the next 12 months at rates well above
current offering rates. Specifically, over the next three quarters, we have nearly $4.5 billion of retail maturing CDs
at an average cost of 1%.
Towards the end of the quarter, we paid off $50 million of wholesale funding that carried a 3.7% cost and was set
to mature in 2022. Going forward, we may utilize a portion of our remaining liquidity to redeem other high-cost
liabilities. As a result of our repricing and liquidity deployment levers, we continue to believe that we will
outperform peers from a net interest margin perspective going forward.
The bottom left chart of slide 7 illustrates the significant downward trend in our interest-bearing deposit costs
since the third quarter of 2019. In this time, our CD and interest-bearing non-maturity deposits have declined by
137 basis points and 94 basis points, respectively. We believe there is additional room to reduce interest-bearing
non-maturity deposit costs in addition to the CD repricing benefit that we identified on the prior slide.
From a balance perspective, total deposits declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the ongoing utilization of
PPP funds. Excluding the runoff of over $400 million of PPP-related deposits during the quarter, sequential
deposit growth was approximately 1%. Non-interest bearing deposit generation remained strong, with balances
increasing approximately 2.5% exclusive of PPP. In recent quarters, we have discussed the ongoing customer
rotation from CDs into lower cost transaction accounts. This trend continued in the quarter, with interest-bearing
transaction balances increasing 6% to more than offset a 9% decline in CD balances.
Earlier this year, we bolstered our liquidity position to prepare for the uncertainty of the current environment. On
June 30, 2020, we held nearly $2 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet. As our understanding of
the pandemic has evolved and the economic impacts come into focus, we began to utilize some of this liquidity.
By September 30, our cash position had declined to approximately $1 billion. As mentioned, we may utilize some
of our remaining liquidity to pay off wholesale liabilities.

Slide 8 details our loan portfolio and the asset yield pressure that we are experiencing along with other banks in
the industry. During the quarter, loan yields declined 13 basis points. However, on a positive note, as you can see
in the chart, new origination yields were effectively unchanged at at 3.26%. Loan origination volume also
increased 9% from the second quarter and spreads on new originations expanded 28 basis points. Our new loan
spreads are currently at their widest level since the second quarter of 2019. Total loans of $32.4 billion included
roughly $2.3 billion of outstanding PPP loans at the end of the quarter. Exclusive of PPP, our loan portfolio has
increased approximately 2% on an annualized basis since the end of 2019. We continue to see consistent activity
in our core commercial real estate segments. This quarter saw a rebound in consumer lending activity, which
helped to stabilize the balances in those portfolios as well.
Slide 9 provides additional insight into our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well-diversified in terms of
both collateral and geography. Over the last few quarters, there has been an increased external focus on Metro
New York, and Manhattan specifically. As you can see, only 5% of our CRE portfolio is tied to non-multifamily
properties in Manhattan. The bottom table illustrates key underwriting metrics for the portfolio by geography. I
would highlight our low weighted average LTV of 56% for the portfolio and 50% for non-coop properties in
Manhattan. We remain confident in our underwriting and believe we are well-positioned to navigate the current
environment from a credit perspective.
Moving to slide 10, our non-interest income increased 10% from the linked quarter, driven primarily by strength in
loan sale gains and swap revenue. Fee income ticked up to 14.8% of total revenue from 13.7% in the prior
quarter. We remain focused on growing diverse revenue streams over time and enhancing customer adoption of
the various financial products that we offer. Swap fees were over $19 million during the quarter as we originated
back-to-back swaps on over $550 million of notional loans. Our borrowers continue to demand the interest rate
protection provided by our swap offerings. Net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased approximately
60% sequentially, reflecting both higher loan sale volumes and gain on sale margin expansion. Residential loans
sold exceeded $300 million for the period, up from $240 million in the linked quarter while the gain on sale margin
increased over 50 basis points to 3.79%.
Slide 11 provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the continued improvement in our
adjusted efficiency ratio. Our expenses on both the reported and adjusted basis increased modestly from the prior
quarter. Adjusted expenses exclusive of de minimis merger charges, a $2.4 million charge for debt
extinguishment, and a $3 million for tax amortization, totaled $155 million. This was up $1.6 million or
approximately 1% from the prior quarter. Expenses associated with COVID-19 declined to $1.2 million from above
$2 million in each of the prior two quarters. The ongoing expense is related to enhanced cleaning and sanitation
efforts which are likely to persist for the duration of the pandemic.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio continued to improve coming in at 46.6% versus 46.8% in the second quarter. As Ira
mentioned on a year-over-year basis, we have generated 27% revenue growth, with only an 11% increase in
adjusted operating expenses. We remain focused on expense control, and more specifically positive operating
leverage as revenue pressures continue to build across the industry.
On slide 12, we provide an overview of the evolution of our branch count. We recognize that many banks have
announced reactive branch closures to combat revenue headwinds. At Valley, we consistently evaluate our
branch network to ensure that we are best positioned to efficiently meet our client's needs. This proactive
approach has resulted in a significant improvement in our average branch size and efficiency since 2015. We
anticipate closing an additional 10 branches over the next few months, and we'll continue to evaluate additional
opportunities to streamline our delivery channels.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Turning to slide 13, and asset quality. Our allowance for credit losses increased approximately $15 million to
1.03% of loans from 0.99% in the second quarter. Our allowance represents 1.11% of non-PPP loans, and has
more than doubled from the end of 2019. The quarter's reserve build reflects a $31 million provision and nearly
$15 million of net charge-offs, in line with the prior quarter. Charge-offs in the quarter included approximately $6
million for the taxi medallion portfolio, as valuations continued to decline. There was an additional $6 million
charge-off for a C&I loan that has experienced trouble prior to the onset of COVID-19. This loan was fully
reserved as of June 30.
On the bottom left, you can see the build-up of our allowance as compared to the prior quarter. The net increase
in the allowance is primarily the result of management's qualitative assessment of ongoing risks associated with
COVID. While the Moody's economic forecast to support our CECL model have improved since the summer, it
became clear at the end of the third quarter that the Moody's baseline scenario did not fully account for the
increased likelihood that a federal stimulus bill would not be passed in the near-term. In response, we
conservatively shifted our model weightings away from the baseline and more towards Moody's adverse and
prolonged recession scenarios. This shift resulted in a more adverse economic outlook and higher provision.
Our model now reflects modest GDP declines to the first half of 2021. Despite the reweighting, our unemployment
projections are slightly more optimistic than in the second quarter as a result of an improved outlook in each of the
Moody's scenarios that we utilize. We continue to believe that future provisioning activity will be largely dependent
on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations. Non-accrual loans declined nearly $20 million or
9% in the quarter driven, primarily by a reduction in the C&I segment. As a percentage of total loans, non-accruals
declined to 0.59% from 0.65% in the second quarter. We also saw a significant improvement in our accruing past
due loans which represented 0.26% of loans in the third quarter as compared to 0.29% in the second quarter.
Slide 14 illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the ongoing improvement in our capital
ratios. Tangible book value has increased 8% in the last 12 months, driven by our increased earnings power. Our
tangible common equity ratio increased to 7.3% from 6.98% in the second quarter. This reflects our strong
earnings and the utilization of some excess liquidity during the quarter. We estimate that a $2.3 billion of PPP
loans reduced our TCE to total asset ratio by approximately 45 basis points in the quarter. On a year-over-year
basis, we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory capital ratios. We remain confident in our
capital levels and believe that the consistent growth in our risk-based ratios illustrate our improving ability to
increase our capital levels on an organic basis.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some closing comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. I'm extremely proud of Valley's results for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our flexible and
diverse balance sheet has enabled us to preserve our net interest margin in the face of a challenging interest rate
environment. Our positive operating leverage and the dramatic improvement in our efficiency ratio is a testament
to the innovative and responsive culture embodied by our team. We remain confident in our credit underwriting
and the strength of our loan portfolio. We look forward to continued success for the remainder of the year and into
2021.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Frank Schiraldi of Piper Sandler. Your line is
now open.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Good morning.

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Well, it seems like you're certainly ahead of peers in terms of cost initiatives. I mean you guys talked a little bit
about branch consolidation, and Mike you mentioned, and Ira you mentioned as well positive operating leverage.
Just wondering your thoughts going forward how confident you are in being able to deliver a positive operating
leverage, given the tough revenue environment. And if you think you can keep, for example, efficiency ratio below
50% in the future here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks. Thanks for the question, Frank. I think at Valley, it's definitely become the culture as to how we think
about expenses throughout the entire organization. And it's a way forward for us as to how we think about
innovating and the use of technology. We've been very proactive as to how we think about that overall expense
base. Here we didn't need COVID to tell us that the expense model needed to change that it was really – changes
based on customer behavior as well as the opportunities presented from technology. So, we think we're definitely
ahead of where our peers are and have a good path forward as to how we're looking at the expense base.
Mike, is there something you want to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. The only thing I would say is, don't lose sight of the fact on the opportunities that we still have to re-price
our term funding costs as well that's shown on page 6 of our investor presentation under our 12-month forward
maturity schedule. And relative to the industry, we believe that this advantage for us and the results in managing
our operating leverage to 2.5x has demonstrated that we've taken full advantage of that as we've tried to defend
the NIM in this challenging environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
And then, just one follow-up, if I could, on capital. Just wondering, if – you guys mentioned, given liquidity on the
balance sheet, you do have the potential for additional pay-off on the wholesale side. I'd imagine it's not

necessarily significant to capital levels. Anything you might do further there. But just wondering, how your
thoughts on capital levels have maybe evolved and where you think, at this point – what is the right sort of TCE
ratio for Valley to operate at in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think you know we had previously given guidance I think around 7.25% [ph] was an (00:21:41) appropriate
TCE to a TA number for us. I think as we think about capital, it's really about the optionality and the flexibility that
we have moving forward, I think there's a lot of strategic initiatives within the organization that we have. And
having the appropriate capital levels to support those initiatives is really where the focus is at this point. So, as
opposed to being pinned down and telling you it's 7.50%, 7.60% or whatever that specific number may be, I think
as we think about capital it's really that optionality. There is so many opportunities in this organization today and
having the appropriate capital levels for that is really where we're focused.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Just to add that the focus on growing organic capital is very strong. It's just as cultural in our company as our
desire for operating leverage as well and improvements in expenses. As an evidence of that when you look at our
TCE levels and you take into account what PPP has done to that which we estimate at 45 basis points, combined
with where we're at on CET1 today, both of those are the highest in the last 40 quarters. So, we've clearly turned
the corner and made some significant progress.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Sure. Okay. But it doesn't sound like a real change to guide, Ira, in terms of – you mentioned in the past 7.25%, I
mean there's no change to thinking that, that number has changed significantly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I don't think giving a guide right now is appropriate for us. I think maybe we'll consider as we move forward, but I
think just highlighting Mike's point, on an absolute basis look where we are today versus where we were four, five,
six, seven years ago. It's an unbelievable basis to where we are. And you layer on top of that the fact that we
have a PPNR of 1.71% today on an adjusted basis, the amount of organic capital that we're originating today is
tremendous. So, once again, I think it just goes back to the tremendous amount of opportunities we have within
the organization supported by the organic growth that we're doing which is something Valley hasn't historically
had.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.

Hi, Alex.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
My first question is on loan growth, you had loan growth in commercial real estate this quarter and you mentioned
in the release controlled growth. Can you explain what do you mean by this and what do you look at to qualify for
this and also how is the pipeline looking into the fourth quarter for commercial real estate? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Alex. This is Tom Iadanza. By controlled growth what we mean is that we do a lot of business with
existing customers, people have been through various economic cycles. Historically it's been 60% existing
customers 40% new, and it's probably increased to 70/30 since the pandemic increased. Our focus is on
relationship-driven business, very diversified, we're very granular, our average real estate loan is still under $4
million, our average C&I loan is still under $1 million. We're diverse by markets. We're not heavy in Manhattan.
We're heavier in the suburbs, and we'll continue to focus on that relationship-driven business. Our conservative
underwriting standards will be maintained through all of this. We will not stretch to grow. Our pipelines pre-
pandemic probably we're in the $2 billion range [ph] likely, they're down 50% (00:25:21) from that level now. We
believe we'll grow modestly but stay at that $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion level going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. And then a question on NIM, outside of your time deposits, you have savings deposits at 36 basis
points. And then in the last zero interest rate environment, you were in the low 30s. Do you think you can go
below this 30 basis point range this time around?

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
You know I won't give guidance on a specific number, but I would say this, that the processes that we have set up
to benchmark ourselves against the market and then react quickly are probably the strongest they've ever been in
the company's history. So I feel fairly confident that if the market will allow for that, we're poised and can quickly

Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Mike, just along the lines of margin, you've given some great disclosures there. And obviously you've made a
significant headway on the funding side. But I think – and you pointed this out – one of the interesting points was
that the loan origination yields seem to be flat from 2Q. Can you just talk a little bit about that, or maybe Tom, if
you weigh in on that as well? Sort of, do you think this loan yields have kind of bottomed and spreads are
widening a bit? I know you referenced that – your new spreads are up over a year ago, but just kind of some color
around kind of loan pricing. And if you've perhaps seen a bottom in where loan yields are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It's hard to predict if we've seen a bottom, but we have implemented floors in all of our loans, and that has helped
on those spreads. We'll continue to do that. It's also responsiveness. [ph] That our customers (00:27:30) at 70%,
they use us all the time. They come to us because we can get it done and they recognize the value in today's
market of paying for that performance. So we'll continue to have floors.
We'll continue to aggressively bring in deposits to fund this. And the good news is the spreads are going up and
the quality of the loans and the level of leverage is going down. So we're kind of seeing it on both the quality and
return front. We think it will continue but it's hard to predict. It's still competitive for high quality loans, still have a
lot of competition today.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just on your hotel and hospitality deferrals, it kind of ticked up a little bit. Is that primarily around the New York
area and just do you have any latest occupancy statistics on that versus the year ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, to put it in context the hotel portfolio in total is about $500 million and 15%, $75 million is on deferral. The
uptick is coming mostly out of Florida which we have primary portfolio of hotels in. We don't really have much New
York, New Jersey so we're not seeing the same experience there.
I do want to point out that going into the pandemic, the loan-to-values on these portfolios were less than 60%. It's
all real estate secured. We have [ph] PGs (00:29:18) on all. The increase in this particular quarter was to a
specific borrower who is highly liquid, has the wherewithal to sustain this, and also has revenue and resources
that are not tied to the hotel business.
And the same experience on restaurant, though that's a little bit more spread out, New York, New Jersey and
Florida, but we've seen a significant decline. And those deferrals were down to about $60 million in total and loan-
to-value going into the pandemic was 60% on that portfolio. It's all real estate secured and we have [ph] PGs
(00:29:57). We don't expect it to get any worse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Appreciate the color on that. And then just going back on the margin, maybe Mike, you can handle this
one, your short-term and long-term borrowings tipped a little higher this quarter. What was – what's the driver
behind that? Was it just lower cost borrowings rolling off? And then should we expect this to go a little higher in
the fourth quarter with the $1.2 billion rolling off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. So, the short-term borrowings are exactly as you said, that's the maturities there. The long-term side is the
impact of having the sub debt issuance for an entire quarter, so I think that's probably fairly self-explanatory. What
I would say on the remaining funding side, the non-debt-related funding side, if you go to page 6 [ph] and the IP
(00:30:57) and you look at those rates, especially in the first, second and third quarter of 2021, as of this morning,
FHLB advance rates as a proxy range between 39 basis points and 45 basis points. So, you can see there's still a
lot of leverage for us to reprice.

And on the maturing CD book which is, FHLB is not a good proxy, we know with offering rates today there's two
things going on there, one, people are seeking greater liquidity so as their CDs mature they will transition into a
transaction account, so we have seen that, it's increased our deposits overall; and second, the availability for
longer-term CD rates, even if you put them out there, customers are not going to take that given the absolute
levels of rates and so when they do re-sign up for a new CD, it's at a much lower rate. And our retention there has
been very strong as well.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Appreciate. Thank you, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Breese of Stephens, [ph] Incorporated
(00:32:03). Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, I was hoping – could you quantify total PPP income for the quarter? And then, Mike, I know you characterize
the margin outlook in terms of, you think you will outperform peers, but I guess I – perhaps that's open to
interpretation. Could you maybe characterize the margin outlook in terms of whether you think it can remain
stable or expand from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Matt, I'll – this is Tom, I'll handle the income for the quarter and then Mike will talk about the margin again.
The third quarter income from PPP was about $14.8 million. $5.7 million of that is from interest, $9.1 million is
from fees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And I think if I understand your question on NIM, it was related to my prepared remarks around the relative
advantage that we have to peers. So I think it's like motherhood and apple pie to say that there's NIM
compression in the market. I mean, that's absolutely going on. The things that are encouraging to us that we've
already visited about are the fact that our new loan originations have seemingly flattened out with second quarter.

Yet to be determined whether that continues, but as Tom mentioned, having fours on our loans and having
greater discipline in this environment seems to be an advantage.
And then I would just couple that again with the funding side, as I mentioned earlier, we still have opportunities
here. And you can see both the dollars and the rates on the [ph] IP (00:33:37) on page 6. Okay. And then I would
lastly say in – especially on new originations, the spread on new originations on the lending side are at 20 basis
points higher. So, we've seen a better loan and a better spread in this market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And then in terms of expenses, you have 10 branches being cut in the fourth quarter. I was hoping
for – maybe if you could quantify what the expenses tied to that are? And then, just thinking about the longer-term
expense outlook, do you feel like this kind of $155 million range is appropriate for this environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So, on the 10 branches that we announced that we would close and we've achieved regulatory approval,
correct? Regulatory approval?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes, correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
We estimate the full-year 2021 cost savings to be between $3 million and $4 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow-up question from Collyn Gilbert of KBW.
Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Okay. Just a follow-up on the expense question and getting a little bit more granular on it, just curious
how specifically the professional fee line is going to trend and will that kind of stay elevated as you guys are
looking at some of these technology investments and technology initiatives, or does that come down? And then I
just – also to – on that line, just curious about your outlook for mortgage banking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I'll take maybe a little different tack on it, I will address the specific question on professional fees but let me
kind of give you a little more color. It is somewhat in the earnings release as well related to expenses. So, the
adjusted expenses in the third quarter were $155 million, and as we said earlier, that's a 1% increase against 2Q
2020. But there's a couple of things in there that you need to consider.
First, there's $5.1 million increase in compensation and benefit-related expenses, but we think that that's mostly
due to medical and employer 401(k) expenses because we're a self-funded plan, and I think at this juncture in the

pandemic we're starting to see some of our employee base and our covered individuals under our plan get
medical treatment for things that were delayed early in the pandemic and they're going back to their doctor. So, I
think that's first and foremost.
There was also a decline in our compensation-related deferred loan costs due to just absolute lower loan
volumes. That's just how it works. And then there was a modest incentive accrual as well, increase. As it relates
to professional fees, as we've talked about our core system improvements around here and all the things we're
doing in technology, it stands to reason over time those costs will increase.
And we do have a lot of consulting-related expense right now that's not capitalized just because of where we're at
in the life cycle of those projects. So, they get – more of that expense gets expensed upfront, and then once you
get past that, you'll see more of that going into being capitalized.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Collyn, just to follow-up on Mike's point, I think the real focus here is on the operating leverage, and I think
maintaining an expense base that supports the growth of the organization and where we are is really important
today. But the focus is on making sure that we're generating positive operating leverage and I think the 2.5 times
that we did this period reflects where we think we're going to be able to continue that path as – really, as we [ph]
guide (00:37:27) forward.
On the mortgage banking, I think obviously it's a function of where interest rates are today. I think Tom alluded to
earlier that pipelines remain really strong and we think there's going to be significant growth there, but it really
reflects the diverse business model that we've created here and it's something that we think as long as interest
rates remain favorable, that we'll be able to benefit from.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
