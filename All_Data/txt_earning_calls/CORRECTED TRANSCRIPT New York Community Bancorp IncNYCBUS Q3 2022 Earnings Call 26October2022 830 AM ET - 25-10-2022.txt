New York Community nor Flagstar is going to comment on or address any questions regarding a pending merger
on today's conference call.
With that being said, let's turn now to our third quarter results. Overall, the company had a solid third quarter.
Despite aggressive Fed tightening and an inverted yield curve, still, we produced solid loan and deposit growth,
lower operating expenses and continued strong levels of asset quality, which remains our hallmark. In terms of
the net interest margin, given our liability-sensitive balance sheet not surprisingly, we witnessed margin
compression during the quarter. However, we still reported diluted earnings per share of $0.31 excluding merger-
related expenses. This was unchanged compared to the third quarter of last year and in line with consensus.
Turning now to the main drivers of our quarterly performance, after three consecutive quarters of double-digit loan
growth, loan growth moderated as expected. Total loans held for investment rose nearly $450 million during the
quarter to $49 billion compared to the previous quarter. Year-to-date, total loans held for investments are now up
$3.2 billion or at 9% annualized.
Loan growth continues to be centered on the multi-family specialty finance portfolios. At September 30, the multi-
family portfolio totaled $37.2 billion, representing strong growth both on a year-to-date and a linked-quarter basis.
Multi-family loans increased $407 million sequentially and $2.6 billion or 10% annualized since the beginning of
this year. We continued to take market share in the multi-family space. The recent survey by S&P Global Market
Intelligence ranked NYCB as the second largest multi-family portfolio lender nationally. And we believe we are by
far the largest multi-family portfolio lender in our non-luxury rent-regulated lending niche in the New York City
market.
Specialty finance loans also continued to increase up $117 million to $4.3 billion compared to the previous
quarter, and up $755 million or 29% annualized so far in 2022. As of the third quarter, specialty finance had total
commitments of $7.3 billion, up 11% compared to $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. Of the current third
quarter amount, 78% or approximately $5.7 billion are structured as floating rate obligations tied to either prime or
SOFR, which have and will continue to benefit the company in a rising interest rate environment.
I would also point out that as of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $7.4 billion of multi-family and
CRE loans which come up onto their contractual maturity or option repricing date over the next two years. This
includes multi-family loans of and an average weighted average coupon of 3.74%, $5.7 billion and $1.7 billion of
CRE loans with an average weighted average coupon of 3.52%. Going forward, our loan yield should benefit from
low coupon loans repricing to higher current market rates.
In terms of this pipeline, as we head into the fourth quarter, it stands at a robust $2.3 billion compared to $2.5
billion in the previous quarter. Of this amount 87% represents new money to the bank. On a liability front, we also
grew our deposits during the quarter. Despite higher interest rates, which led to outflows in certain categories,
total deposits increased $461 million compared to the previous quarter and that increased $6.6 billion or 25%
annualized so far during 2022 to nearly $42 billion.
As you've heard me discuss many times over the past 18 months, the focus is on and will continue to be on
deposit gathering. Last year, we re-emphasize bringing in more deposits from our borrowings, and we also
launched our banking-as-a-service initiative. We are pleased with the success we have gotten with those two
programs and expect they will continue to be the primary drivers of our deposit growth going forward. On a year-
to-date basis, loan-related deposits were up just under $800 million, at 26% annualized. Since we started
refocusing on its deposit channel during the first quarter of 2021, total loan-related deposits have increased $1.3
billion, or about 37%. Additionally, business operating accounts of 32% of total loan-related deposits.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Banking-as-a-Service deposits totaled $7.9 billion at third quarter 2022. Our BaaS deposits fall generally into
three key verticals, traditional BaaS, which totals $5.3 billion in deposits, mortgage-as-a-service which caters to
mortgage, banking and servicing companies totaling $2 billion and government banking-as-a-service which cater
states and municipalities as well as the U.S. treasuries, pre-loaded debit card program, totaling $579 million.
Mortgage-as-a-service and government-as-a-service are two verticals expected to drive card growth within the
overall banking-as-a-service segment. Recently, the company won two new BaaS mandates. Both of these
should result in fee income and deposit growth opportunities for the company.
Moving on to one of the company's hallmarks, credit, our asset quality and credit trends remain superb, and
continue to rank the company as among the best in the industry. Non-performing assets totaled $50 million, down
$6 million compared to $56 million in the prior quarter and were 8 basis points of total assets. Additionally, we
recorded zero net charge-offs during the current third quarter compared to $7 million of net recoveries last
quarter. The strong asset quality measures reflect our conservative underwriting practices and historically low
level of losses in our core portfolios.
Before moving on to the next topic, I'd like to provide a brief update on a New York City real estate environment.
New York City residential real estate remains healthy and commercial real estate continues to gradually improve.
Monthly median rents for Manhattan multi-family apartments jumped 21% year-over-year to about $4,000 to the
third highest on record. Median rents appear to have stabilized at record high levels as well.
Turning now to the commercial side, average retail asking rents in Manhattan recorded a quarterly uptick, rising
for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2016. Manhattan third quarter 2022 office leasing surged to a post-
pandemic high. This was driven by several large relocations and the continuing flight-to-quality trend, particularly
in midtown. Also, the Manhattan availability rate decreased to 18.4% with positive absorption for the first time in
12 quarters.
New York City office occupancy increased in September likely due to many large companies urging their
employees to return to office. Similarly, there was a significant increase in MTA ridership, seated diners in New
York City, evidence in continuing strength in New York City economic activity. Each of these drivers are evidence
of continuing strength in the New York City economy.
Moving on now to the income statement, third quarter net interest income totaled $326 million, up $8 million or 3%
on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact from prepayment penalty income, net interest income on a non-
GAAP basis increased $14 million or 5% to $316 million on a year-over-year basis. In terms of the net interest
margin, excluding the impact from prepayments, third quarter NIM declined 23 basis points on a linked-quarter
basis to 2.15%. This was due to a higher cost of funds given aggressive Fed policy tightening.
On the expense front, our non-interest expense remained in check despite continuing to make investments. Non-
interest expense totaled $136 million during the third quarter, which includes $4 million of merger-related
expenses. Excluding this item, operating expenses were $132 million, down $2 million compared to the previous
quarter and up 2% on a year-over-year basis.
At yesterday's meeting, the board of directors declared a $0.17 dividend on common shares. The dividend will be
paid on November 17 to common shareholders of record as of November 7. Based on yesterday's closing stock
price, this translates into an annualized dividend yield of 7.6%.

With that, we would be happy to answer any questions you may have. We will do our very best to get all of you
within the time remaining, but if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or the week or during the week.
Operator, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Morning. I guess the first maybe let's start with the margin outlook in terms of what you expect to happen in the
fourth quarter. And give us some color around if you could, your views around, one, where you see the margin
[ph] troughing (10:28) if you assume the forward curve plays out as is over the next few quarters and then
anything in terms of the BaaS deposits that helps you mitigate that margin pressure. So, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sorry, Ebrahim. I'm going to pass on the question on the margin to our CFO, Mr. Pinto. John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. On the margin front, when we look at the fourth quarter, what we expect and we'll talk about it in really two
different ways, right? If we assume the Flagstar deal would have closed on October 1, we'll look at what the
impact of that transaction would be. So, when you look at where we start from the third quarter, ex-prepay, at
2.15%, we would be up 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. That's our forecast with Flagstar closing on October
1.
Exclusive of Flagstar, we expect the margin, ex-prepay, to be around 1.95%. So, down 20 basis points on a
standalone basis, slightly better than what we did in the third quarter. So, the impact of Flagstar for the fourth
quarter, we're looking at a 60 basis point benefit when you look at margin ex-prepay.
The BaaS deposits, we talk about the BaaS deposits – as we talked about them in the last couple of calls, they
are primarily floating rate, right, and they have high betas, especially the mortgage-as-a-service deposits. Their
beta is very close to 100%. The other deposits are a little less than that, when you look at some of the other
Banking-as-a-Service deposits that we've brought in. So, we're monitoring that. The goal is, of course, to bringing
other operating accounts tied to those and continue to build out those relationships and also to build out the
government as a deposit relationship. That's where the benefit hopefully we're going to see when those deposits
start to come in because those are non-interest bearing deposits.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Hey, Ebrahim, it's Tom. I just add that that has started, we've – we were awarded a very significant government-
as-a-service contract, which kicked in at the end of October. That is certainly significant, as we go into the period
ahead. In addition to that, we have a number of wins on the government side that's possibly kick in, in addition to
that in 2023. So we're excited about the impact of that because that is all zero-cost deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And John, just going back to your 1.95% margin outlook ex prepay. Do you expect the cost of deposit increase
that we saw this quarter to accelerate next quarter or because of some of these deposit dynamics, we expect that
to be a little more tempered versus the third quarter increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. I mean, we saw that the third quarter was difficult from a deposit beta perspective. No doubt. We expect with
these government deposits to come in that that will get a little bit better or hopefully stabilize at those – at that
third quarter level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just one question I appreciate on what you mentioned about the deal up front, but clearly, you
still think it's – you still expect to close the deal based on what John said, and what you have in your slide deck.
Given the change in the macro, has anything changed from your perspective, and I'm not sure if anyone from
Flagstar's on the line that would make you think differently about the strategic merits of the deal today or
November 1 versus when the deal was announced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Let me be clear, in my opening comments, relatively clear, we're not going to speak specifically about the pending
merger. However, as far as going back to our discussion of the transaction itself, we're very comfortable that the
business combination is powerful opportunity for two companies to come together and build a NewCo that has
good diversity, a tremendous unique opportunity on deposit side on funding and give us an opportunity to
transition to commercial banking enterprise. We're excited about that. I'm not going to be specific about the
transaction itself, but clearly when we came out with this partnership, and I know, Sandro and Lee are on the line
that we were very, very positive about the concept of putting these balance sheets together.

I know it did reference, if you want [indiscernible] (14:30) Sandro and Lee are on the line. But Sandro by all
means, feel free to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, sure. Thanks, Tom. And thanks for the question, Ebrahim. Look, if this was Flagstar as earnings call, I would
start out by telling you that it's the best quarter we've ever had. Not the most profitable quarter, but the best
quarter. Because if you look at our margin, nine years ago, it was under 2%, and virtually all of our income came
from mortgage. Our margin now is over 4% with the far majority of it coming from banking.
We've got a high-quality loan portfolio, we've got efficient funding. And while much smaller due to market
conditions, we're still profitable in our mortgage business, where many originators are not. And that mortgage
business will be there to take full advantage of the next refinancing market which will come. We don't know when,
but it will come. And on top of all that, we have a very formidable servicing business. And when you look at our
expenses, we've been able to manage them to revenues. Our efficiency ratios have declined pretty significantly.
So if given the opportunity, getting back to your question, combining this company with NYCB, taking what they
do well, running the similar playbook that we've run, as we've rebuilt Flagstar, I'm excited about our ability to
produce something very, very special going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just one, Sandro, since you mentioned it was one of the best quarters of Flagstar. Pardon my lack of
familiarity, but it sounds like your outlook for margin is relatively flat next quarter versus this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Is that implying that again speak to the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Well, Ebrahim, what we – how we try to structure our balance sheet viewing ourselves as an independent
organization is we feel very comfortable with a 4% margin with our business model. So, given what we believe we
can get out of mortgage, in this environment, what we believe we can get out of servicing, in this environment,
and the servicing piece of it is pretty certain, and 4% margin on top of a clean loan book, I think the bottom line
number feels really good.
So, at this point, I think the challenge is managing the betas on the deposit side in a way that doesn't compromise
the margin going forward because there's going to be margin pressure. And there's no question about it. But I
think that we're very comfortable at Flagstar that we can hang in there in that 4% range going forward. So that's

my outlook. I mean, we only give you outlook for the next quarter, but, we're confident about that, at least for the
next quarter. And, I think overall, as I said, given our business model, that that's a margin that works very well for
us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Yes, it's good. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Bernard von-Gizycki with Deutsche Bank. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So my first question is, so you still had good growth IN multi-family portfolio. But as you noted, it moderated, but it
seems in line with expectations. I'm just wondering, with the rates continuing to rise, is there a level of rates where
that could drive growth to peers, who might be pricing maybe a bit more aggressively like the agencies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's interesting. It's been a very interesting pipeline going into Q4. Q3 is typically a seasonality quarter for us. Q4
pipelines is relatively strong. The coupon is extremely strong given the, I mean, if you look on a year-over-year
comparison basis, we are going for a 3% market to a 6% market overnight, which is powerful towards repricing
this book of business. So, we've anticipated moderate growth in the second half of 2022.
We probably grew a little bit better than we expected as we go into the pipeline, so our overall net loan growth for
the year is still going to come in around 8% to 9.5%. So even if we're at the consistent level of third quarter, which
is unlikely, given fourth quarter activity, typically the, a robust activity in general, coming off of a seasonality
quarter of Q3. So it's been an interesting opportunity here given where the agencies are today, where the shape
of the curve is.
And, I think in general, most portfolio lenders are getting good economics. And I think the opportunity here is
moving that coupon from the low 3s to the market, which is significantly higher than low 3s. So, we're excited
about what's coming due. We've offered some unique options for our customers that are going into the re-pricing
period and we're trying to move our balance sheet to more interest rate risk – to an interest rate risk compatible
towards getting away from liability sensitivity to asset sensitivity and offering SOFR options has been a well-
received option for our customers. And it seems like a high percentage of those customers are opting for a SOFR
option. And we'll then we'll work on moving our balance sheet to more asset sensitivity. I think that sets us very
well to look at this large book of business towards more of a SOFR option in a rising rate environment.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
And as far as the agency is concerned, I think in the long run, as we focus on merger plans, we are going to have
a capital markets tool that will allow us to be more competitive. We're going to be able to offer an option that could
continue on a derivative perspective to do long-term financing and take those fixed rate loans and swap them out
to floating rate. So I think that's going to be another competitive opportunity on the benefits of the merger, so
we're looking forward to the capital markets benefit. And that also comes with some fee income opportunity as
well.
So, we're still very, very bullish about valuations and sponsorships. But we're also cognizant that things have
slowed down because of the substantial interest rate increases that happen in such a short period of time. Going
from 3% in the beginning year to 6% at the market is a big move. So, we should benefit on re-pricing the portfolio,
which could really bode well for future margin benefits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. I appreciate that color. And then, obviously, I understand about the commentary on the pending
deal. But I was just wondering, recently you filed some S-4s and you provided a better snapshot of some of the
assumptions from the time of the deal announcement to 03/31 and 06/30 of this year. I was just wondering, could
you provide us any updates on your tangible book value or earnings accretion estimates or anything you can
comment on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, when we announced the deal on the tangible book value side, we were 3.5% accretive. When we
looked at it and we talked about it in June, that tangible book accretion jumped pretty dramatically. It's almost
probably 8% or 9%. Our estimate now is at 09/30, it has come back down around that 4% level and it's really just
due to the purchase accounting adjustments, given the changes in interest rates. But it's highly dependent on
where those – where interest rates are at the day of closing. So, that's where we look at it. We're still probably
right around that same level, a little better than when we originally anticipated the deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. That 4% you said is as of 09/30?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Right. All right. Great. Thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. For the NIM guidance, what are you guys assuming for those puttable borrowings
rolling into new structures? And then, what are you rolling those into at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, we had a handful of puttable borrowings put back to us in the third quarter. And then, we'll have some that
we're forecasting a large portion of them to get put back, given where rates are today in the fourth quarter. And
we're using – we're hoping to fund it with deposits, of course. But any shortfall on the deposit side will backfill with
FHLB advances. We'll put some swap funding on depending on where those levels are.
The puttable market is still out there. So, we could look at some puttables as we go forward as well. So, it's really
a mix of different liability structures that we'll look to refinance those puttables into as they come back to us. From
an interest rate risk perspective, you're taking off money with under a three-month duration, whatever you put it
on, you're going to gather a little bit interest rate risk benefits in both the third and the fourth quarter by putting that
out a little bit longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, I would just add to that commentary that given the government project that we just started to book recently
in October, that's going to be significant for the quarter. So, it could be, on average, in the billions, between $2
billion to $3 billion on average for the quarter. That would be at a 0% cost of funds. That's the Middle-Class Tax
Refund prepaid [ph] collect (23:01) program that we're involved in. That's a very good piece of business for the
bank and we will be able to leverage that opportunity as we look at the re-pricing mechanism.
And in the big picture, if you think about the balance sheets, certainly on the assumption of coming together with
our potential partnership with Flagstar, we have optionality as we choose how we want to move this balance
sheet forward in the future. And that's going to be a very unique opportunity at the time, as we assume we can put
these balance sheets together. That's a really powerful position to be when it comes to having significant
optionality on funding.
So, this is something we're focusing on a daily basis. It's fourth quarter. And we're excited about the new
government piece of business that's coming on as well as the potential of balance sheet consolidation which will
give us some significant choices as we embark upon a transformational opportunity here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. So, does that – 20 basis points of pressure, does that include the $2 billion to $3 billion in deposits that
you're hoping to get or expecting to get in the fourth quarter?

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then, just going back to the deal accretion, what were you guys saying is your updated
math on the earnings accretion that you're expecting to get from that? I heard you on the tangible book part. I just
I may have missed the earnings accretion piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We haven't given – we haven't really commented on updated guidance on earnings accretion, because it
was really based originally on IBES estimates. And IBES estimates now will have consolidated deals in them. So,
the deal is still accretive. We don't see any need to change that guidance. We're pretty comfortable with what's
out there. So, we haven't specifically updated that from deal announcement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

Yeah. So, if we close the deal on October 1, right now, we're estimating would be slightly asset-sensitive, but
pretty close to neutral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. And then maybe just one last one on expenses, how are you thinking about 4Q or just the year overall and
you got the annual guidance out there. Any updated thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. I mean the annual guidance of $540 million I think will come in a little better. We did a little better this quarter
with managing expenses. I would assume the fourth quarter will be right around that $134 million, $135 million
range. That's kind of where we've been. So, yeah, I think we'll do a little better from a year perspective than we
did from our original estimate at $540 million. But the fourth quarter, I see coming in around that $135 million
level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery
Scott. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, Thanks. Good morning. John and Tom, I want to ask you just about the liquidity figures. From the last
quarterly call report, it seemed that you had a very low level of [ph] cloud (26:10) securities, a lot of potential
collateral. In fact, some of those measures work better now than it would have been pre-pandemic. So
standalone, is anything changed as the end of September? And do you see any, I guess, ability to add more debt
if you wanted to on the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start and I'll pass it on to John. Bottom line is, in the quarter, we looked at heavy liquidity position and put it into
short term U.S. treasuries inside of six months. So that being said, there was an opportunity to take a lower yield
in cash and move it into a we'll call it category, which is almost consistent with cash, which is six month treasury
bills inside of that as a strategic move as we saw rates significantly rise here.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
And, John, if you want to add anything more to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. That, so that's where you'll see the securities portfolio increase for us, which we haven't seen in a very long
time. That is just putting on, as Tom mentioned, U.S. Treasury securities six months or under, just trying to pick
up some yield based on, what we could get at the Fed at the time. Collateral wise, it's just as good as cash
liquidity, just as good, of course, as high quality liquid assets. So that's what that was. We're not looking to put
duration on in that portfolio yet. We'll continue to monitor that. But with the strong loan growth that we've had, we
haven't had a need for that. So that growth in the securities portfolio is really a liquidity, just a liquidity play from
cash to securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. And then just a follow-up question on the banking-as-a-service deposits. As you look beyond a couple
quarters, I know these are high beta for the moment, but is there any issue with retaining those funds or do you
think actually that their retention is going to be high and they'll just they'll behave differently as rates move around
next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I indicated in my prepared remarks that we're going to anticipate, government-as-a-service to ramp up here. It
takes a while to get these contracts nailed down, and put in place, and they are long-term contracts. So we have
a nice book of business, of business going forward. We indicated that we have a very significant ramp-up in Q4. I
think it's about $400 million or $500 million a week in cash drops and it could go up to about $6 billion for one
transaction. That's a significant piece of business.
At the same time, we are the bank provider for U.S. Treasury and as any programs that come out of the Treasury
Department, we are now onboarding that. It's a long-term contract. We're very pleased about our partnership with
First Data and Fiserv. So it's been a very good opportunity for the bank to use that type of funding.
At the same time, we're committed to mortgage-as-a-service. I think there's great opportunity on a planned
merger with Flagstar. And we think there's a great opportunity there to build that. So, that is probably more high
beta because it is tied to SOFR index type funding. But we're committed to that because we're going to be a large
player assuming the transaction closes. And when we come together, that mortgage-as-a-service business could
be very powerful as we work a lot of the corresponding customers.
When it comes to traditional BaaS, we're out there working hard on – working trying to get new business. And it's
been a good journey for us. But I think in general, we're focused on the three verticals. And ultimately, as we look
at digitization as a company, there's a tremendous opportunity to digitize the mortgage space. And that's where I
think great opportunity will come. And even though it's not tied to traditional BaaS, but our team in digital are
focusing on a lot of projects that's going to hopefully lean towards some good deposit growth. We think there's a
tremendous deposit opportunity on mortgage, having the ability to transact loans, service loans and get these
deposit activity, I think that's a tremendous benefit of the planned merger with Flagstar. The mortgage-as-a-
service is going to be a focus as well.

Hi. Good morning. This is [ph] Alex (29:56) on for Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. You mentioned the benefits from the banking-as-a-service business. Do you expect any
investments needed to scale this business and get those new opportunities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we're going to be very mindful of what our requirements are here. So, we've been adding staff. We have built
out the Chief Digital Office directly reporting to the CEO, I think as a priority. This is an interesting opportunity. As
indicated, mortgage, in our opinion, given the history of NYCB and Flagstar, there's a lot of long-term history
there, on how to service the escrow account, the [ph] P&I (30:30) payment. So that is embedded within the
franchise, within our operating people. But we're going to move people around, and we're going to make sure we
have the right support for these lines of businesses.
I will tell you the challenges is onboarding some of the unique opportunities in traditional BaaS, because obviously
it takes time and it's API interfacing within the core and we're working on new opportunities within the core that
can make it a lot more efficient, but we are staffing that area, and moving people around within the organization. I
think that's also its great when you put two big companies together and think about opportunities within the
organization. There are going to be opportunities in the organization to shuffle people around to support growth of
different verticals within the company.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
And our vertical here on the funding side is going to transition from wholesale to more of a traditional type funding
mechanism, and part of that will be BaaS. In particular, government-as-a-service has been, it's been a long
trajectory of getting them onto the balance sheet. We had a good run during the pandemic and we were very
successful there. That let us into other opportunities. But we have a bunch of transactions that we've won and we
plan on onboarding. So, I think 2023 could be a nice pickup year on very core stable accounts, although they're
not permanent because they do move on, but we do have the opportunity for an ongoing benefit of good funding
sources as we look at the planned merger, as we look at our choices on balance sheet, and look at this one
vertical as a clearly a different funding mechanism, a traditional non-traditional funding that NYCB is accustomed
to.
Moving from a thrift to a commercial bank, is the strategy, as Sandro indicated. He's been through his journey.
And we hope to do this together. And that's a very powerful change, when you look at funding. So like I said in my
opening remarks, funding, funding, funding we're focused on that, we're razor-focused on that. You see a
significant shift on our ability to bring in deposits, so we're going to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thank you. And you touched on this briefly earlier, but can you talk about the fee opportunities that you're seeing
from this banking-as-a-service business as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say initially it varies just on card fees, it's not significant, but they do add up when you have 5 million to 10
million cards out there, a couple of pennies per card per month it adds up. It's not significant to the total P&L. But
we are seeing some nice fee income opportunities there, and it's consistent. As we onboard more municipalities,
more states throughout the country we'll have more consistency of fee income. So it's another avenue that we're
focusing to justify the investment in the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thanks. And a follow-up to the comment you mentioned about the multi-family and commercial real estate loans
repricing. Can you talk about the market rates for those loans and maybe specialty loans as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, on the specialty side, it's mostly SOFR-plus the spread has been consistent. About 80% of our book is
floating rate. We're doing predominately mostly floating rate structure in the specialty, the real credit buy-up
opportunities at very high, high, high-quality senior secured position. We've been in this business for a while now,
and our team that runs it has done an excellent job. We've never had a late pay. We never had a charge-off. You
never had a delinquency. So, we're really positive of the asset quality of that. But it's been a good growth
business. We have quite a bit of commitment out there. So in the event that markets do have some volatility,
there's a possibility that there'll be some good drawdowns. We'll make some good money on the drawdowns. So,
we think that may happen given the uncertainty of markets in the current environment today.
In respect to the CRE and multi, it's been a very significant increase in total interest rate cost to the borrower. So,
going from 3% to 6% is real. So, we're around that level right now. It's about 1.75 to 1.85, what the five year
15

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Treasury. That's been the traditional short-term type multi-family product. We're really not quoting much on the
back-end on 10 and 7-year money, but if we do, do that, it's a higher spreads and was going to hopefully
synthetically structure that if you want to put on balance sheet so we can have a better interest rate risk profile
going forward.
And on the CRE side, tack another 50 basis points to that. So, you're in the mid-6s right now to the market. So,
that's a sizable change as indicated with the coupons in the 3s going to the 6s, with a lot of money that has to re-
price. We've offered a SOFR option. I think that's a good option for customers versus locking in fixed. It may take
a one-year approach towards floating and hope that rates may come down in the future. But we're giving that
option to customers and it's been about a close to 50% receptivity with that as long as they are actually re-pricing
in the periods, we think that's going to bode well for our future interest rate risk management opportunity when we
think about the combined balance sheets going forward.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. Okay. And then, if the Fed starts hiking in early 2023, do you have any idea on where
and perhaps when after the Fed stops hiking, you could see the core NIM stabilize for New York Community
standalone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Matt, we're not going to get forward guidance. But obviously, if that does take place, it's positive for a liability-
sensitive balance sheet, ex the consolidation of Flagstar. So, clearly, on a standalone basis, we're running at the
dot plot we're planning for continuing hikes and we're prepared for that. But in the event as they pivot, I think that's
going to be a positive shift on a standalone basis for our business model.
On a combined basis, we'd have an opportunity to really think about where we want to put our balance sheet, look
at the transformational opportunity here and set the balance sheet for what's prepared for the future. And I think
that's the real excitement of the upside. But in the event that we look on a standalone basis, we're prepared for
the forward dot plot and is a period where we have rising interest rates continuing, I think, for the first quarter,
then eventually going down towards the back end of 2023. And with that being said, we'll prepare for making sure
that we have solid focus on deposit gathering.
We're going to continue focusing on building out our funding mechanism here as we grow the institution and
culturally, there's been a drive towards we make loans with deposits. We're not going to make the loans to
customers that are not going to bring the deposits. That's been a cultural shift here. That's been successful. As
we talked about some of the other initiatives, it's all about deposits, deposits, deposits as we go forward here on
our vision as we transition from a thrift to a commercial bank with the acceleration of putting together two balance
sheets where, in Sandro's perspective, he has been working on this for quite some time and you can see the
results, he is showing a very strong margin because of the assets are all re-pricing and its funding is very different
than our funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then, just going back to the deal, what is the estimated first year accretion from the deal?
And then, at the current price, what is the expected bargain purchase gain?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, we'll start out the – the bargain purchase gain is really highly dependent on two things, right, the final
purchase accounting marks and the stock price at the day of closing. So, we estimated as of 09/30, given where
we think the marks will come out and assuming a current stock price, we're just under a $200 million bargain
purchase gain is our estimate. Like I said, those two items will be the driver really along with, of course, the equity
growth in the quarter on the Flagstar balance sheet. So, that's our estimate right now, moves around pretty
significantly, depending on stock price and the final purchase accounting mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, due to interest rates of course. We really haven't updated our guidance, I think I mentioned earlier on
earnings accretion from the deal. So we're at that 16% level that we announced originally. So, we haven't really
updated that as we've gone along. We still believe the deal is highly accretive, especially in this marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I'm going to say one point to that. The energy level and the time spent on analyzing the P&L and how these
companies work together, we're pretty confident on our original cost savings estimates and if anything, having this
excess time to really understand how these processes work together, we feel very confident on what our
estimates were on cost savings, for sure.

Hey, good morning. I want to go back to a comment Sandro made earlier about they're excited, the optimism

maybe a comment, is that the right kind of read?

Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, well, if it's me, yes, my comment, I don't think you should read anything into it. Every earnings call we've
had, we've always talked about what we think the opportunity is. And so we're being consistent with what we said
previously. The regulatory process is what it is. And we're going to continue to work towards what would it – what
would – what it would be if we get an approval until such time as we don't get one. So, we're still focused on it.
But no, I don't think you should read anything into any of our comments today other than, we're still hopeful
because we see that the, as we always have, we've seen that the opportunity and power of the combined
organization is really something special.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Okay. Thank you for that color. Just on the dividend, obviously, you're comfortably earning it now, but maybe
thoughts pro forma on the dividend, I guess with or without Flagstar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So look, we have a long history here of a very strong dividend, and it's a very focused capital management
process. We are very comfortable with asset quality. We're very comfortable with how we look at our capital
deployment. And going forward, we feel very strongly that we'll continue to pay a very strong dividend. And
obviously, this has been our history and culture of the company going back for decades. So we're very confident.
Company had record earnings going into this in the beginning of the first half of this year. We're seeing some
margin pressure based on substantial movements on Fed action. However, over time, this company will navigate
through it, and we will have strong asset quality, and foster a, on a standalone basis, a very focused expense
management philosophy, to generate good returns to our shareholders, at a very strong dividend. So, that's
always been our culture. On a projected combined basis, we just earn more money.
