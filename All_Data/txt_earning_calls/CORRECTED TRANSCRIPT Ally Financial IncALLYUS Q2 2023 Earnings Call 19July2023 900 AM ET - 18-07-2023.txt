Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Sean. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Before I start into details on the quarter, I'd like
to take a moment to officially welcome our new CFO, Russ Hutchinson, to Ally. I've known Russ for nearly 15
years, and he's been one of my most reliable and trusted advisors during my time as CEO. He is a terrific addition
to our team and a great partner to the investment community, many of whom have relationships with Russ
already. Russ, welcome, and why don't I turn to you to see if there's any comments you'd like to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thanks, JB. As JB mentioned, I have firsthand knowledge of Ally's excellent culture from working with this
leadership team over many years. I'm thrilled to be joining the company now as Ally stays with a particularly rich
set of opportunities across its Auto Finance and Ally Bank businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Russ, and again, welcome. And with that, I'm going to begin on slide number 4. Adjusted EPS of
$0.96, core ROTCE of 14%, and revenues of $2.1 billion demonstrate our ability to execute in a dynamic
operating environment. Net interest margin of 3.4% was generally in line with our expectations as we continue to
absorb the impacts of rapidly rising short-term interest rates. Given the continued changes in market interest
rates, margin pressures are more severe from a few months ago. We'll discuss that in detail as we navigate the
presentation deck.
While the bank funding market has been relatively stable since the events of mid-March, we continue to hold a
conservative liquidity posture anchored by our leading deposits franchise. Retail deposits were up nearly $0.5
billion, despite seasonal headwinds related to tax payments and a host of other factors pressuring deposit flows.
Insured balances increased $1.3 billion in the quarter and now represent 92% of the portfolio. Total available
liquidity of $42.5 billion was effectively flat quarter-over-quarter and is equivalent to 3.8 times our uninsured
deposit balances. CET1 ended the quarter at 9.3% and exceeds our regulatory minimum by $3.7 billion.
Operational performance in the quarter was steady across the company. Within Auto Finance, 3.5 million
applications powered us to generate $10.4 billion of originations at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We highlighted
this last quarter, but I want to reiterate that we see around $100 billion of potential originations in any given
quarter, allowing us to be selective in what we book to the balance sheet. Net charge-offs in the quarter were 132
basis points, which was down from prior quarter, but was slightly elevated relative to expectations. Brad will talk
more about the second quarter loss performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. Within Insurance, we
continue to successfully grow and deepen dealer relationships, as $299 million of written premiums were up 14%
year-over-year.
Turning to Ally Bank. Total deposits of $154 billion are up $13.9 billion year-over-year as we continue to grow our
deposit customer base, now approaching 3 million. We have over 1 million active credit cardholders and remain
excited about long-term opportunities for this business. We've launched our One Ally digital experience and
expect to complete the full rebranding of Ally Credit Card later this year. Corporate Finance continues to deliver
accretive, disciplined growth, as nearly 100% of the $10.1 billion portfolio is in a first lien position.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Turning to slide number 5. I remain incredibly proud of the culture we've established and it's critical to our success
as we navigate periods of uncertainty. Culture has always been a top priority for me and we continue to see
tangible impacts from our efforts. Our 11,700 teammates provide diverse perspectives and contributions, and our
leadership team is focused on maintaining strong engagement across every level of the organization. We recently
completed another company engagement survey, and I'm proud that we remained in the top 10% of global
companies and were 8 points higher than the financial services benchmark.
We remain focused on being a source of strength for consumer, commercial, and dealer customers. Year-to-date,
customer obsession has resulted in satisfaction scores of nearly 90% and customer retention of 96%. Stronger
communities mean a stronger Ally, and we were thrilled to recently announce nearly $1 billion in giving and
lending support for affordable housing initiatives. I'm proud of Ally's ability to make a difference in home
affordability, which remains a key challenge in many communities. Our culture is authentic, unique, and a key
differentiator in delivering long-term results.
On slide number 6, we wanted to directly address some of the critical items we're navigating today. This is a
unique time in the industry and our company, and I'm confident in our leadership team and teammates, who have
successfully navigated numerous challenging environments before. From an interest rate perspective, we've
talked for multiple quarters about the near-term challenges of a rapidly rising interest rate environment.
Operationally, throughout the cycle, the businesses have been discipline in managing pricing on both sides of the
balance sheet. We've also utilized our strong ALCO processes, including an active hedging program to protect the
company from higher-for-longer rates scenarios.
Beyond the near-term pressure, the momentum we have on the asset side of the balance sheet positions us well
for margin expansion when rates stabilize. Inflation data we saw last week shows that policy may be working to
slow pressures, and obviously, that will be a significant positive for us going forward. Managing credit risk
continues to remain a top priority. We've refined our buy-box to eliminate underperforming segments and add
significant price, particularly in riskier segments to compensate for potential volatility.
Based on where we see things to date, we'd expect retail auto NCOs of 1.8% for the full year, which is in line with
the range we provided in January. This is unique environment where unemployment remains historically low;
however, persistent inflation is a challenge for many consumers. Delinquencies remain a watch item and remain
elevated entering the second half of the year. And consistent with prior guides, we assume a meaningful step
down in used vehicle values for the remainder of the year. The team we've built and the investments we've made
in collections and servicing will drive solid performance even in a challenging environment.
On the regulatory front, we're preparing for increased capital and liquidity across the industry, and expect
Category IV banks are likely to see requirements more like those of the G-SIBs at some point in the future. I won't
advocate whether or not that is appropriate, as I firmly believe tailoring works, but I think we are being realistic in
our thoughts for the future. We're well positioned from a liquidity standpoint and we're building capital to prepare
for these expected changes. We maintain constructive working relationships with the regulatory community and
look forward to clarity on potential changes in the regulatory framework. Understandably, though, there's a lot of
focus on near-term pressures and potential for increased regulation. Overall, I feel strongly the company is well
positioned to deliver earnings growth over the next several years, and as rates turn, we are more uniquely
positioned to benefit than most in the industry.
Let's turn to slide number 7, where we've highlighted the strength of our market-leading consumer deposit
franchise. Since Ally Bank's inception in 2009, we've continued to provide customers not just another bank
offering, but rather a better approach to banking. Our seamless digital customer experience has resonated as

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
we're now approaching 3 million retail deposit customers. Millennial and younger demographics represent most of
our growth, which highlights the opportunity ahead. Given the construct of our consumer deposit portfolio, 92% of
deposits are FDIC insured, among the highest levels in the industry, and customer retention of 96% continues to
demonstrate the loyalty of our customers once they've opened an Ally account and experience our customer-
centric digital approach. We've recently received recognition from The Wall Street Journal for being their Favorite
Online Bank, again, another positive recognition to our approach to banking.
Moving to slide number 8, we provided a snapshot of our current funding stack and available liquidity. We're core
funded with deposits, as they comprise 87% of our funding, but importantly, we have multiple sources of liquidity
beyond deposits. In fact, over the past three months, we've accessed every one of our non-deposit funding
sources, including public secured and unsecured debt transactions. We were the first Category IV bank to issue
unsecured debt since the events of March, and the transaction, which was TLAC eligible, was very well received,
demonstrating confidence in our financial profile. On the right side, we show total available liquidity of $42.5
billion, representing 3.8 times uninsured deposit balances, and for context, cash on hand at quarter end
represented over 80% of our uninsured deposit balances. While markets have been mostly calm in recent
months, we know that can change quickly and we felt it was appropriate to highlight the strength and resilience of
the liquidity footprint again this quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad to cover our detailed financial results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 9.
Net financing revenue, excluding OID, of $1.6 billion was down year-over-year, driven by higher funding costs,
given the rapid increase in short-term rates, as liquid savings products comprise the majority of our consumer
deposits portfolio, partially offset by higher earning asset yields, given the strengthened auto pricing, increased
floating rate assets, our hedging program, and growth across unsecured products. Adjusted other revenue of
$481 million increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting momentum across our Insurance and
SmartAuction businesses. We see a path for expanding other revenue across the back half of 2023, moving
towards a $500 million quarterly run rate.
Provision expense of $427 million was down quarter-over-quarter, reflecting seasonal trends and a modest
reserve build. I'll provide more granular commentary on charge-off trends shortly. Noninterest expense of $1.2
billion reflects the highest second quarter weather losses realized since 2020, in addition to disciplined
investments across technology and variable servicing and collection costs. Despite elevated weather losses,
year-over-year growth in total expenses declined relative to the first quarter. We expect favorable year-over-year
expense trends as we progress through the second half of 2023. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter were
$0.99 and $0.96, respectively.
Moving to slide 10. Net interest margin, excluding OID, of 3.41% was generally in line with expectations, down 13
basis points quarter-over-quarter. We see momentum within earning asset yields, but the increase in short-term
rates will continue to pressure cost of funds as we discussed previously. We continue to maintain a conservative
liquidity position, including elevated cash balances. All of this pressured margin by a few basis points in the
quarter. We believe this is a prudent tradeoff in the current environment.
Our longer-term view of NIM trajectory is largely unchanged, but given the rate environment, we currently see full-
year 2023 NIM around 3.4%. I'll share more detail on NIM dynamics and outlook shortly.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Our approach to underwriting and focus on risk-adjusted returns slightly lowered our retail originated yield this
quarter. As we continue to originate loans in the mid-10% range, we see significant tailwinds in future periods as
more recent originations comprise a growing share of the overall portfolio. Total average loans and leases of $148
billion are up $11 billion year-over-year, driven by growth within retail auto and a gradual normalization of
commercial auto balances. Quarter-over-quarter growth of less than $1 billion reflects our focus on disciplined
capital deployment.
Earning asset yield of 6.99% increased 28 basis points quarter-over-quarter and nearly 200 basis points year-
over-year, given the cumulative impact of trends as discussed previously, including retail auto portfolio yield
expansion, the increasing contribution from higher yielding assets, and over $60 billion of floating rate exposure
across our commercial loan and hedging portfolios, partially offset by our maintenance of elevated cash levels
mentioned previously. Retail portfolio yield expanded 32 basis points from the prior quarter, as recent vintages
comprise a larger portion of the portfolio.
At quarter end, nearly 60% of the portfolio consisted of loans originated since 2022, when the tightening cycle
commenced. Concurrently, we've added 460 basis points of price, which will provide significant tailwinds in future
periods, and our hedging program continues to provide incremental benefit to the retail auto portfolio yield.
Commercial portfolio yields expanded alongside benchmark rates given their floating rate nature.
Turning to liabilities. Cost of funds increased 45 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 273 basis points year-over-
year. The increase in deposit cost reflects continued increases in short-term rates and a highly competitive market
for deposits.
On slide 11, we provide an updated view of our expectations for retail auto and deposit pricing, the two largest
drivers of our margin trajectory. Our current expectation for full year NIM of around 3.4% is based on the forward
curve, which now assumes peak Fed Funds of 5.5% and no rate cuts until 2024. Despite this pressure, we remain
confident in the underlying momentum, which will lead to NIM expansion in future periods.
Retail auto portfolio yield expanded again this quarter as we continue to originate well above the overall portfolio
yield. Originated yield declined in the quarter as we've increased the super-prime proportion of our volume.
Disruption in the market has enabled us to capture super-prime share with minimal change in price. Returns in
this segment are significantly higher than normal, and we've taken the opportunity to optimize risk-adjusted
returns. This shift demonstrates the benefit of our scale and ability to adapt to market conditions.
Current originations are still well above portfolio yields, which will drive portfolio yield to 9% by yearend. Deposit
pricing reflects a dynamic environment with banks competing with each other and investment alternatives to
capture deposits. We expect the retail deposits portfolio yield to continue migrating toward current liquid savings
rates. Clearly, there are a range of possible outcomes given the current backdrop, but we remain confident in our
balance sheet positioning and corresponding NIM trajectory. And while we've seen pressure to our full year NIM
outlook, we see a steady migration up to 4% over time, even without the benefit of rate cuts.
Moving to slide 12. Our CET1 ratio increased quarter-over-quarter to 9.3%, given our disciplined approach to
capital allocation. We announced another quarterly common dividend of $0.30 for the third quarter, and loan
growth will be modest and focused on attractive risk-adjusted returns. At current levels, we exceed our 7%
regulatory minimum for CET1 by $3.7 billion. While Ally was not subject to this year's DFAST exercise, our Stress
Capital Buffer remains unchanged at the minimum 2.5%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
The bottom-right provides our current TCE ratio and a pro forma view of CET1 in the unlikely scenario where the
AOCI filter is fully removed. Even without the expected benefit of a gradual phased in, pro forma CET1 of 6.9% is
in line with our 7% regulatory minimum and is expected to increase naturally. As a reminder, nearly all of our
securities portfolio is held in AFS, meaning we don't have a large unrealized loss sitting in held to maturity, and
we have continued to allow the securities portfolio to roll down with minimal reinvestment over the past 12
months.
Let's turn to slide 13 to review asset quality trends. Consolidated net charge-offs of 116 basis points were down
quarter-over-quarter as we saw typical seasonal trends, partially offset by a specific charge-off within Corporate
Finance. The charge-off within Corporate Finance added 16 basis points to the consolidated rate. This exposure
was fully reserved for previously and did not impact provision expense in the quarter. Retail auto net charge-offs
of 132 basis points were down versus the prior quarter, but slightly higher than prior guidance. We continue to see
mostly offsetting impacts of elevated loss frequency and favorable severity benefiting from higher used values. I'll
cover retail auto charge-offs in more detail shortly.
In the bottom-right, 30-day delinquencies increased 36 basis points quarter-over-quarter. More specifically, the
30-day delinquency rate rose less than we typically see in a normalized environment. Delinquencies will increase
seasonally throughout the second half of 2023 and we continue to assess the impact of inflation, but the
investments we've made will support our ability to communicate with consumers and mitigate losses.
Slide 14 shows that consolidated coverage declined 2 basis points to 2.72%, given the release of specific
reserves related to the Corporate Finance charge-off mentioned previously. The total reserve balance at $3.8
billion was flat quarter-over-quarter and is $1.2 billion higher than CECL day 1. Our macro assumption
deployment conditions with unemployment reaching 4.6% next year before increasing to approximately 6.2%
under our reversion to historical mean methodology. Retail auto coverage increased 2 basis points to 3.62% and
remains well above the 3.34% on CECL day 1. The remaining weighted average life of our retail auto portfolio
remains under two years, demonstrating the coverage we have for expected lifetime losses of this portfolio.
On slide 15, we share our credit trends we've seen so far through June and our outlook for the year. As noted
previously, we ended the quarter with NCOs of 1.3%, which were slightly elevated versus expectations. The
drivers of this increase are consistent with the themes we talked about today and on our prior earnings call.
Delinquencies entering the quarter were elevated, as we did not see the typical seasonal decline coming out of
tax refund season earlier this year. Flow-to-loss rates remain stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels, but we
did see elevated loss frequency late in the quarter. Those losses occurred at the same time the industry saw
several weeks of declining wholesale vehicle values, which further added to the pressure through the end of the
quarter.
While delinquencies remain a watch item, we saw the smallest second quarter increase in 30-day delinquencies
since the pandemic, and year-over-year increases continue to decline. Used vehicle values are a driver of loss
severity and we feel our assumed decline in the second half of the year is appropriately conservative. On the
bottom-left, we've again provided quarterly loss expectations, which result in a full year loss rate of around 1.8%.
On the right side, we've included a summary of some of the key underwriting decisions we've made as we
leverage detailed segmentation and analytics to optimize our risk-adjusted returns.
Slide 16 provides our latest view for used vehicle values given performance year-to-date, which saw values
increase 5%. We are currently forecasting a 12% decline in values across the back half of 2023, which would
result in a full year decline of 8%, roughly in line with what we shared last quarter. Beyond 2023, we expect
elevated values relative to pre-pandemic levels, given the constraint on used vehicle supply.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Turning to slide 17. Retail deposits of $139 billion increased $486 million quarter-over-quarter and $7.8 billion
year-over-year, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our leading franchise. Importantly, insured balances
were up $1.3 billion this quarter and represent 92% of total balances. Total deposits of $154 billion are up $14
billion year-over-year. Following the record customer growth in the first quarter, we added another 86,000 new
customers, our 57th consecutive quarter of growth. More than 10% of deposit customers now have a relationship
with Ally Invest, Home or Credit Card, and we see opportunities across Ally's growing customer base as we
expand and deepen relationships as consumer preferences continue to migrate towards digital offerings.
Moving to slide 18. Our digital bank platforms provide diversification and deepen consumer relationships. Ally
Invest complements the deposit franchise well, as 85% of new accounts were from existing customers, as they
leverage the ease of money movement between accounts within Ally. Ally Credit Card added 49,000 new
cardholders in the quarter, now 1.1 million strong. Balances increased a modest $100 million, reflecting our
discipline, given the current backdrop. Going forward, we'll continue to look for opportunities to prudently market
to the existing Ally customer base. Ally Lending is focused on deepening merchant relationships within home
improvement and healthcare verticals. Like the Ally Credit Card, our disciplined approach to underwriting and
capital allocation resulted in modest growth quarter-over-quarter.
Let's move to slide 19 to cover Auto segment results. Pre-tax income of $501 million reflected pricing momentum,
alongside higher provision expense. On the bottom-left, we highlight the intentional shift we made in our
origination profile over the past several months. Uncertainty in the market has caused a number of lenders to
reduce or exit their position in the marketplace, creating an opportunity for Ally to win incremental business. Our
strategy to drive overall application volume and increase the top of the funnel enables us to see the entire market
and focus on risk-adjusted returns. The bottom-right chart summarizes lease termination trends. While used
values declined from March to June, average auction proceeds were slightly favorable quarter-over-quarter. A
higher number of lease terminations in the period also led to an increase in remarketing gains versus the prior
quarter.
Slide 20 highlights a few ways in which the auto business continues to evolve and develop in order to serve our
dealer customers even better, while driving attractive economics for Ally. SmartAuction is our web-based auction
platform that enables dealer-to-dealer transactions, generating fee revenue for Ally, while providing real-time data
on market pricing and trends. Despite a meaningful reduction in industry volume, SmartAuction revenue is
projected to be up more than 60% versus 2019, and unit volume up more than 50% since just last year. We see
tremendous opportunity to leverage our platform for additional white label relationships, providing efficient,
incremental revenue.
On the right side of the slide, we highlight pass-through program revenue. Given our strategy to drive increased
application volume mentioned above, we now see more than 1 million applications per month, allowing us to be
selective and maximize risk-adjusted returns. For certain loans that do not meet our underwriting criteria, we route
those application to relationship partners. Ally receives the fee for the origination and services of loans, allowing
us to generate efficient revenue while leveraging the scale of our servicing platform. Both initiatives represent
opportunity to further expand Ally's other revenue and demonstrate the strength and breadth of the Auto Finance
franchise.
Turning to slide 21. Our unique scale and deep dealer relationships allow Ally to engage in and support EV
adoption as the market develops. Originations of $347 million are up 42% year-over-year and represent our single
highest quarter of EV originations, demonstrating our reach in the marketplace. Consumer EV portfolio balance of
$1.5 billion is diversified across lease in retail and OEMs, and consists of plug-in hybrid and battery electric

vehicles. As we've highlighted previously, the synergies between Auto and Insurance are a competitive advantage
for Ally, and benefit our dealer and consumer customers.
In October of last year, we introduced a new insurance product designed specifically to cover plug-in hybrids and
battery electric vehicles. Our approach to EVs is consistent with our overall auto strategy to adapt to changing
environments, focus on our core strengths, and drive accretive returns. Ally's history of financing EVs goes back
more than 20 years, and we remain well positioned to support dealers and customers as consumer preferences
evolve and EV adoption grows.
Turning to slide 22. We remain focused on leveraging our differentiated go-to-market approach, coupling high-
tech and high-touch, which has generated significant scale and a competitive advantage. Applications volume of
3.5 million and 29% approval rate reflects the selective way in which we deploy capital. Ending assets in the top-
right were up slightly quarter-over-quarter as commercial balances gradually increase alongside modest growth in
retail auto.
Originations of $10.4 billion on the bottom of the page, display the scale of our franchise and the compelling
volume we're able to generate despite tighter underwriting criteria. Year-to-date, nearly $20 billion of origination
volume puts us on track to originate around $40 billion this year. Additionally, used comprised 64% of originations,
which was flat quarter-over-quarter as we progressed through the typical used vehicle selling season, and down 5
percentage points year-over-year, given the underwriting actions we've taken in recent quarters. Nonprime
represented just under 10% of retail originations in the quarter.
Turning to Insurance on slide 23. A core pre-tax loss of $16 million was a result of seasonally higher weather
losses, along with normalization of GAP losses, given decline in used car values. Keep in mind we do have
reinsurance in place for weather losses to limit our total exposure, but following several years of favorability, we
saw weather activity more in line with historical averages.
Written premiums of $299 million increased 14% year-over-year as we remained focused on increasing dealer
relationships and benefit from normalizing inventory levels. As a result of the momentum in written premiums,
earned premiums were up $27 million year-over-year with further expansion ahead. Our focus remains on
leveraging the scale we've established in Auto Finance and highlighting our full spectrum product suite to dealers
driving further integration of Insurance across our auto dealer base.
Corporate Finance results are on slide 24. Core pre-tax income of $71 million reflected disciplined portfolio growth
and the benefit of higher interest rates, given the entire portfolio is floating rate. The charge-off referenced earlier
resulted from the vertical we no longer originate, and didn't impact second quarter results, given specific reserves
posted in prior periods. The portfolio remains high quality, with roughly 60% asset based, and effectively 100% of
loans are in a first lien position. HFI portfolio balance of $10.1 billion has remained relatively flat year-to-date, with
modest growth expected to the rest of the year, reflecting the team's discipline and focus on maximizing risk-
adjusted returns.
Slide 25 includes details for Mortgage. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $21 million and $267 million of DTC
originations. We're not tied to any specific origination target, and instead remain focused on a great experience for
customers and have considerably reduced the expense flow to the business in light of market conditions.
Slide 26 contains our financial outlook for 2023. The operating environment remains dynamic and despite the
difficulty in providing granular guidance, we've continued the transparent approach we've taken over the past

several quarters. As we've highlighted previously, our guidance is based on expectations for interest rates,
specifically Fed Funds, which continue to change rapidly.
At the end of the first quarter, the market was expecting a peak Fed Funds of 5.25%, followed quickly by rate
cuts, with Fed Funds ending the year at 4.5%. At the end of the second quarter, the market expected Fed Funds
of 5.5% through yearend, a full 100 basis points higher than previously expected. Given the naturally liability-
sensitive nature of our balance sheet, that will put incremental pressure on NIM and see full year NIM of around
3.4% or 10 basis points lower than our previous expectations.
Our expectation for full year 2023 other revenue is closer to $1.9 billion, mainly due to some of the onetime items
we recorded earlier this year, but we remain confident in our ability to get to that $2 billion annual figure. As we
covered previously, retail auto portfolio yield is still projected around 9%, while funding costs have moved up,
given the changes in benchmark rates and the intense competition for deposits. Retail NCOs are expected to be
at 1.8% for the full year and no change to operating expense as we limit spend to nondiscretionary cost or
essential investments.
We see the tax rate closer to 18% for the year as we've had solid momentum in generating EV tax credits and
expect that trend to continue. While elevated and increasing interest rates are a headwind, we expect most of the
tightening cycle is behind us, and have positioned the balance sheet through margin and earnings growth over
the medium-term, and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive long-term profitability.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Thank you, Brad. The strategic priorities, which guide everything we do, are unwavering and essential for our
long-term success. First and foremost is, ensuring we maintain strong alignment between our culture and our
stakeholders. We're focused on highlighting the differentiated offerings across our businesses for both consumer
and commercial customers. We'll continue finding ways to disrupt the industry and remove friction for customers
by delivering leading digital experiences, and even more important in this dynamic environment is our disciplined
approach to risk management and capital allocation. I remain incredibly proud to lead our company, and over
time, I'm confident these priorities will help us deliver value for all stakeholders.
Before I close, I want to take a minute to thank Brad for the exceptional job he has done, serving as both the
Interim CFO and Corporate Treasurer over the past nine months. That would have been a huge task in a normal
operating environment, and the last nine months have been anything but that. Brad seamlessly expanded his
responsibility to lead the entire finance organization and the team continued to excel in everything they do. Brad,
thank you on behalf of the entire company.
And with that, Sean, I'll turn it back to you and head into Q&A.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please
proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the commentary. Maybe we could just dive into the NIM migration next
year. I think, Brad, you mentioned, you see a path to the 4%. Could you just talk about timing of how we get
there? Obviously, it sounds like you guys are able to go up market, and I assume that that has an impact on the
yield, but it also should have a better impact on provision. So, maybe you can just talk about those moving
dynamics there and maybe risk-adjusted margins as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. Good morning, Sanjay. So, a couple of things. As we called out, the two biggest drivers of that
trajectory being the retail auto portfolio yield which you highlighted, as well as really cost of funds pressure that
we've experienced, given the continued volatility and certainly increase we've seen in short-term rates. All of that
to say that those dynamics have really led us to get down to that sort of 3.4% for full year 2023.
And then, a couple of things I would mention just around – you highlighted it as well – around what we've been
able to really pass through from a retail auto yield perspective. They're balancing risk-adjusted returns, which
again are at historical highs in terms of what we continue to see there and the balanced approach we've taken
around maintaining those risk-adjusted yields, and certainly loss content or expected loss content as well. And
then, on the cost of funds side, again, just continued volatility in short-term rates.
From an overall deposit pricing perspective, which is the biggest driver there, we feel like when you look at the
performance that we've had over the first half of the year, we're very pleased with overall. When you consider a
number of things, one, the short-term rates, of course, and we highlighted the intense competition for deposits
both among banks, but with alternative investments as well being so attractive. A dynamic there in banks, I mean,
one of our promise has always been that direct banks will have a competitive advantage given the rate that we
pay, we've seen a pretty big pivot in terms of aggression really across the industry on rates paid on deposits.
So, that certainly has put pressure on those rates, but when you think about Ally more specifically, when you look
at the first half, we've grown record customers in the first quarter. We grew another 86,000 this quarter, if that's
not a record for first half, it's certainly second best ever. At the same time, we've grown balances, and retention
and engagement remain very high. All of this, in not being or really lagging at least certainly the top five payers on
liquid products. So, all that to say, once we get past the peak in Fed Funds and they pause, we will expand
margins from there, maybe a quarter or two later. When you go into full year 2024, that's when we really expect to
see that margin expansion, which will be a primary driver of that long-term trajectory of profitability. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then, maybe you can just help us think about like reserve coverage on a go-forward basis,
because you do have the higher losses, but the delinquency rate seems to be trending in a positive direction, and

then you might have a more favorable mix shift. Maybe you can just help us think about the reserve coverage
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. And you saw us take that up a little bit in retail auto by a couple basis points this quarter. And I think
that's really directionally when we think about the activity in the actuals that we saw in the second quarter, we
entered the second quarter, as we talked about with elevated delinquencies. The seasonal decline that we
expected in first quarter, we didn't see as much, but we did see an increase less than expected here in the
second quarter. And so, we're also really navigating that with this backdrop of persistent inflation and just higher
demands in financial obligations for customers. And couple that with potential higher loss frequency, we've talked
[indiscernible] (00:42:49) that in our assumptions there. All of those dynamics together kind of lead us toward that
1.8% for full year 2023. So, when you think about that, we don't see a significant coverage – anticipating coverage
for retail auto certainly as the biggest driver, given those dynamics, and then again, that is supported through the
12 months' reasonable and supportable forecast that we have, and then a reversion to the historical mean from
there.

from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So, just wanted to dig into the NIM trajectory a little bit more. It seems like you're looking for the back half of
the year NIM to kind of hold steady to maybe a little bit lower from here. Just wanted to maybe dig into the
components a little bit more and how we should be thinking about the trajectory of your deposit funding. I know
you have the OSA at about 4% today, your one-year CD is about 4.85%, and I realize you're guiding to an OSA of
12

about 4.1%. But just given that the competition is already above that today, one of your competitors just raised
today, just wondering how you're thinking about offsetting funding cost and maybe how we should be thinking
about higher-for-longer rate environment into 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Jeff. I'll take that. So, I guess, from a deposit pricing perspective, I know I say we are at 4%. If you
kind of look at how we've kind of priced through the journey here in the tightening cycle, right, we expected the
market does another hike next week. So, when you think about what I would say as we anticipate that Fed hike in
our guidance that we provided right, we – that certainly is factored in as well. And then, all the other elements that
I talked about as well in terms of intense competition, just continued pressure on rates, all of those are embedded
in that balance as well. And then, importantly, we expect the portfolio yield will migrate toward, as I said, the liquid
rates that we're paying as well. So, that's the deposit pricing side, which is a huge driver.
Now, to your point, we've also been highlighting the fact that this near-term pressure, one of the things that we've
been doing is really positioning the balance sheet where we can by converting or swapping fixed assets to
floating. That really is a significant benefit to us, particularly as the bridge to help mitigate some of this pressure
near-term. For example, it's probably $200 million or so just in NII this quarter, which also translate to significant
benefit to NIM. The sculpting of notional really does help here until sort of early 2024 or so. So, to me, that also is
embedded in the guidance of us in terms of the longer-term NIM view as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Jeff, I think you've got it ballpark right. I mean, we see sort of trough in NIM approaching some point later this
year, and I think as Brad mentioned in his response to Sanjay, I think a quarter or two after the Fed is done, and
we can all guess when that's going to be, you'll start to see pretty rapid margin expansion. And then, to the extent,
you get eases, that really starts to accelerate, but I think your timing around you're getting closer to sort of a
bottom is spot on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And if we think about the credit outlook from here, appreciate the updated color on the
trajectory from here. Do you have an update on how you're maybe thinking about 2024 as we're sitting here
almost six months away? I know before you talked about getting that back down to a retail auto loss rate of 1.6%.
And how are you thinking about that? And maybe relative to the prior update you had given us on the second half
2022, early 2023 vintage performing better than the prior-year vintage, are you still seeing that or is there an
update there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, I'll start. So, I guess just it as relates to the 2024, our expectations around auto NCO. So, you did see
us kind of guide out to the 1.8%, higher end of the range here for this year. I think a number of things, obviously,
are dependent there, right, in terms of, obviously, the macros and certainly where they go. I think that one of the
13

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
things that we highlighted in the earnings presentation was this sort of slowing both quarter-over-quarter and
year-over-year increase in delinquencies and net charge-off trajectory as well. I think some of that's factored in as
we continue to migrate through 2023 here and into 2024.
And then to your point, those sort of earlier, let's say, more front book type of vintages have been more of an
impact in terms of what we're seeing, both on those elevated delinquencies as well as ultimate charge-offs. And
so, those also are drivers and we kind of spelled out where we see those vintages reaching their peak loss
periods. All of that to say, 2024, given the guide that we've given for 2023, we would see some of that most likely
bleed into 2024 as well, given those dynamics. And then, we can't lose sight of the fact that risk-adjusted returns
are, again, higher than ever. And when you think about the underwriting actions that we've taken to tighten and all
the dynamics there, coupled with the investments we continue to make in servicing and collections, we feel pretty
balanced about how we're teed up to navigate the rest of this year and certainly 2024, again, continued upon the
macro backdrop shifting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
And I think on that pricing power point, the other thing is, look, the competitive environment right now for us is
pretty sweet. I mean, you've seen a number of players decide that they want to exit auto lending. And so, that
makes for a pretty rich set for us. I think, obviously, with respect to Chase, I'm sure you looked at their originations
last week. I think, quarter-over-quarter, they were up in the neighborhood of 30%. So, they're still – for people that
are in and committed, like Chase, like Capital One, like ourselves, it's still a very attractive market opportunity at
very aggressive returns right now. So, we recognize credit may be a little bumpier than expected, but the ROEs
that we're putting on are pretty much at lifetime highs for the company. And so, we like the business, you got to
have scale, and I think for the players that are consistently there, it's a really attractive market for us.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Maybe I'll switch gears a little bit. So, the expense guide appears to be a little bit of a step down in the back half of
the year, and I think you guys mentioned a little bit more of a harder look at costs. Can you maybe just talk about
some of the drivers of the step down, ex the weather-related insurance costs, and given the potential for slower
earning asset growth, could we see expense growth start to flatten out in the coming quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Ryan, I think you're spot on. So, first, the trajectory on the first half of the year is definitely richer than what
we see on the back half of the year. And I think, the past three months, the entire leadership team has really,
appropriately responded to the message of clamping down on all fronts. And in fact, largely outside of kind of new
hires and new interns, and one-offs here and there, we've effectively paused hiring as a corporation. There's not a
hard mandate per se, but I think there's a very high hurdle rate to bring on new talent into the company right now.
And so, we see the back half trajectory this year being much different than what we experienced for the first six
months of this year. And so, that starts to get you back in line with the overall expense guide that Brad gave.
And then, I think the message into 2024, which, clearly on the analyst community's minds, is going to be a much
different trajectory. I mean, we've supported a lot of growth. They've been in smart areas like technology and
brand and continued hiring in the company, I think just recognizing the environment we're in, it's going to be a
much different story entering 2024 and, yeah, there are uncontrollable things, like you alluded to FDIC fees and
things like that. But I think the controllables, the things that are within our power, expect a very different expense
trajectory out of the company going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, I think Brad highlighted the adjusted capital ratio being around 7%. JB or Brad,
can you maybe just talk about how you expect to manage capital over the medium-term, just given the need to
get back to this, let's call it, 9-percent-plus level? And maybe is there any optimization strategies across the
balance sheet that you could potentially pursue to get capital back towards your targeted levels? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Ryan, so I'll start. Brad, feel free – or Russ, feel free to dive in. I think, one, we showed that kind of fully
phased in as just the draconian view. I think the reality is, we're hearing anywhere from two years to five years as
an appropriate phase in. And so, we're waiting to see. But I think our point was, look, even if you jam this down
our throats on day one, we're already basically at the regulatory minimum. So, there's not a problem per se, and
there's not a need to go do anything out of line. And I think that important reminder that Brad gave in his prepared
remarks is no HTM. I mean, the company has chosen AFS for a reason, and yes, it presents some more volatility
and some more pressure, but I think it affords us a lot more flexibility, and I think you see that when you look at
our TCE ratio relative to others that are out there.
And so, for us, managing capital is going to be very appropriate, but I think we're waiting to some degree on
regulatory clarity as to how this all times out. I think for now, obviously, dividend is well intact. We announced that
and that's full speed ahead. With buybacks, I think, we continue to be in no-buyback mode for the moment right
now. We have had conversation around optimizing certain assets on balance sheet. We don't think that's
necessarily a push to do, but these are things we constantly look at, and we will continue to look at. And so, for
now, Ryan, we feel really good about the state of capital, level of our capital. Obviously, 9% is our kind of baseline

internal target and we think you'll gradually get up there, but some of this just depends on the time and pace on
which we get a message out of [ph] DC Fed (00:54:41) on how these things are going to pan out.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Arren
Cyganovich with Citi. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the health of the auto market, and we're seeing
commercial loans start to rise a bit, but still below pre-pandemic levels, and how the mix of new and used could
change over the next couple of years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Arren, thanks for the question, and I'll start. Brad, again, feel free to dive in. Overall health of the market, it's
pretty solid right now. I mean a couple things I'd point out. We're still very much supply constrained, and while
you've seen some gradual uptick in inventories and you've seen commercial balances migrate slightly higher,
we're still in a relatively constrained market. And particularly it differs by OEM-by-OEM, but I think overall, we still
see things being very constrained, and obviously, that provides support for the used car market and you see
where we continue to be a big player there.
I think on the dealer health front, you probably noticed there were a couple of charge-offs in the dealer space
today. I mean, these were dealers that we had on watch, and I think that's just got to be a trend that we evaluate.
We think overall dealer health is still really good, but that's just kind of a newer development. We had a net
recovery last year and we've had effectively no charge-offs there. So, this is just sort of a new dynamic that's out
there. But I think generally speaking, the big dealers that we tend to do business with, that are our largest
relationships, are still seeing really strong profitability, really strong results, really strong consumer demand, so
things are really supportive there. The online players, obviously, Carvana was out this morning with some
announcements on their restructuring and demonstrating good earnings trends there. So, net-net, we see the
industry overall still being very healthy and I think very supportive for where we play.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
And maybe just to add a couple of comments and balance sheet. From an overall earning asset perspective, auto
assets of $115 billion or so, we've done a little bit of trade, as commercial balances have been down, a little more
retail auto. So, from a capital connection perspective, we really don't have aspiration to see that change, and I
think we have opportunity between both of those. And to JB's point, we've seen commercial balances normalize

slowly. We don't expect them to get back to where they were anytime soon, pre-pandemic. And so, again, we feel
good about our ability to support our customers while also being disciplined on capital allocation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. And on Credit Card, you're growing that at a nice pace. It's still, obviously, really small relative to your
balance sheet. But could you remind us what kind of credit quality customer you're putting into that book as you
grow that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, I think it's really not that different when you think about sort of overall average FIDO, retail auto being
around 700-ish today, Credit Card is probably – is most likely in that range as well. Again, for us, Credit Card is –
it's a significant opportunity to really expand and deepen relationships as we talked about in certainly white space,
right, which is one of the reasons we entered that market back in December of 2021. So, as JB highlighted in his
remarks, the journey continues there. There's a lot of opportunity, right, for us to really expand across Ally's total
11-plus million customers. And so, I think that opportunity is great. At the same time, we are very mindful of the
unsecured risk and the nature of that book, but also our continued allocation of capital, particularly in this
uncertain backdrop. So, very careful and disciplined on that approach as well.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, everybody, for taking my questions. And Russ, welcome; and Brad, thank you for all the help over the
last year. Just wanted to talk a little bit. Last quarter, there was commentary that the flow-to-loss ratios were pretty
good. I'm curious in the context of what you're seeing with loss severities potentially picking up in the second half,
given your outlook for used car prices, if you think that there will sort of be a rational expectations in behavior of
higher loss frequency as used car prices decline and consumers potentially increasingly strategically default.

Bradley J. Brown A
Corporate Treasurer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hey. And good morning, Rick, and appreciate your comments there. A couple quick things, I know we're
almost out of time here. On the flow-to-loss perspective, two things I would say, stable and still favorable versus
pre-pandemic level. So, that's certainly a positive. We've talked and highlighted about loss severity as well, given
the used vehicle dynamics. We also highlighted given the year we've seen dynamics and values different than we
initially expected, but we're now, for the second half of this year, assuming a further 10% or 12%, it would have to

be a 12% decline. So, all of that sort of factored into our guidance and expectations when we look at the NCO
