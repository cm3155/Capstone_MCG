Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks,
Terry and I will take your questions.
I'll begin on slide 3. We reported earnings per share of $0.90, which included $0.18 per share of notable items,
which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per
share of $1.08 for the quarter.
Loan growth was driven by new client wins and deepening relationships across all our loan portfolios and we
delivered very strong deposit growth. We continue to see strong account and volume growth across our key
businesses.
Credit quality was stable and our book value per share increased 6.7% from a year ago. In November, we
received approval from the Federal Reserve for an incremental share repurchase plan authorizing repurchases up
to $2.5 million of common stock in addition to our existing authorization of $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, we
returned $2.9 billion of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
As indicated on slide 4, digital uptake trends remain strong. We are significantly ramping up the launch of our DIY
digital experiences that will continue to drive more and more customer interactions both on and off the mobile app
as well as higher digital transaction volume.
Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On a core basis, we delivered an 18.1% return on tangible common
equity in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our core return on tangible common equity was 18.8%.
Now, I'll turn it over to Terry who will provide detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth
quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and increased 3.9% year-over-year.
Linked quarter growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages, commercial real estate, and credit card
loans.
In C&I, paydown activity muted overall growth in the fourth quarter, primarily reflected in the rate environment and
robust capital market conditions. New commercial business activity is healthy; however, paydown activity is likely
to continue to be a headwind near-term, albeit a diminishing headwind assuming that the interest rate
environment is stable.
Turning to slide 7, deposits increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 6.6% year-over-year. Notably,
average savings deposits grew by 11.1%, driven by across-the-board growth in Wealth Management, Investment
Services, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.
Turning to slide 8, credit quality was stable in the fourth quarter. On a dollar basis, nonperforming assets declined
approximately 15% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. The ratio of nonperforming assets to
loans plus other real estate owned also improved linked quarter and year-over-year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
The new accounting standard related to credit losses commonly known as CECL became effective January 1 and
has no impact on our 2019 results. We estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in a $1.5 billion cumulative
effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses compared with December 31, 2019, which is in line with our
previous guidance.
Slide 9 highlights fourth quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $0.90 which included several
notable items, which reduced earnings by $0.18 per share. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings
of $1.08 per share.
Slide 10 lists the notable items that affected earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019. Fourth
quarter 2019 notable items included restructuring charges, including severance and certain asset impairments,
and an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the company.
As a reminder, we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2018, including a gain on the sale
of our ATM servicing business and the sale of a majority of the company's covered loans as well as charges
related to severance, asset impairments and an accrual for certain legal matters. Along with a favorable impact of
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform, the net impact of notable items
in 2018 was an increase of $0.03 per share. My remarks through the remainder of the call will be referencing
results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018.
Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 3% year-over-year, in line
with our expectations as the impact of loan growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities was more than
offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and deposit funding mix.
Our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points versus the third quarter. About 4 basis points of the decline
was due to higher premium amortization expense in the investment securities portfolio. The remainder of the
pressure can be attributed to the yield curve compression and earning asset mix partly offset by lower deposit
costs. We expect the net interest margin to be stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter.
Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis we saw good growth in merchants
acquiring revenue driven by account and volume improvement. As expected, credit and debit card revenue
declined 1% year-over-year due to two fewer days in the fourth quarter of 2019. We look for credit and debit card
revenue to return to a mid-single-digit growth pace in 2020.
Corporate payment products revenue declined 3.1% driven by lower commercial business sales volumes.
However, in the past few weeks, sales volume growth has turned to a mid-single-digit growth rate. Trust and
investment management growth reflected business growth and favorable market conditions. Deposit service
targets were impacted by the sale of the company's ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The
decline in treasury management fees from a year ago reflected the impact of changes in earnings credits, a
residual effect of the rising rate environment in 2018. Notably, treasury management fees increased on a linked
quarter basis, reflective of the recent interest rate declines in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.
Mortgage banking revenue increased 42.7% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth.
Compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 92.3% and mortgage
application volume increased by 83.8%. Refinancing activity represented approximately [audio gap] (08:57) in the
fourth quarter of 2019 compared to about 40% in the linked quarter.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Refinancings represented 52% of applications in the fourth quarter. As of November, our digital mortgage app
was being utilized by about 86% of all mortgage applications.
Turning to slide 13, the 3.1% year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected increased personnel
expense, higher technology and communication expense, and higher net occupancy and equipment expense
reflecting actions to support business growth. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At December 31 our
common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1%.
I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent
net interest income to decline at a low-single-digit pace year-over-year, but to be relatively flat linked quarter
normalized for day count. We expect mid-single-digit growth in fee revenue year-over-year.
We expect low-single-digit growth in non-interest expenses on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality in the first
quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the fourth quarter and we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate
to be approximately 20% on a full year basis.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. We are operating in a dynamic environment and this quarter's results reflected the challenging
interest rate environment facing the entire industry as well as the impact of actions we took to better position our
company for the future. However, as our core financial metrics indicate, we ended the year on a solid note and we
are in a strong position as we head into 2020.
We view the interest rate environment as a manageable headwind and we are confident in our ability to prudently
grow our balance sheet and gain market share in our fee businesses. Fee growth was negatively impacted by
several headwinds in 2019. As Terry discussed, we expect a return to normalized growth in credit and debit card
revenue this year.
In a more stable interest rate environment, as the refi-driven market shifts to a purchase-driven market, the
investments we made in our mortgage business over the past several years will become increasingly evident in
the form of market share gains. We are proud of our strong and consistent financial track record, but we are
always looking for ways to improve. That means we are changing the way we think, the way we work, and the
way we do business.
As we move into 2020 and beyond, we will continue to increase workflow agility and speed to market for our
products and services, while at the same time optimizing our core operation to fund investment for the future. Our
ability to leverage the [ph] combined dollar (11:45) of our rapidly improving digital capabilities and our complete
payment ecosystem will lead to higher customer satisfaction, stronger revenue growth and efficiencies and,
ultimately, improved returns.
In summary, we remain focused on managing this company for the long term, while delivering [audio gap] (12:03)
a pathway to the future. I'd like to thank our employees for all we accomplished this year supported by their hard
work and commitment to creating value for all our customers.
We will now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Go
ahead, please. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Just want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage expectation. I mean, we got your comments around the
quarter. But for full year 2020, I know you had previously indicated that it could be a challenge to attain positive
operating leverage for the full year given the rate backdrop, et cetera. I wanted to get your updated thoughts on
that, if you see that there is a chance you could see positive operating leverage. And what type of magnitude
could you see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. John, thanks. And as a reminder, we had a goal of achieving positive operating leverage in 2019, and we
did that on a core basis for the full year. When we think about 2020, our objective is to target positive operating
leverage and we expect our expense growth to continue to remain in those low-single digits.
So, I think we have a number of levers that we continue to look at and pull in terms of optimization, continue with
our physical assets, optimization of the branch system, our back office activities and a number of different things.
So that's our goal. That's our objective at this particular point in time.
Now that said, as you said in your question, 2020 is a more difficult year simply because of the revenue outlook.
And I think part of being able to achieve it is going to be really based upon what happens with respect to interest
rates, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Great, thanks. And then in terms of some of the headwinds that had impacted your fee progression, I know
there was the accounting change that impacted, as well as a couple other items. Can you just talk about where do
you expect underlying momentum to build in the fee businesses as you look at 2020?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, when we end up looking at fee income, I think there's a number of different things that we end up
looking at. I think the credit card revenue is stronger, again mid-single digits as we think about next year. And that
particular line item was impacted by both an accounting item in 2018 as well as a pretty slow first quarter which
we had talked about.
I think merchant acquiring continues to accelerate and get strong and we expect mid-single digits there and then
the CPS revenue. While we saw a decline in the fourth quarter because of a little slower commercial spending,
that has come back in the first several weeks of the year, and so our expectation in that category is kind of mid-
single digits as well.
Deposit service charges has been a drag this year because of the sale of the ATM business in 2018, so that kind
of normalized or is at least flat in 2020. I think treasury management revenue is another area that we would
expect. It's kind of hit an inflection point. So while it's down on a year-over-year basis, it is up on a linked quarter
basis, and we would expect that to be better than [ph] 2020 (15:45).
So I think there's a number of different things. I think the offset to that is – and if you think about mortgage, and
we talked about mortgage, mortgage has been particularly strong in the last couple of quarters. But in 2019, it
was also quite a bit of a drag in the first several quarters. So, again, depending upon what happens with interest
rates, but in the current environment, I think that that continues to be a positive story. I mean, I think there's a
number of different areas.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good. Thank you. I heard you loud and clear on your expense growth. And I'm wondering though if that the
increased severance charges that we've seen could lead to a different geography in terms of expense growth?
And I guess I'm just looking back at your head count which seems to have risen sort of along coincident with the
consent order.
And I'm wondering if part of the initial statement upfront, Andy, in terms of continuing to transform the business is
trying to take some of the compensation growth that you experienced over the last three years and really putting
that back in technology. Is that sort of how we should expect the geography could change underneath that low-
single-digit expense growth that you're expecting for 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that's not an unfair description, Erika. It's not just technology but it's people and technology. But it's
optimizing the way we're doing business to continue to invest in the future. And our expense growth was higher
during the consent order period. But as you know it's been in the low-single digits the last couple of years. And a
notable, really two notable items, 2.4% year-over-year in 2019. And that includes optimization and expense
takeout while at the same time investing in technology and people for the future. And I would expect that to
continue into 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And I guess I'm wondering if our takeaway from that is because that seems like it's behind you and again it feels
like the severance charges are setting up for further optimization and rationalization that when you're accelerating
the amount of dollars that you're putting into the future so to speak, whether it's head count-related to that or
technology itself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, I think that that's a fair comment, Erika. And again I think the shift is optimizing what I would call the
back office and the branch network which are being impacted by customer behaviors as we transition to more of a
digital environment. But at the same time we're reinvesting that in technology spend to support those in that digital
transformation. And so, maybe a little bit of a shift from compensation to technology type of costs. But our
expectation when we think about 2020 is to continue to make the investments in the business that we have been
making over the last couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. And just one more if I could squeeze it in. Deposit costs were down 15 basis points quarter-over-
quarter. And I'm wondering underneath the 1Q NII outlook will you expect for a deposit cost trend for the first
quarter? And also, if the curve outlook continues to be stable from here, could net interest margin for the rest of
the year stabilize or potentially increase from 1Q levels?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Yeah. Well certainly if the rate environment continues where it is today, our expectation is that 2020 net interest
margin would be pretty flat to the fourth quarter, with some possible positive bias depending upon what happens
on the long end of the curve.
But that's kind of our thought process. And the reason for that is the premium amortization that we've experienced
in the third and fourth quarter is stabilizing at this particular point in time. When we think about deposit cost,
deposit price, we have been pretty responsive on the institutional deposits in terms of bringing those – repricing
those down as rates have come down. And I think from here on out deposit pricing will be a function of both
competition and what happens on the short end of the curve.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you might be able to offer any just top
level comments on the overall kind of pace of loan growth and overall demand. If you look at the HA data, it's
definitely been held up or supported by the Consumer side. But it's been a little surprising to see the slowdown in
growth on the Commercial side, however. So, I'm just curious given the breadth of your guys' franchise and
different types of customers you look at, what you're seeing at a very top level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, at a very high level again I think economically we feel pretty optimistic in terms of what the outlook
there is. If you end up looking at the components of loan growth, I think we saw a pretty strong and good growth
with respect to consumer lending. The area that was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter was really our C&I or
our corporate sort of lending.
And that's principally while we saw production and the pipeline continuing to be reasonably strong, we saw pretty
significant paydowns that were taking place in that space driven by capital markets activities and that's a function
of the long end of the curve coming down in the third and probably fourth quarter. With that stabilizing, while we
would expect some of the paydowns to continue into the first quarter, I think that will moderate.

Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then just any additional updates on ramification from the LCR rules. I think you

thinking about that dynamic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. That's in the ballpark in terms of the amount of what the impact is with respect to LCR. We're continuing to
look at different alternatives. And part of it is thinking about extending duration a little bit, possibly investing a little
bit more in agency mortgage-backed securities which would provide a little bit better yield. But I think it will be on
the margin and it won't be anything dramatic.

Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jennifer
Thompson for closing remarks. Oh, it looks like we did get one question. We do have a question from the line of
Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan Chase. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. Just wanted to clarify on credit/debit card fees, what was the impact from two
fewer processing days? What does that do? And is there a reversal in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, good question. There was an impact of two days that ended up really taking our fee income from kind of
that low- to middle-single digits to the negative 1% in the fourth quarter. There is one extra day in 2020 relative to
2019. But let me just kind of dissect it a little bit because I think that that is maybe helpful.
When you end up looking at the growth rate for 2019, it was really impacted by three different things. One is that
there was an accounting change that occurred in the first quarter of 2018 that because of the lapping effect ended
up depressing growth rates in 2019. In addition, if you remember, the consumer spend level in the first quarter
was significantly lower and it's kind of at an unusually low level. And, of course, as concerns around the economy
stabilize, that consumer spends come up. That has been in the mid-single digits in the second, third and kind of
fourth quarter in terms of sales volumes.
And then as you know, getting back to the processing days, quarterly results can be lumpy. But when we think
about 2020 in terms of – on a full year basis, we really think that mid-single digits is a good target for us and a
good estimate for us. Our sales volumes over the last several quarters have been kind of in that range. And when
you think about it on a day adjusted basis, it's been pretty consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So in 2020, there's
one more day and that will help a little bit, but mid-single digits for 2020, I think, is a good estimate. Again,
quarterly results will be a little bit lumpy. But when we think about the year, that's kind of how we're thinking about
it.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And when I look back over the prior couple of years, you'd had – this line item was growing at sort of more like 9%
to 9.5% when you look at 2017 to 2018. Has there been – going to the mid-single digits, has there been any
reduction in pricing, a shift in the kind of contracts or is this higher rewards expense? What, Terry, is driving that
slowdown from that high-single-digit level to the mid-single-digit run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. The growth rates in 2017-2018 were influenced in some respect because of some portfolios that we were
acquiring during that particular timeframe more so than other factors. And so when we think about pricing, there
hasn't been a lot of compression with respect to price. And we feel pretty good about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And rewards have been relatively flat, actually that has been a factor. So that mid-single-digit number is a good
way to think about the next 12 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And as you think about in terms of other fee revenues, Andy, you said – and Terry, treasury management
should be good. Corporate card fees, when I look at that, that was also a little bit softer this quarter. It's actually
down year-on-year. Any color on that? Because I know that the – yeah, Andy, and I'll just let you answer that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes, Vivek. The impact of that is because we saw in the last half of the fourth quarter corporate spend activity
slow. That had been running in the mid single-digits a little bit higher in the first few quarters, fourth quarter saw a
slowdown to almost flat. And as Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks, we did see a pickup in the first two
weeks of January back to the mid-single digits. So that was [ph] attributable (26:57), less slowdown, but it seems
to have come back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And I think that one of the reasons for that is if you think about where the yield curve, about how rates were
moving, there was concerns about recession. People were uncertain with respect to economic data. And then you
had the hangover of tariffs. I think the sentiment on a corporate side appears to be looking better. We're going to
be signing a trade agreement with China today I believe in terms of Phase I and the U.S., Mexico, Canada
agreement is well on its way. So I think that some of that uncertainty that might have been impacting discretionary
spend in the commercial side of the equation has been alleviated. So we feel pretty good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

Yeah. We've talked about, certainly day one and day two as part of Investor Day. The provision will increase. We
think that in terms of loan growth providing basically at kind of that 2% level versus 1.5% is kind of how we're
thinking about it. But there's going to be more volatility related to CECL. And I think one of the things we'll end up
looking at is just what is the stability in the overall portfolio and what our net charge-offs doing on a quarter-to-
quarter basis.

Operator: And we do have other question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead please, your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi, everyone. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Amanda, how are you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. I think it's understood that 2020 will likely be an aberration versus the long-term trend that you set
out at Investor Day related to revenue growth headwind but that you'll still strive to achieve positive operating
leverage in 2020. But I'm wondering how negative could negative operating leverage be in 2020 before you do
take actions related to slowing the pace of investment spend or creating more sales?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So as Terry mentioned again and earlier, we expect and target positive operating leverage for 2020. We have a
number of levers that we can continue to pull to optimize the current organization structure to continue to invest in
the future. So, Amanda, the way we think about it is a balance of optimizing today and investing in the future while
always targeting net positive operating leverage and that's how we're managing the company.

Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then, can you guys talk about the capability adds of Sage Pay and how you see your bank's
position evolving in the e-commerce payments arena over the medium term? Thanks.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. We're very excited about Sage Pay. It is a kind of leader in the e-commerce space within the U.K. and
Ireland. And we also have the opportunity to be able to extend that into the rest of Europe. We have a pretty big
footprint across Europe. So, pretty excited about that as we think about next year, we ended up rolling out sort of
similar e-commerce capabilities over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months here domestically. And so we
believe that that gives us more capabilities in terms of being able to take advantage of e-commerce in the future.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous. Go ahead, please. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey, guys, sorry I jumped on a little bit late. Did you give an update on the Charlotte expansion, Andy? And how
that's going and whether you're kind of targeting new areas for this year to expand on the retail side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John. Charlotte's going well. We opened the branch about three months ago. We've had new
customer acquisition growth in current customers, employees are fired up, we are targeting a number of new
branches to be opening, yeah, this year and still targeting that number of 10. We're learning a lot from that
investment. We continue to track that and measure our activity. And I would expect us to continue to expand in
new markets, but our first focus is expanding to our target number in Charlotte.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got you. Okay. And then, Terry, just a couple of clean-up things on NII, I think you mentioned the amortization
kind of stabilizes early this year. Is that right? And then the roll-off rates like where the tenure is today, are those
kind of breakeven or slightly accretable where you're putting new money to work in the bond portfolio today
relative to what's rolling off?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Yes. So addressing kind of your second question first, the reinvestment with respect to securities is still about 15
basis points or so accretive. So, and we would expect that based upon where rates are today the premium
amortization does stabilize in the first quarter. And so when we think about net interest margin for the year, we
think it's going to be relatively flat, maybe a little bit of positive bias relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. So the down NII for the year is just the tough comps of where you started last year, I guess, ride things
from a sequential standpoint though it feels relatively stable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
