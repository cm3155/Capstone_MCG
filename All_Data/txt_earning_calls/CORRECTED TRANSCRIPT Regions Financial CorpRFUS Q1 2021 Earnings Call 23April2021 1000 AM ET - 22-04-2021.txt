MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name
is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines
have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator

I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.

Executive Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions' first quarter 2021 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level
commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer,
are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials,
prepared comments, and Q&A.
I will now turn the call over to John.

John M. Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. We kicked off 2021 on a solid note. Earlier this
morning, we reported earnings of $614 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.63. Our ability to continue to
deliver value this quarter is a testament to both the investments we've made as well as our associates'
unwavering commitment to our customers and communities.
Our credit metrics continued to improve and reflect the good work we've done with our clients, coupled with the
expected benefits from government stimulus. Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving
economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs while still
maintaining one of the strongest allowance-to-loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%.
Although we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, our ongoing conversations with customers reflect
optimism about further economic recovery and growth. Vaccine distribution is improving in our footprint and
businesses, for the most part, had reopened. The majority of our largest deposit states are experiencing
unemployment rates significantly below those of the US as a whole, and our loan pipelines are improving as we
are seeing more activity in the marketplace. We're increasingly optimistic this momentum will continue.
Throughout this recovery and beyond, we will maintain our focus on deepening relationships with our customers
by providing personalized financial guidance combined with excellent technology solutions that continue to make
banking easier.
Now, David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the
prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter.
However, balances remain negatively impacted by excess liquidity in the market resulting in historically low
utilization levels. As of quarter end, commercial line utilization was 39% compared to our historical average of
45%. Just a reminder, each 1% of line utilization equates to approximately $600 million of loan growth.
Commercial loan balances continue to be impacted by the company's ongoing portfolio management activities
and PPP forgiveness timing. Average consumer loans again reflect a strong mortgage production, offset by runoff
portfolios. Overall, we expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low-single-digits
compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low-single-digits.
With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels, led by growth in the
consumer segment, reflecting recent government stimulus payments. The increase is primarily due to higher
account balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit
balances will continue to increase, particularly as recent stimulus is fully disbursed and corporate customers
maintain higher cash levels.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest
income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1% excluding the impact from day count and PPP. PPP related NII
declined $14 million from the prior quarter as the benefits from round two were offset by slower round one
forgiveness. Two fewer days also reduced NII by $12 million. The decline in core NII stems mostly from lower
loan balances and remixing out of higher-yielding loan categories.
Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%. Cash averaged over $16 billion during the quarter, and
when combined with PPP, reduced first quarter margin by 38 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our
normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management,
despite a near-zero short-term rate environment. Similar to prior quarters, the impact from historically low long-
term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs, and higher average
notional values of active loan hedges.
Cash management, mostly in the form of a December long-term debt call, contributed $6 million and 1 basis point
of margin. Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 2 basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points, contributing $4 million
and 1 basis point of margin. Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin. Higher
average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter.
At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter until the
hedges begin to mature in 2023. Within the quarter, we've repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps
and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024. While there may be additional adjustments in the future, we
believe the resulting profile allows us to support our goal of consistent sustainable growth.
Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve and increases in short-term interest
rates in the future while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed is on hold longer than the market currently
expects. A potential for loan growth only enhances our participation in a recovering economy. Looking ahead to
the second quarter, we expect NII excluding cash and PPP to be relatively stable.
While recent curve steepening has helped asset reinvestment levels, long-term rates will remain a modest near-
term headwind. Deposit cost reductions, one additional day, and hedging benefits will support NII in the quarter,
while loan balances are expected to remain relatively stable. Over the second half of the year and beyond, a

strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates, and the potential for balance sheet growth are
expected to ultimately drive growth in NII.
Now, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the prior
quarter, but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. Capital markets delivered another
strong quarter as customers continued to respond to interest rate changes and potential regulatory and tax
headwinds. Fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and securities
underwriting both achieved record levels, and M&A advisory services also delivered solid results. While we expect
capital markets revenue to remain solid over the remainder of the year, some activity was pulled forward. Looking
ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on
average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA.
Mortgage delivered another strong quarter as we continue to focus on growing market share and improving our
customer experience. Mortgage income increased 20% over the prior quarter, driven primarily by agency gain on
sale and favorable MSR valuation. Production for the quarter was up 89% over the prior year, setting the stage for
another strong year of mortgage income. Service charges were negatively impacted by both seasonal declines
and increased deposit balances. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer
benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges
below pre-pandemic levels.
Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate
2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. Card
and ATM fees have recovered, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased debit card
spend. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020 combined with exceptionally strong fee income
performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year, but this will
be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness and loan growth.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by
lower incentive compensation, primarily related to capital markets and mortgage, which was partially offset by a
seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Of note, base salaries were 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter as we
remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate head count decreased 2% quarter-over-
quarter and 4% year-over-year, and excluding the impact of our Ascentium Capital acquisition that closed April 1,
2020, head count was down 6%.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products, and people to grow our
business. In 2021, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to remain stable compared to 2020 with quarterly
adjusted non-interest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And while we face uncertainty regarding
the pace of economic recovery, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time.
From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net
charge-offs were 40 basis points, a 3-basis-point improvement over the prior quarter reflecting broad-based
improvement across most portfolios. Non-performing loans, total delinquencies, business services criticized loans
all declined modestly. Our allowance for credit losses declined 25 basis points to 2.44% of total loans and 280%
of total non-accrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.57%. The decline in the
allowance reflects charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in our economic outlook, and improved credit
performance, including the impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill approved in March.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
The allowance reduction resulted in a net $142 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains one of the
highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal
Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect
to the path of the economic recovery. As we look forward, we are cautiously optimistic regarding our credit
performance for the year. While net charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, based on current expectations,
we believe the peak is behind us and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 to 50 basis points.
With respect to capital, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated
10.3% this quarter. As you are aware, the Federal Reserve extended their restrictions on capital distributions
through the second quarter of 2021. The Federal Reserve also indicated these restrictions are expected to be
lifted beginning in the third quarter, subject to capital remaining above required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR
cycle for firms participating.
We have opted into this year's CCAR, and assuming capital levels remain above required levels and the Fed's
Stress Test, we should be back to managing capital distributions against the SCB requirements beginning in the
third quarter. However, our plan is to begin share repurchases in the second quarter, subject to the Fed's
earnings-based restrictions. Based on our internal stress testing framework and amount of capital we need to run
our business, we are updating our operating range for Common Equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75% with the goal of
managing to the midpoint over time.
So, wrapping up on the next slide, our 2021 expectations which we have already addressed. In summary, we feel
really good about our first quarter results and anticipate carrying the momentum into the remainder of 2021. Pre-
tax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit quality is outperforming
expectations, capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the prospects for the economic recovery
to continue in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken
Usdin of Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ken?

Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Sorry, guys. Is that open to me, Ken Usdin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A

Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Oh, my bad. Sorry. I thought I lost you for a second. Thank you. Yeah. David, just wondering, you made the
points clearly about starting to reposition that longer-term swaps portfolio and to position for potentially higher
rates. How are you – how do you help us think about how that changes the longer-term trajectory of recognized
income versus just the hope that rates go the right way and loans are better, presuming the economic recovery?
And in terms of just how you make future decisions on future – on other potential terminations? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Ken, we never anticipated for all the derivatives to go to term. We wanted protection and our goal is not
to turn the derivatives into a trading asset, but to have it help us manage the volatility of NII and that's worked
extremely well for us. As we think about the future, we obviously look at all the data points to try and figure out
when the Fed may move. And as we continue to have economic progress, we're thinking that there is more
likelihood of an increase in short rates and probably loan rates to follow, starting in the back half of 2022 and into
2023 and 2024. We wanted to participate in that and not have our NII being muted. So, we terminated the $4.3
billion worth of derivatives. You take whatever gain you have and you have to spread that over the life, you don't
get a onetime gain. So, we will continue to evaluate the economic recovery and we'll make adjustments as we go

along. We still have protection though for 2021 and 2022, no change there. It's just out the curve – I mean out the
term a little bit in terms of really 2023 and 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. And along the way, obviously, you're still sitting on this big excess cash position as you showed to us
in your core NIM. Can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about staging incremental use of that cash
versus the hopes for loan growth that you and the rest of the industry are hoping for anticipating?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We – like many folks, we had a nice deposit growth. We've had $16 billion of average cash at the Fed, $23
billion at the end of the quarter. We constantly challenge ourselves, Ken, on whether or not put that to work in the
securities book when – of course, we want to make all the good quality loans we can, that's been elusive for the
industry thus far. And so, some have deployed that in the securities book, we've done a little bit, but we're
reluctant because, I was talking to our Treasurer yesterday, there's no free lunch here, you just can't – you can't
hide from the risk that you take, if you try to take duration risk right now and deploy in that in the securities book. It
will help you short-term in NII, but you will pay for that dearly down the road and we're playing the long game.
We're not about trying to generate short-term NII growth for that sake. So, that being said, we are challenging
ourselves, and as we make different decisions to get that deployed, you should not expect wholesale investment
in the securities book, but you may see some around the edges.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. So, maybe to dig in a little bit on revenues, you're off to a nice start to the year, I think
revenues are up over 9% year-over-year with both NII and fees up. So, can you just maybe talk through the
revenue outlook a bit and where could there be sources of upside just given the fact that the guide implies a pretty
strong deceleration from the first quarter and it looks like mortgage and capital markets could remain strong?
And then, second, it just seems like PPP is one of the potential swing factors. Can you maybe just help us
understand what are you assuming for balances and forgiveness for the rest of the year? And then, I have a
follow-up.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Okay. So, to start with the top of the house, so our guide on total adjusted revenues is down modestly, obviously,
continued to have pressure and reinvestment of fixed rate assets throughout the year. We do have some,
obviously, protection on NII through our hedging program, so we're excited about that. From a loan growth
standpoint, we are in some great markets, so we expect to benefit over time as our economies continue to open
and we get some loan growth. We have some headwinds in terms of – again, we continue to have capital markets
at $100 million every quarter, we guided you to $55 million to $65 million, so who knows, I mean, if we continue to
have capital markets should be robust, M&A should be robust, and we might be able to outperform there, but we
gave you the guide of $55 million to $65 million.
We think mortgage will continue to be strong. Our teams are performing very well in terms of mortgage and we
think there could be some upside there, but who knows. We have to see what happens with the rate environment.
I think in terms of PPP, we have $4.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We originated $1.5 billion under the PPP2
program and we forgave about $700 million in the first quarter. The timing of that forgiveness is a big determinant,
right, in terms of ultimate income for us. We think that's back-end loaded and literally in the fourth quarter before
you start seeing real forgiveness. As a matter of fact, we'll have a little bit of pressure on PPP-generated revenue
in – from first to second quarter as we disclosed a little bit and that's only because of timing. The point is, if you
got $4.3 billion, the fees and interest we earn off, that's a little over 3%. It's just timing, when is it coming in, and
your guess is as good as ours on that, but that will be – that's a pretty big swing factor in terms of where we end
up on our guide on revenue for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, in terms of capital, you just announced the 9.25% to 9.75%. Yeah. You put out a release
the other day announcing a $2.5 billion buyback. And if I look at market expectations for earnings, it implies a
pretty steep decline in the capital level. So, can you maybe just talk about expectations for utilizing the buyback,
assuming the Fed continues to ease restrictions? And where do you see you actually running with the cap story? I
heard you said to run in the middle, but given that we're entering a period of strong economic growth, potential for
rates rising at some point in time, could we move towards the lower end of that over time? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, so we had – our last goal was closer to 10%. We changed our operating range to 9.25% to 9.75% and said
we'd operate in the middle over time. That range can change as economic conditions continue to improve and we
still have uncertainty out there. So, we believe that's an appropriate range and an appropriate midpoint of that at
9.50% is the right place for Regions at this time. As conditions get better, we can adjust accordingly, or if they get
worse, we'll adjust that way. We're at 10.3% today, so that's 80 basis points from the middle, round numbers,
that's $800 million worth of capital. We'll continue to – we didn't have buybacks in the first quarter. As I mentioned,
we will have some in the second quarter.
But let's go back and remember, our capital, we want to use to grow our business. That's its priority. We'd love to
have more loan growth out there and use it that way. We're going to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% of our
income, so that we have a sustainable dividend. We like to use that capital for nonbank acquisitions like we did on
Ascentium Capital is a good example. So, that's our preference. We will then – the last effort we will use buybacks
to maintain and optimize our capital at that 9.5% Common Equity Tier 1. So, we'll be restricted on how much we
get to do in the second quarter. We think we'll have a very good CCAR submission which gives us more flexibility
to manage that to that 9.5% starting in the third quarter and you should expect us to get there and fairly quickly.

Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
David, can you touch on – you gave us some good color on the loan loss reserves and I know we've talked about
this in the past about your day one reserves back in January of 2020. What's the likelihood that you guys could
get to that level or maybe even something less if the economy is even better going forward, let's say, 18 months
from now than it was back on January 1, 2020, and the mix of business is less risky than possibly was back then
as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, you kind of answered your own question there I think, Gerard, and that is you're exactly right. We're sitting
here today at 2.44% coverage or 2.57% if you exclude PPP. Our day one was 1.71% and that's more akin to the
2.44%, by the way. And so, the question is, when can you get back to there? And I would just say we really don't
think of it as back to there. We think of what's the appropriate reserve we need to have based on the risk inherent
in our portfolio. That can change based on your profile and to the extent the profile is better than it was that
January when we adopted, if the environment that we expect through the whole life of the loan is better, then the
reserves can go below that. But it's all dependent on what the facts and circumstances are at each balance sheet
day.
And so, we see the economy getting better. As we've mentioned, it's better, faster than we thought. We're still
cautiously optimistic about where this goes. We need to get the vaccine out, we need the economies to continue
to open, and if all that happens, you would expect reserves to come down. But right now, we can only take it – we
can only adjust reserves based on what we see today. If next quarter it's better, then you would expect it to come
down. So, there's no magic in that day one. That day one was based on the facts and circumstances that existed
at January, and if they're better, then you would expect reserves to be lower. If it's worse, you would expect them
to be higher.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. You gave us some good color on the hedging program in both your prepared remarks and
answering an earlier question. On the $100 million that you're generating currently at the present time, how could
that number – or what interest rate environment would you need to see, to see that $100 million maybe get to
$120 million or vice versa or fall to $80 million? Can you give us some color about that particular amount and how
it's impacted by rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, clearly, the – so, we're receiving fixed swaps and we have floor. So, you earn more to the extent rates are
lower than where we are today, and that's pegged off of LIBOR. So, LIBOR, it's pretty [ph] doggone (28:07) low.
So, you would have to see that go to almost zero. We don't have any new derivatives where we begin the
notional. We had some this first quarter a little bit. I think really as you think about – hello? Are we still there?

It wasn't meant to help us increase NII. It was to keep us protected in case we had an extraordinarily low rate
environment like we do. So, being able to have $100 million to $103 million, $105 million each quarter is really
what it's about, not trying to get it to be $120 million and $130 million.

wondering if you can assure investors on how you've been able to keep expense growth at these low levels and
invest back in the company. In other words, is there going to be a potential surprise with regards to expense
growth going forward, especially as we look forward to a stronger revenue growth environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
No. No surprises, Erika. We, as you know, announced an initiative now a couple years ago, we characterize to
Simplify and Grow. We talk now about it as being about continuous improvement. It was largely designed as a
way to focus on how we simplify our business, how we flatten the organizational structure, reduce expenses to
make investments in people, in technology, and additional capabilities and products. And I think we've
successfully done that, to your point, we've been able to keep expenses generally flat while providing increased
compensation every year for the teams that remain with us, investing significantly in our business, hiring
additional bankers and other associates who are working actively in our technology function and risk
management, other parts of our business, and we'll continue to do that.
David mentioned this morning we're committed to holding expenses essentially flat. There may be some
increases from time to time if revenue rises, and that revenue is associated with a variable compensation, like
capital markets, like mortgage. But otherwise, our core run rate of expenses should be flat and we believe that we
can continue to make investments in our business while holding those expenses flat.

David J. Turner, Jr. A

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. And, David, second question is for you. I'm guessing that you opted in to the 2021 CCAR to
optimize your stress capital buffer lower. What can you do to be able to better direct the results closer to 2.5%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, if you were to look at the resubmission that we had in December, you would have seen our degradation
there would have put us underneath the floor of 2.5%. We ran our model based on the assumptions, the CCAR
assumptions in the first quarter. We believe the results will again show that we will be underneath the floor of
2.5%. So, part of the reason we wanted to participate is because of that.
The other part of it is our credit has continued to improve pretty dramatically, even relative to our peers, and this
gives us an opportunity to show you and the rest of the world that our credit has continued to improve as a result
of our derisking strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We feel very good about that. This gives an opportunity
for an independent third party, in this case, the Federal Reserve, to show everybody what our losses are relative
to peer. So, we're excited about participating. We think it will show well. We feel very good about our credit as
we've mentioned in the call, and we have robust reserves and capital levels on top of that. So, we're well
positioned and I think this can help us from a credit rating agency as well.

Operator: Your next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew D. O’Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Just a clarification on the expenses, for the full year, obviously, it implies a drop down for the
rest of the year. Is that just lower incentive comp related to capital markets and mortgage revenues or are there
any other drivers as we think about the drop down from 1Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, it's that, but it's also as John mentioned, our continuous improvement program which is – we're
focused on this every day. And so, we continue to make adjustments in leveraging technology and processes and
talked about head count, that's part of how the head count is down as we're leveraging technology. So, we just
have an intense focus on, one, making appropriate investments to grow our business. That's number one. We
have to figure out how to pay for that, so we can keep our expenses relatively flat. So, every part of the
organization is focused on expense control, so that we can make that investment. And I think you're going to see
our expenses, as I mentioned, should come down to that $880 million to $890 million for the remainder of the
year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew D. O’Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, separately as we think about loan growth picking up exiting the year, obviously, there's the PPP
running off and the exit portfolios, but what do you think will be the drivers of growth for you guys, I think, this year
and into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, this is John. Our customers are increasingly optimistic about the economy. We operate in some – as
David said, some really good markets and most of the states that we operate in were some of the first to reopen
their economies. As a result, unemployment rates in states like Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida are better
than national average. And so, we see businesses expanding. Our pipelines today are 50% larger than they were
this time last year, and that is broad-based across geography and sectors. We expect to see growth as
companies work through the excess liquidity they're holding, begin to rebuild inventories, make investments in
property, plant, and equipment as their businesses expand. So, I think there is opportunity to grow. The question
will be the timing of that.
And as David mentioned, we are experiencing historically low levels of line utilization. We expect our customers
will get back into their lines of credit once they work through the excess liquidity that they're holding. You just don't
know what the timing of that will be. It's largely a function of, obviously, economic growth. We're confident that as
the economy expands, we will grow loans. Separately, I think we'll continue to see good mortgage production on

the consumer side and we've got some other initiatives underway related to consumer lending that we think could
have an impact as well.
And finally, we're a small business, we're very pleased with our acquisition of Ascentium Capital, we think that
equipment finance is an important part of potential growth, particularly in late-2021 and 2022. And so, believe all
those things can be drivers of some loan growth to offset, to your point, the headwinds we face with PPP and
some of the exit portfolios.

John M. Turner A

Good morning. Back to the capital discussion, I know you had indicated in terms of capital deployment, potential
M&A interest on the nonbank side. Wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on what areas on the nonbank
side you will consider deals. And then, separately, if you could just talk about potential interest in whole bank
deals, clearly, we've seen a fair amount of activity in the Southeast and a lot of banks moving towards bulking up
on scale. So, just want to get your updated thoughts there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Okay. Well, with respect to nonbank, we've been active over the last several years acquiring capabilities in
capital markets, low-income housing, tax credits, capabilities, equipment finance, obviously, with Ascentium
Capital, in wealth management, Highland Associates or Highland Capital in the mortgage business, mortgage
servicing rights, all those things reflect the kinds of interest that we still have. So, to the extent we can acquire
portfolios, acquire capabilities that we think will allow us to provide additional services to customers to grow and
diversify our revenue, we're active and interested and we'll continue to be.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
With respect to bank M&A, our views still hasn't changed. We think we have a very solid plan. We want to
continue to execute that plan. We believe if we do that, we can deliver real value for our shareholders. We'll see
the benefits in our stock price and the strengthening currency. And so, we're watching the activity that's occurring.
We're evaluating it, trying to learn from it. But our focus is on executing our plans in the markets that we operate
in and we think there is a lot of value creation associated with that for our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, great. Thanks, John. And then, my second question is around operating efficiency. I know you indicated
that your goal is to continue to produce positive operating leverage over time. Your adjusted operating efficiency
ratio came in around 56.8% this quarter. Where do you see that going for the full year 2021 and maybe beyond
that? Interested in what your thoughts are for 2022. Where is a fair level where that could reach and what's a
good run rate? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, you're right, we stay focused on generating positive operating leverage over time. We do that by both
growing the revenue and because of the investments that we're making and watching our costs. We feel good
about where we are with our efficiency ratio, especially compared to our peer group. Obviously, that gets more
challenging as the year goes, as the low interest rate environment and the reinvestment risk puts more pressure
on revenue.
You asked about 2022, I haven't gotten to 2022 yet, but if you think about the industry, I think we've got all work
towards getting underneath that 55% in time and lower, but you can't do that until you get kind of normalized
environment where you have normalized revenue, and if you did that, being under 55% is going to be I think
expected. So, in the interim, you get as efficient as you can, but you still have to make the investments to grow
revenue and that's what we're doing. So, we've got a number of initiatives in our continuous improvement
program that will continue to help us from the cost standpoint, and hopefully, those continuous improvement
efforts also help us grow revenue. So, I know I didn't give you a specific point, John, but we'll continue to work to
get that number down over time.

comfortable with shifting more of that excess cash into the securities book over time? And it sounds like you don't
have much of that at all in your NII or revenue guide at this point, is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That's right. We've said around the edges, we may deploy some of our excess cash. If you go into your general
mortgage-backed day, you may pick up 130 basis points. We're still having pressure on the front book, back book
of about 40 basis points between loans and securities. So, that's what weighs on us. We really need to see that
10-year getting to [ph] 2%-plus too (00:42:27) and kind of stay there and feel convicted on that before we take the
duration risk, because we just don't want to. Again, we don't want to make a short-term play for NII and feel bad
about that six months from now, because rates got away from us, and I think we're all seeing the economy
improve, but the pace of that we can debate and where that should come a higher rate environment over time.
So, in the interim, we're just going to be cautious. We may pick, like I said, a little bit of our excess cash and put it
to work, but you should not expect wholesale changes through an investment in the securities book at this time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. Okay, great. Appreciate the color there. And then, for whatever reason, you don't end up seeing the loan
growth pan out as you expect in 2Q and maybe even into the back half of the year and the cash continues to
build, can you just talk about how that situation might impact that investment strategy if at all, and then what are
the steps you could take to offset some of that lost revenue? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We continue to, as John mentioned, looking for portfolios and things to really put not only our capital to
work, but put our liquidity to work, too, to the extent that deposits continue to come in at the pace they are, one,
it'd be surprising, because the growth that we saw primarily this quarter in consumer came from the $1.9 trillion
stimulus program that we got in the quarter. So, I don't think we'll continue to see it grow at that pace. But to the
extent that it does and we end up our $23 billion into Fed grows materially from that, then we may make different
decisions. But I don't think that's a very high probability, we'd much rather again find loan growth by portfolios and
put a little bit of it to work in the securities book.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the deposit growth. What I thought was interesting was all the growth
came from consumer, and the commercial side was down a little. And do you think that could be an indicator that
16


Regions Financial Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
maybe in the second quarter, you start to see commercial deposits coming down and maybe you get that line
draw that you're looking for in the second half of the year as the indicator?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Peter, I think in the second quarter to see that all of a sudden happen, I don't know, we talk to our customers one-
on-one, we believe over time that they're going to probably maintain more liquidity today than they did pre-
pandemic. We'll see when we get there, but that's what we're hearing. I think the consumer growth you saw,
again, it was based on the stimulus that hit during the quarter. So, I don't expect it to have that kind of growth
every quarter, although we're growing customer accounts, too, and we're very pleased about new customer
acquisition.
On the business front, in terms of second quarter growth though, I think it's more pushed to the second half of the
year as these balances get worked through, their liquidity gets worked through, and as John mentioned, we're in
very good markets. We're excited about the growth potential here. So, it's just a matter of time before we see the
loan growth. I just don't think you're going hit that breakthrough in the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just on the premium amortization expense, it was stable quarter-to-quarter at $50 million. If the
10-year were to increase closer to about 2% level, where does premium amortization expense go down to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think if we were to be that high, we're probably down $5 million, maybe $10 million-ish, somewhere there
in there.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Yeah. I think if our view out over the next three years, that's our strategic planning horizon, was that we couldn't
continue to deliver improving returns for our shareholders, that we weren't going to perform relative to our peers
well, then I think we would have to consider a variety of alternatives. But today, when we think we see a path to
continue to grow revenue, we believe we can continue to make meaningful investments in our business while
holding our expenses relatively flat. And we think all that is a path to generating nice returns for our shareholders.
And so, our perspective is unchanged, but to your question, it's possible, and that's why we continue to follow the
market, try to understand what others are doing and how transactions get structured. So, we're not totally – it's not
as if we're not paying attention, I guess, would be my point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Second question is on credits. Just can you give us some color on how your more COVID-sensitive
borrowers are doing now [indiscernible] (00:48:23-00:48:31)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Again, in the markets that we operate in, those economies are open and people are beginning to move
around. There's a lot of pent-up demand. And as a result, we see hospitality sector, whether it be restaurants or
hotels continuing to – their performance continuing to improve. Probably the biggest challenge they face is
workforce and hiring people to work. Heard a number of stories sort of anecdotally over the last two-plus weeks
about restaurant service being slow in so many places because restaurant owners are having difficulty bringing in
their workforce back. But people are getting out and there's I think significant indicators that people are going to
be traveling a lot this summer.
And so, again, thinking about the markets we operate in, that bodes well for those economies. The energy sector
is doing better for sure. So, all in all, credit continues to improve, and based upon what we know today, we'd
expect that trajectory to continue.

Thank you. Good morning, John and David. Can you give us an update on how Regions is thinking about the use
of its balance sheet in conjunction with partnerships with finance technology players? How important is it for
Regions to own the customer relationships versus what's your willingness to give certain parameters for the kinds
of loans that you're interested in originating to finance technology partners and letting them originate those loans
for you?
18


Regions Financial Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Very important to us to own the relationship and we have experimented with partnerships, and in every
case, what we were seeking to determine was could we leverage that partnership back into a relationship. And
where you see us beginning to exit those partnerships, it is because we awfully concluded that they weren't
relationship-building opportunities. We are looking consistently to expand our capabilities to think about how we
potentially acquire platforms that we would own that would allow us to originate credit, as an example, to
companies or individuals who hopefully could become, would become customers, and Ascentium Capital is a
great example of that.
That company had some really good technology, a platform to originate credit, made it easy for customers. We
liked it, we saw it as an opportunity to acquire the technology and the capabilities that that very experienced team
had to help us grow into the small business space to – with companies that could potentially become Regions'
depository customers, Regions' wealth management customers. And so, that's I think the way you'll see us
continue to use our balance sheet is to build relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. Separately, your rationale behind wanting to get your stress capital buffer below 2.5% makes sense
simply because of what it signals in terms of credit quality relative to your peers. But can you discuss from a
practical perspective, what the significance is given your intention is to run with around 9.5% CET1? So having
the 2.5% stress capital buffer on top of your 4.5% minimum would set your minimum capital level at 7%, but since
your intention is to run with around 9.5% anyway, is it really that big of a deal to have a little bit higher SCB?
Maybe you're looking longer term to a goal of lowering your CET1 target over time, just if you could speak to that
would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
You get the prize of the question of the day, and you're exactly right. In today's environment, the SCB for us really
doesn't come into play. Because there's no way in the world we'd have our spot capital below 7%. I think, as an
investor, most investors would have a conniption fit if we did that. So, that was just a piece of it because – but it
sends a message when your peers are all under the floor of 2.5% and you're at 3%, it kind of sends this message
that your credit quality is worse. We don't believe that and we wanted a very public opportunity to demonstrate
that. And that's really what this was all about.
So, I wouldn't say that that gives us an opportunity to run our capital lower. We think our 9.5% in the middle of our
range is the right number for us at this time based on the risk we see in our business. If over time risk changes,
the outlook changes, we might operate lower than that. But from a practical standpoint, we're not going to get
anywhere close to the 7% spot. And so, you're exactly right, it wasn't done just for that purpose.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
The only other thing I'd add is, every time we participate, we learn something, and I think it helps us continue to
develop our thinking about how we manage the risk in our business, the composition of our business, the impact
of various stress scenarios on our portfolios, all those things are constructive. And in addition to David's point, I
think it's – we have an opportunity to sort of reset and we want to do that. We believe that's appropriate.

Good morning, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just a little follow-up on that, I'm still trying to understand the board approval which, I assume,
you requested the size of the buyback that you requested, because when I run that through the model, I'm getting
to an ultimate CET1 that's below the range that you indicated today. So, is that board request a function of the
max potential that you might anticipate in an environment where the loan book is not growing or I'm just trying to
square that, the board request versus the CET1 guide versus the loan growth outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, the main driver right now would be the CET1 guide. The $2.5 billion that we – or that our board
authorized, grants us the flexibility to manage our capital as we see fit without having to go back to the board for
another authorization. So, it's going to be a function of how much we make, what's the environment look like,
what's our capital levels look like, there are whole host of things that go into that, and that was the level that we
felt comfortable that we could run with it and it gives us flexibility to manage accordingly. That's all it's about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

And what's the expiry date on that authorization?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A

Yeah. It's an open – there's not a date.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So, it's longer tailed. Okay. And then, the second question just has to do with ESG and the reason I'm
asking is that, recently, we've seen several institutions put out their 2021 plans and goals, and we all know what's
going on with regard to carbon footprint emission, goals that the global industry has or politicians, et cetera? So,
the question here has to do with, how you're thinking about your climate goals as it relates to your work with your
customers? You're in an energy-intensive footprint and I know for yourself, you've been very clear on your
20


Regions Financial Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
climate-oriented goals and how far along you are for yourself. But I'm wondering, how do you think about working
with your customers on this, is this something you would be embracing or give us a sense as to how you're
thinking about that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think about it from a couple different perspectives. One is just managing the credit risk that's in our book
today and the potential impact of climate change and transition on the industries that we bank. We're talking to
our customers. We're very aware of potential impacts. We understand the exposure we have within our portfolio.
And so, we're actively managing that. We believe that it's important that the banking industry be part of a
transition and participate in financing the transition that will occur to a more climate-friendly environment. And so,
we want to be actively participating.
We have a very good, as an example, solar capabilities and capital markets capabilities associated with solar,
and we are continuing to look for opportunities to develop capabilities that would support the transition to a more
climate-friendly environment. And so, we think that's a business opportunity. Beyond that, we have real
governance, good governance around, and we spent the last two days in board meetings talking about ESG and
our overall ESG plan. We will file our TCFD report midsummer, so that to be in compliance and I think you'll find in
our disclosures around ESG to be very broad and on point, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, I'll add to that. So, we started with our own emissions kind of in Scope 1 and then we went into the
vendors that we used and how are they thinking about ESG. We're going into customers and how they do that.
So, this is an ongoing process that we'll stay committed to getting that done over time.
I do want to clarify that I misspoke on the share repurchase. That runs through next year, through the first quarter
of next year. So, it is not open, it's basically a year.

Okay. All right. Yeah. That's why I was a little bit like confused around the messaging you were trying to send with
regard to the size of the buyback versus the CET1 range, and I guess, your messaging is, hey, we wanted max
flexibility.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Operator: Your final question is from Christopher Marinac of J Montgomery Scott.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just want to circle on the difference between your new loan yields and what was on
balance sheet this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our total loan, our front book, back book, between securities and loans is about 40 basis points. From a
loan standpoint, I think that component is pretty close, it's maybe 10 basis points, 15 basis points, a little more on
the securities book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
David, as you look at this type of environment, what causes that to narrow or change in the future? Is it something
that's possible or will it take a while?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
No, it can change. Your mix – the mix has a lot to do with it, in terms of what you're putting on versus what's
rolling off. We have different portfolios we've invested in and we see growth in our small business through our
newly acquired Ascentium Capital, does have a tendency to have higher yields that could be helpful. But we are
seeing some of our customers access the capital markets and that puts a little pressure on loan growth, and when
those clients leave, it's tough to get that replaced at the yield that we had them on. So, as the economy opens, we
think we see more activity and we think the rate environment will improve a bit commensurate with that increased
economic activity.
