MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q1 2023
Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Please

Kerri S. Bernstein
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, American Express Co.
Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion
contains forward-looking statements about the company future business and financial performance. These are
based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our
reports on file with the SEC.
This discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures
are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discuss.
All of these are posted on our website at ir.american-express.com.
We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks the company's
performance and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of
our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our first quarter earnings call. Back in
January, we laid out our guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share
growth. Our first quarter results are tracking to this full-year guidance.
Revenues were a record $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 22%, which is well above our full-year expectations.
Stronger spending growth outside the US and in T&E offset some softness in US small business spending.
EPS came in a bit higher than our original plan expectation. Our plan calls for quarterly EPS to grow sequentially
through the year as our revenue growth continues. Though, business was up 16% globally year-over-year on an
FX-adjusted basis.
T&E spending was up 39% quarter-over-quarter on an FX-adjusted basis due to grow over benefit from the
impact of the Omicron variant in last year's results. We saw strong demand across all T&E categories and
customer types.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Spending at restaurants continues to be a bright spot, with growth accelerating to 28% on an FX-adjusted basis
year-over-year. In fact, March was a record month for reservations booked through our Resy platform. The
platform now has more than 40 million users globally, an increase of 5 million in the last six months.
Consumer travel demand also remains high, with Q1 bookings through our consumer travel business reaching
their highest level since pre-pandemic.
As you'll recall, we reorganized our international business last year bringing together our consumer, small
business, and large corporate management teams outside the US to increase agility, scale and efficiency, and
accelerate our growth.
Our international issuing businesses were the fastest growing before the pandemic and we're seeing a return to
those trends. International card services billings continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 29% on FX-adjusted
basis. Results were driven by robust growth in T&E spending, which increased 58% year-over-year on an FX-
adjusted basis.
We also saw continued momentum in card acquisitions with 3.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. US
Consumer Platinum and Gold, Business Platinum and Delta co-brand account acquisitions all reached record
levels. Notably, over 70% of the new accounts acquired globally in the quarter are on fee-based products.
As we've noted for some time, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are driving our growth in billings and acquisitions
of premium fee-based products. More than 60% of consumer new accounts acquired globally came from
Millennial and Gen Z. These customers also continue to contribute the highest growth in billed business among all
age cohorts in the US, up 28% in the quarter.
On credit, our metrics remain best-in-class supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk
management capabilities, and the thoughtful underwriting actions we've taken on an ongoing basis. Our
customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower growth and higher inflation economic environment.
While the near-term economic outlook is mixed, our customers' spending and credit performance to date, along
with the continued strong demand for our products from high-quality new customers, reinforces our confidence in
our ability to achieve our long-term aspirations. Our capital, funding, and liquidity positions are strong, and we
continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty and stress.
As you know, we run our company for the long term. We have a strategy in place to deal with swings in the
economy, which has enabled us to be successful in navigating through the pandemic, the initial recovery period,
and the current environment of elevated inflation and higher interest rates. Through it all, we've continued to
attract and retain high-quality customers, and our strategic investments have resulted in the momentum we've
seen throughout last year and into 2023.
We feel good about the decisions we're making around growth, risk management, and the economic environment.
Our key metrics are strong. The market opportunities we see in our core businesses are plentiful. And our
strategy of investing in value proposition innovations, customer acquisitions, and global merchant coverage
continues to drive our growth.
Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering between 15% and 17%
revenue growth and earnings per share of between $11 and $11.40. We remain committed to focusing on

achieving our aspiration of delivering sustainable revenue growth greater than 10% and mid-teens EPS growth as
we get to a more steady-state macro environment.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which
are tracking in line to the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term
growth aspirations.
Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Our first quarter revenues were $14.3 billion, reaching a record
high for the fourth straight quarter, up 22% on an FX-adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net
income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.40.
Given we had a sizeable credit reserve release of pandemic-driven reserves in the first quarter of last year, we've
also included pre-tax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pre-tax
pre-provision income was $3.2 billion, up 20% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth
momentum in our underlying earnings.
So, now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which, in our spend-centric business model, always
begins with a look at volumes, which you see on slides 3 through 7.
Total network volumes and billed business were both up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-
adjusted basis. Given that most of our spending categories have fully recovered versus pre-pandemic levels, we
saw the more stable growth rates we expected this quarter with first quarter billed business growth of 16%, just
above last quarter's growth of 15%.
As Steve noted earlier, we did see particularly strong growth in travel and entertainment spending in Q1 of 39%
driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences. As expected, this growth rate was elevated early in
the quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in January of the prior year, so I would expect to see growth
moderate moving forward but to remain high, given the strong demand we are seeing across geographies,
customer types, and T&E categories.
We also saw solid growth in goods and services spending for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. I would note that
we did see this growth rate slow sequentially in the US for both SME and consumer as we went through the
quarter, so we are continuing to monitor these spending trends.
That said, overall billed business reached a record level in the month of March, and our largest segment, US
Consumer, grew billings 16% in the first quarter, accelerating a bit above last quarter's growth. Millennial and Gen
Z customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing 28%
year-over-year this quarter.
Turning to Commercial Services, we saw year-over-year growth of 10% overall. US SME growth came in at just
6% this quarter but was somewhat offset by really good growth in US large and global corporates, up 34% year-
over-year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
And lastly, you see our highest growth in International Card Services. We are seeing the early benefits of the
organizational changes we announced last year start to play out, demonstrated by strong growth across
geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumer and international SME and large
corporate customers, who were among our fastest growing pre-pandemic, grew 27% and 34% year-over-year,
respectively.
International Card Services travel and entertainment growth was especially robust at 58% for the quarter. This
segment is still in a recovery mode, given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments. Overall, our
spending volumes are currently tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term
aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on slide 8. We saw year-over-year growth of 25% in our
loan balances, as well as continued sequential growth. This growth continues to come mostly from our existing
customers, who are rebuilding balances, and as a result the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances is
growing faster than the 25% growth we see in total loans.
Specifically, over 70% of this growth in the US is coming from our existing customers. We are pleased with this
growth and with the overall lending economics we are generating. That said, looking forward, we may see the
growth rate of our loan balances moderate a bit as we progress through 2023, but we would expect it to remain
elevated versus pre-pandemic levels.
As you then turn to credit and provision on slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base
continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our Card Member loans and receivables write-
off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, though they did continue to move up this quarter as
we expected, which you can see on slide 9.
We view these consolidated write-off and delinquency rates as more comparable to pre-pandemic rates than the
individual loans and receivable rates because, as we talked about last quarter, our charge products in many
instances now have embedded lending functionality. Going forward, we continue to expect these delinquency and
write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide 10. The expected increases in delinquency
rates, combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances, resulted in a $320 million reserve
build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.1 billion of provision expense in the first quarter
as we moved past much of the volatility in this line item that CECL reserve builds/releases caused during the
pandemic.
As you see on slide 11, we ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of reserves representing 2.5% of our total loans
and Card Member receivables. This reserve rate remained about 40 basis points below the levels we had pre-
pandemic or day one CECL. We expect this reserve rate to continue to increase as we move through 2023 but to
remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Moving next to revenue on slide 12. Total revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the first quarter, or 23% on an
FX-adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would
note that service fees and other revenue was up 34% in the quarter, driven largely by the year-over-year
increases in travel-related revenues that accompanied the tremendous demand we've seen for travel.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
As you can see on slide 13, our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX-
adjusted basis, which, similar to spending volumes growth, is just above last quarter's growth rate. Net card fee
revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 14.
Growth, which did moderate slightly this quarter as expected from the extremely high level we saw last quarter,
remains quite strong. This growth continued driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products
as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter we acquired 3.4 million
new cards, demonstrating the demand we're seeing especially for our premium fee-based products.
Moving on to slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 36% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis,
accelerating versus last quarter primarily due to the growth in our revolving loan balances.
I'd also note that net yield on our Card Member loans increased 50 basis points sequentially, reaching pre-
pandemic levels this quarter, as our customers increased their revolving balances. We have been able to
increase our net yield while maintaining net write-off rates below pre-pandemic levels, expanding our net credit
margin.
To sum up on revenues on slide 16, we're tracking well against our expectations and looking forward, we still
expect to see revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the full year 2023.
The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. Those investments
show up across the expense lines you see on slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses,
these costs came in at 43% of total revenues in the first quarter, tracking right with our expectations for them to
run around 43% of total revenues on a full-year basis.
On the marketing line, we invested $1.3 billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to have marketing
spend that is fairly flat to our full year 2022 expense, $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so
that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenue, as we did for many years prior to the pandemic.
Moving to the bottom of slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the first quarter.
There's usually some quarterly volatility in this number and this quarter, for example, we saw a $95 million impact
from net mark-to-market losses on our Amex Ventures investment portfolio, which you can see based off our first
quarter results that, similar to marketing, we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be
around $14 billion for the full year. We continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage and,
moving forward, expect to have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth.
Turning next to capital on slide 18, we ended the first quarter with our CET1 ratio at 10.6%, within our target
range of 10% to 11%. I would note that AOCI already flows through our regulatory capital today, so any
unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio are fully reflected in the 10.6% that I just quoted. I'd also
point out that we hold only $4 billion of investment securities, most of which are short-dated US Treasuries.
In the first quarter, we returned $600 million of capital to our shareholders. With our strong capital position, we
have both the capacity and the intent to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while
supporting our balance sheet growth.
I'd also note that our liquidity position remains extremely strong, as we ended the quarter with $41 billion of cash,
our highest ever balance excluding the pandemic period. We also saw a 10% increase in our deposits this
quarter, including the inflows in the weeks following the recent volatility in the banking sector.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
On slide 25 of the appendix, we have provided a bit more detail on deposits than we typically do, if you'd like to
look at some of the numbers.
That brings me then to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on slide 19. For the full year 2023, we are reaffirming
our guidance of having revenue growth of 15% to 17% and earnings per share between $11 and $11.40. At this
level year-over-year revenue growth, we expect to see a significant sequential increase in the amount of revenues
as we go through the year.
In contrast, our marketing and operating expenses were already more in line with the run rate for the year in the
first quarter, though there's always some quarter-to-quarter volatility. So, the simple math then gets you to the
sequential growth in our underlying earnings consistent with our full-year EPS guidance.
There is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment, but, as Steve discussed, our
customers have remained resilient thus far in the face of the slower-growth, higher-inflation economic
environment. Our outlook is based on the blue-chip macroeconomic consensus, which continues to expect
slowing growth, though not a significant recession.
In any environment, though, we are focused on running the company for the long term. Looking forward, we
remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of
10% and mid-teens EPS growth as we get to a more steady-state environment.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question is coming from
Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I think the number that's pretty striking is the strong growth among Millennials and
Gen Z, which seem like a third of the US spending volumes. I've heard some worry about like this cohort because
they're relatively new to credit, but obviously it seems like the spending remains quite strong. So, I'm just curious
sort of how you're seeing things trend for them, whether or not you feel like there's more risk or less risk. And then
maybe, Jeff, you can elaborate a little bit more on the weaker spending trends that you saw in March. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think that – well, Jeff can elaborate a little bit more, but March was a record spending month for us overall.
It was the highest month we ever had in the history of the company. So, feel free to elaborate on that, Jeff.
But Millennials have been a big part of our growth story and, if you go back pre-pandemic, represented about
20% of our billings. Now they represent 30% of our billings, and they're growing at – I mean, last quarter they
grew at 30%. This quarter, they grew at 28%. And we're acquiring 60% of our new cards acquired.
I think from a risk perspective, they play out much like low tenure plays out, and so we really have not seen
anything different with Millennials than we have seen with any of our other card acquisitions. And so, like
anything, you watch that, but right now, we don't have any concerns with that.
And the other thing that I will point out is that this whole concept of getting more Millennials really started with our
focus on generational relevance and making sure that our products and services were attractive across an entire
cohort, and so that is really working for us, as you see in the composition of our base change. And so, that gives
me a lot of confidence as we move forward that we're making the right moves from a value-proposition
perspective and continuing to invest in the right benefits and we are acquiring the right customers. And as I've
said on these calls before, we continue to raise the bar; in the face of an uncertain economic environment, we
continue to raise the bar on who we're acquiring.
The last point that I'll make, because I think it's really relevant – and stay with me on this for a second – if you go
back to 2018 and look at all the cards that we acquired in 2018 and looked at what the first quarter spending was
in 2019 and you did the same thing in 2022 and looked at what the first quarter spending was in 2023, we are
50% higher, meaning we are acquiring higher-spending card members.
And so, I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of really sort of getting through the clutter and getting not
only more card members but getting card members that spend, getting card members that are paying fees, and
getting card members that will be with us for a long time.
So, it's a long sort of answer, but I think it really is relevant to what you were talking about in terms of Millennials,
because I think that gives you a pretty good picture of just how we are looking at that segment and just how that
segment is performing and how we believe it will continue to perform.

So, you want to talk about March, Jeff?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, the only thing I would add is we're just trying to be transparent, Sanjay. I think a lot of people describe the
current economic environment as mixed, and so March was our strongest month ever across the globe in terms of
volumes as a company. In the US, spending on all customer types on travel and entertainment is really strong.
But you did see in goods and services, as you went from January to February to March, spending slow a little bit
the growth rate sequentially.
On the other hand, you've also got to sort through how does Omicron last January/February fit into that. So, we're
just trying to be transparent about sorting through all the mixed signals, but I think we come back to our
customers overall have shown great resilience in the face of all the mixed signals in the economy, and that's what
we base running the company on.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on the slowdown that
you're seeing. I think you mentioned in the US a little bit. Are there particular types of spending you're seeing? Is it
broad based across customers? And I think you mentioned both on the consumer and small business side. So, if
you could just elaborate on that. Thanks. And then if you have any data on April you can share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, on the consumer side, just look at sequentially, consumer in the fourth quarter grew 15%, we're growing
16%, so there was really no slowdown there. When you look at US SME, we grew 8%. We're growing 6% now, so
I think there was a little bit of a slowdown in US SME. And remember, when you look at our consumer business,
our consumer business, I don't believe, is really representative of the entire economy. Our consumer business is
representative of a really high-end premium consumer base.
Our small business, because of the volumes that we have, are probably a little bit more representative, and where
you do see a slowdown in small business is goods and services. What I'll remind people is small businesses are
small businesses because they're small, and what happens is [audio gap] (00:27:18) to a level of spending, and
then, unless that business is really going to grow, you can only spend for what you're taking in.
But I think what we've seen, and this is a continuing trend, is you've seen a slowdown in a lot of the advertising
spending. But I will point out that that's not any different than what you've seen from a lot of corporations, I mean
– and ours, ourselves. I mean, if you look at it, our plan has been to spend the same amount of marketing that we
spent last year this year, and that number's $5.5 billion. And when you look at that number, we try and get more
and more efficient with that. And we push our partners to become more and more efficient as well. And so, you
get to a point of scale where you just don't spend anymore, and I think we're seeing a little of that in small
business as well.

But look, 6% growth in the US small business for the amount of volume that we have, right now we're okay with
that and it's in line with us making our overall plan. What I would point out from a small business perspective is
international is not like that. International is growing much, much faster than that, and international is back to our
fastest-growing segment. So, we'll keep watching it, but really happy with the consumer and right now, I think,
small business is kind of in line with where we have it going for the rest of our plan, for the rest of the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to get into what drove the acceleration of growth in International Card Services. Jeff, I
heard you allude to the fact of seeing results from the reorg. But could you talk a little bit more specifically about
kind of what you did in that business segment to really drive the improvement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think – so it's a couple things, right? Number one, no place in the world was more impacted by the
pandemic than international, and when you look at our card base internationally, it is a really high T&E-orientated
card base. And correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is it, 59%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
...T&E increase in our international part. So, that's number one. I mean, I think you have just some built-up
demand that had been pushed down, number one.
Number two, we continued to improve our merchant coverage tremendously in international, so there are more
and more places to use the card. And I think coverage cannot be understated or overlooked in how it drives
growth, especially in international, and I think that's really important. I think we continue to acquire new card
members in international as well.
And as far as the reorganization, what the reorganization does for us is makes us a lot more efficient, and so let
me give you an example. Sometimes it's really hard to determine whether a potential customer is a small
business or whether a potential customer is a consumer, and what you do is you put resources and you go
against – you attack them both ways.
Well, now what we're doing is we're looking at that in a more holistic way. And so, instead of having what I like to
refer to as Noah's Ark syndrome of two of everything, we now have someone in a market focused on card
acquisition, both small business, consumer and international, and large market and corporate as well.
And so, I think what we've done is, we've been able to become more efficient with our marketing, we've been able
to share intellectual property across business lines, and we've been able to, in a given market, make better trade-
off decisions from an investment perspective because we're running it much more as a market as opposed to

running it as global segments. And I think that's really given the team lot more flexibility and given them a lot more
ability to achieve their goals.
And look, the reality is international was the fastest growing part of our business pre-pandemic, and these moves
were made to become more efficient, to get it back to where it was and go beyond that. And so, we feel good
about the start that international's on at the moment.

I did want to just ask a overarching question on top line growth drivers from here, and I know we have already
spoken about a couple of different line items. I think US and large corporate is still something we could unpack a
little bit. But I would also like, if you could, just from your vantage point give us where you think the growth drivers
are from here, which 1Q extremely strong. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, in many senses, Betsy, I would almost just point you to the first quarter results, because I think one of the
drivers of our confidence is the breadth of strength we see across all the lines of the P&L. So, discount revenues,
when you look forward and look at growth, are going to look about like they did this quarter. I think you'll see it tail
down slightly, because you have a little bit of an Omicron tailwind maybe in January and February, but volumes
look good and that's going to continue to be a nice double-digit driver of growth.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
We have grown net card fees in double digits consistently for years right through every single quarter of the
pandemic, and they've been above 20% for the last couple of quarters. That's going to continue, because what
we constantly have to remind people of is it's not particularly increases in fees for any given card that drive that,
although it helps. It's mostly the steady acquisition that Steve talked about of more people on our higher-fee-
paying cards.
Net interest income, as I said, I think our overall loan balance growth will probably continue to be higher than it
was pre-pandemic but moderate a bit as our customers kind of get through the process of rebuilding balances. I
think I don't want to pretend to suggest I can predict exactly what interest rates do the rest of the year. That'll have
some impact on the growth rate.
Although I remind you, unlike most banks, the impact of rates moving one way or another on us is very, very
modest. We're reasonably hedged. There's a 10-K disclosure about that for anyone who's interested, but we're
not that heavily impacted. And then, you have the service fee and other revenue line, which is benefiting from
travel-related strength, and I think that will continue.
So, I think as you think about the drivers of revenue growth across the rest of the year, it doesn't look that different
than what you saw in the first quarter. It's very broad based, and that's what gives us confidence.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, I could just say what he said, but let me just take it up a level. And I think that one of the things that we
do in looking for opportunities is we try and make sure we're investing in those opportunities which have the
greatest return. And Jeff said this many, many times on these calls, we have more good opportunities to invest in
than we have dollars to invest.
And I think nothing is a better example of how good our opportunities – how much better our opportunities have
become, in how I answered the first question for Sanjay in talking about how the cards that we're acquiring now
are 50% in this first quarter, anyway, 50% better than they were back in 2018.
And the other thing that I would say, which I think is really important, is when we look at acquiring a customer –
and we report cards but we look at acquiring revenue. And when we look at a customer, revenue for us is a three-
legged stool. We acquire card members and a majority – 70% of the cards we're acquiring right now are paying
fees. That's a huge differentiator for us. Then what we do, you pay that fee, you use the product, and then, as Jeff
said, that discount revenue. And that discount revenue is going to grow pretty much in line with where it was now.
And then the third leg of this stool is interest income. And we've modified our product so that we have Plan It on it,
we have Pay Over Time, and so we're giving our customers lots and lots of choices in how they want to manage
their financial lives with us and then how they want to manage their credit card payments.
And so, we really focus a lot on revenue for our customers. And that's what gives us a lot of confidence, because
when we acquire a customer, it's not, okay, we're going to acquire and we're going to drive lending revenue.
We're going to acquire this customer, and it's going to be fee. We literally look at that entire basket, and as we
look at the ROIs, all of that is taken into account.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my question this morning. I'd like to discuss the accounting and strategy on fee waivers.
When fees are waived, I'm assuming that the fees are recognized and there's an offsetting expense in terms of
marketing. Are both the fees and expenses accreted and amortized quarterly? Is that the way we should think
about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think – can I maybe step back, Rick? Because in many ways, I think sometimes there's a misnomer about
when we have a line called marketing what's actually in the marketing line, right? So, there are a variety of
incentives that we offer to customers and sometimes to partners to help us acquire customers that are involved in
bringing new card members into the franchise.
And when you look at the $5.5 billion that we spend in marketing, there's a very small portion of that that is ads
that probably people talk about more. But the overwhelming majority of what's in that (sic) $5.5 billion are the
costs of the many kinds of incentives that we offer to customers.
And so, fee waivers can be an incentive or interest rates on balances that are at promotional levels, but in general
the cost of those welcome incentives are going to be amortized over varying periods, Right? We offer lots of
different kinds of marketing incentives, so I can't generalize to the exact period, but generally they're going to be
amortized over a period.
So, one of the things we always wrestle with is when you look at it in total as you're bringing more customers into
the franchise, you generally are recognizing the cost of bringing them in more quickly than they're spending and
their revenues ramp up. And so, like many companies, you sometimes have the good problem that the more you
bring new customers in, which is a good thing for the long term, in the short run that can create a little bit of a
economic headwind. So, that's the way I would think about this.

Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, FT Partners
Thanks. It's been fun getting the business up and running for FT Partners. And again, I appreciate you taking the
question. So, thinking about credit, if we look at what drove the provisioning expense in the quarter, it looks like
the allowance build was actually materially less than it was in fourth quarter despite the relatively similar provision
amount. So, it seems like you were soaking up the losses that were driven by the rise in delinquencies in the back
half of last year. But you only saw a very small increase in delinquencies in the quarter. So, I guess the question

is, are you comfortable with where allowance levels are now, especially considering they're materially higher than
where they were going into the pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, let me – can I work backwards? I think the simple way – because this is such a complex subject, as you
know, Craig, that I always encourage people to think about this is take the reserves on the balance sheet, divide it
by the total loans and receivables. That ratio is 2.5% at the end of this quarter. Compare that number to what was
day one CECL. It was 2.9%. You can compare that same number to every other financial institution that reports,
and I think that's a simple way to both track us versus history and us versus other companies. And as you know,
our 2.5% is by a long shot best in class relative to what others have.
When you think about sequential CECL accounting, what I would say is the fourth quarter of last year was
probably one of the last quarters that's still what I will refer to as pandemic CECL noise; in other words, all of the
financial institutions built all these big reserves, released them at different times. For us, and I think this is different
from any other institutions, we're kind of past that. And so, what you see starting in the first quarter – not in the
fourth quarter of last year – is really not influenced by all the noise that the pandemic drove as we all built and
then released reserves.
It's why in some ways I think going forward from here you're back to – I don't know if there's such a thing as a
BAU view of CECL accounting, because none of us have done CECL accounting in a normal world, but for us
we're sort of back at a fairly steady-state run rate. So, if you think about it, we expect loan balances to continue to
build, we expect credit metrics to continue to moderate up a little bit, and that'll cause us to continue to build a
little bit of reserve each quarter, and all of that is built into the guidance that we're affirming today.

Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, I know a lot of the business, obviously, depends on the
consumer, but you do have a very large unique commercial business. And so, if you think about the big tightening
some believe will occur, how do you think this plays out through your large and SMB businesses as access to
credit changes? And how do you think those dominoes kind of fall and affecting their spending levels or whatever
you think are the key elements there? That'd be great to hear your perspective. Thanks so much.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Well, I think let's look at how much it represents, right? Large and global accounts represent about 6% of our
overall spending, and I'm not so sure when you look at that segment that sort of credit tightening is really going to
drive their spending. That is predominantly a T&E game and most companies are trying to get their people out
and trying to get them to go out and travel, and that spending has been up 34%. We're still not back to where we
were.
What normally affects that for us is more layoffs and things like that, but even in the face of layoffs, especially in
the tech segment, or late starts that are going to occur in consulting and things like that, I think we're in a unique
situation right now where I just don't think credit tightening in that segment is really going to be an issue. I think
there, it's going to be more of an earnings story and do they do layoffs. But again, we're in such a crazy spot
where most people aren't traveling anyway and people are encouraging to travel, I don't see that.
I think when you look at small businesses, small businesses go in and out quite a bit, and you could see with
some credit tightening, some small businesses having harder access to some working capital. What I would say is
one of the things that we do have from a small business perspective is we are really – with our launch of Blueprint
and Kabbage and so forth, we have working capital loans, we have short-term loans, and so forth. And we're not
in the same position as a lot of these other smaller banks are. And so, for those creditworthy small businesses,
we will continue to extend credit. And it could be an opportunity for us, actually, provided the credit is good.
So, I think in general it can affect the small business economy and their ability maybe to grow, to get working
capital, but I think it also provides us with an opportunity, because we may not be the lender of first resort to these
small businesses right now, and I think it could be an opportunity for us. Again, judiciously, but an opportunity.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Jeff, you had talked a little bit about the OpEx being kind of flattish over the course of the year. I
think, I mean, historically that had kind of been seasonally low in the beginning of the year and seasonally high at
the end. Is there something that's changed with respect to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think, look, every year is a little different and you have a higher growth rate year-over-year, Moshe, this
quarter because, if you think about 2022, we really were in a ramp-up, as were many companies, as we came out
of the pandemic, as we all dealt with what was some pretty high attrition in late 2021 and 2022, and we were sort
of fully ramped to where we needed to be.
The way we think about OpEx, and this is actually the way we talk about it internally as well, is we have a lot of
confidence in the very high revenue growth rates that we have set out in our guidance, 15% to 17% this year. We
built the infrastructure of this company through the end of last year to manage that level of volume of revenue, so
we are where we need to be to manage that, which is why we'd expect sequentially this year to find that OpEx
pretty flat.
So, we provided guidance for OpEx of about $14 billion. If you take out the $95 million mark-to-market loss we
had on our Ventures portfolio, which was mainly driven by one company, we're pretty much tracking right to that.
And I think our record, I would suggest, over more than a decade is when we tell you we're going to hit a certain

Question just on big picture, if you will, from – if you look at the big tech companies like Amazon and Apple and
their involvement in financial services getting a little bit more, and I know that in some ways they're partners, but
what are your thoughts around the competitive risk from the large tech companies? They seem to be getting more
and more involved in credit cards and other financial service types that might be competitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, look, they've been involved for a decade. And obviously, we partner with Amazon. We work very, very
closely with Apple on Apple Pay and, obviously, they're a large merchant and a large partner. And it's not just
Apple and Amazon we look at. We look at all the fintechs and the start-ups and what have you. And that's why we
always say when you look at competition, it's just not the traditional banks. It's the fintech. It's the big tech players
and so forth. And the reality is the way that you have to compete not only against them, but compete against
everybody else is you have to give your customers what they want and you have to continually to develop better
value propositions.
And so, yeah, these are great companies. There are great banks out there. Amazon and Apple are phenomenal
companies that know the consumer. We believe we know the consumer as well. And they help us raise our game
overall. But we're not naïve enough to think that we can just go on sort of strolling down the street here thinking
nobody's ever going to compete and no one's going to come after us the way – we're paranoid. We think
everybody's coming after us, and it's one of the reasons that we constantly focus on upgrading our products and
services.
And it's one of the things that we talk about. We're constantly adding value to our products. Yeah, it would be
probably easier to not do that, but we challenge the team constantly to develop better value propositions. And so,
we worry about everybody, and the only thing that we can do about it is continue to do what we've done for years:
offer the best service, offer the best products, and make sure that our customers are happy.

Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning, Don.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I was wondering if you could talk about the bank – hi – the banking crisis. Do you expect that to impact your ability
to buy back stock? And also, was there any impact from the Delta sharing adjustment and will there be any this
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, two very different questions. So, capital and liquidity, Don, I mean, we are in a very strong position. Our
capital target of 10% to 11% on a CET1 basis is actually well above the regulatory requirement. Our target is
really driven by the rating agency view. So, none of us know exactly what's going to happen from the regulatory
perspective, but even some change in the regulatory environment could significantly increase the capital we need
to hold. It is unlikely to have any impact on what we actually hold today.
And so, look, our company has ROE of 30% or better. We generate a tremendous amount of capital. We don't
need that much capital to support our organic growth, so you'll see us continue to aggressively buy back shares,
which is why I think the board, in fact, approved a huge new multiyear target for share repurchase earlier in the
quarter. Our liquidity position is also very strong, as I talked about in our remarks.
When you think about headwinds in 2023, I'd remind you, on the January call I pointed out that a 500-basis-point
increase in interest rates in a year is a headwind for us year-over-year in 2023, which won't really exist in 2024,
[ph] though unlikely (00:53:19) do another 500 basis points. And for that matter, I just talked in response to Craig's
question about the fact that our provision this year is kind of back to a steady-state level, whereas last year you
had it still greatly impacted by CECL reserve releases.
So, those are two headwinds in 2023 we will not have in 2024. You have put your finger on the third headwind,
which is we have a fabulous partnership with Delta; works great for them; works great for us. We work together all
the time. You seem to see Steve and Ed together like every week practically. But it is true that when we renewed
early the partnership back in 2019 and extended it through 2030, we agreed to a change in the rates of how some
of the economic sharing worked effective the year the original contract was going to expire, which was 2023.
So, there is a step-up this year that flows through various lines in the P&L, but generally falls into the variable
customer engagement line, so that's part of what drove us up a little bit on the 42% to 43% target that we have
this year. I would point out that's another sort of headwind to our earnings growth this year that we will not face in
2024. So, thank you for the question.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. I had just a question on T&E renormalization. With T&E up 39% again
year-on-year, it's still clearly renormalizing a bit post pandemic, as you highlighted, particularly outside the US. Do
you have a sense, like, looking under the covers at the spending dynamics, how much further that has to go and
when we might see that piece that's been driving some of your disproportionate growth moderate a little bit? I
think some folks might have been expecting that to start happening already at the beginning of this year, but
clearly, it's not happening, so I'm wondering how much more we've got to go on that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I think you still have quite a bit to go on T&E and especially as corporations start to bring back their T&E spending
as well. And T&E spending is up in every single segment that we have. I mean, we talked about total T&E up
39%. The consumer's up 30%. Commercial's up 41%. It keeps growing. And we talked about international up
59%. So, we still think we have more room to grow.
And I talked about bookings with airlines. And airlines will also expand their capacity, and as they expand their
capacity, we'll continue to grow with them. So, I think there's still more upside in airlines, and when there's more
upside in airlines, it becomes more upside in lodging. And people have just gotten used to eating out. And the
restaurant spending is – if you ask me about anything that surprises me, it would be restaurant spending
continuing to be as strong as it is. But I think for us, a lot of that has to do with Resy and the fact that we are able
to probably even get a larger share of our Card Members' restaurant spending as they book their reservations
through Resy.
And the other thing I'd point about Resy, Resy's been a really nice addition to our acquisition of new cardholders,
who have a propensity to want to eat at restaurants and T&E. So, I think you're still going to see very strong T&E
throughout this year. It'll certainly outpace our goods and services. And we're getting back. We're continuing to
climb back. If you remember, pre-pandemic we were around 70/30 in terms of our spending, 70% goods and
services and 30% T&E, and there really is no reason that should not go back to the way it was. So, we think we
just have upside in T&E.
