Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Following our initial prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, Gunjan and John will take any questions that you have.
I will now turn the call over to Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.03 and generated total net
revenue of $6.9 billion. The quarter was highlighted by strong growth in net interest income, good momentum
across several fee business initiatives and continued expense discipline, which supported modest positive
operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared with the third quarter of last year. Our return on tangible
common equity was 17.9% this quarter.
Turning to slide 4. Revenue growth on a linked-quarter basis was driven by improved spread income from more
favorable loan mix, continued fixed asset repricing, proactive and disciplined liability management, as well as
strategic actions taken on our investment securities portfolio. John will provide more detail on these action in his
prepared remarks. On the upper right-hand side of the slide, you will see that nonperforming assets, the net
charge-off ratio and late-stage delinquency metrics were all relatively stable compared with the second quarter
levels. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.5%, an increase of 20 basis points from
last quarter driven by continued earnings accretion. Our tangible book value per share increased to $24.71, a
6.7% improvement linked-quarter and an 18.5% higher than last year.
Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. This quarter, our return on average assets increased to 1.03%, the
efficiency ratio improved to 60.2%, and net interest margin expanded 7 basis points to 2.74%.
Turning to slide 6. We continue to see good momentum across many of our fee businesses. This quarter, we
achieved year-over-year double-digit growth in both commercial and investment products revenue, driven by
underlying capital markets activity and wallet share gains across our targeted industry verticals. Additionally, we
also saw good year-over-year growth in trust and investment management, payment services, mortgage banking,
and treasury management fee revenues as we benefited from a combination of improved underlying market
conditions, deepening client relationships, and expanded product set and expanded distribution channels.
Let me now turn the call over to John who'll provide more detail on the quarter, as well as forward-looking
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy.
If you turn to slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet summary followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings
trends. This quarter, total average deposits decreased 1.0% on a linked-quarter basis to $509 billion as we
continued to prioritize relationship-based deposits and maintained our pricing discipline. Average loans totaled
$374 billion, a modest decrease of 0.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Industry loan growth remains muted and the
decline we saw this quarter was driven by slightly lower commercial balances, given continued headwinds from
capital markets-related paydowns and continued relatively low utilization rates.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Within retail, higher credit card loan balances and improved revolver rates drove more favorable loan mix and
margins. As Andy mentioned, this quarter, we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment portfolio to
enhance our net interest income growth trajectory and to further strengthen our capital and liquidity profiles. At
September 30, the ending balance on our investment portfolio declined slightly to $167 billion, with an average
yield for the quarter of 3.20%.
Slide 8 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continued to develop in line with our
expectations and reflected ongoing macroeconomic stability. This quarter, we saw a slight reduction in our
exposure to commercial real estate office portfolio, which remained appropriately reserved at 10.8%. Late-stage
delinquencies and nonperforming asset metrics were relatively flat on a linked-quarter basis and the ratio of
nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was unchanged at 0.49% linked-quarter versus 0.35% year-
over-year.
Our net charge-off ratio of 0.60% increased 2 basis points from a second quarter level of 0.58%, in line with our
expectations. At September 30, our allowance for credit losses totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period-end loans.
We expect our fourth quarter net charge-off ratio to remain relatively stable compared with the third quarter level.
In the near term, we expect changes to the loan loss reserve to be driven primarily by loan balance growth and
mix.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed earnings summary. In the third quarter, we reported $1.03 per diluted share,
which included $119 million of net losses or $189 million after-tax on sales and securities rebalancing actions
within our investment portfolio. These actions were largely offset by tax favorability in the quarter, primarily due to
settlements in various tax jurisdictions.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.17 billion, an
increase of 2.8% linked-quarter. Our net interest margin increased 7 basis points to 2.74%. Both net interest
income and net interest margin growth this quarter benefited from a combination of earning asset repricing and
mix, further supported by higher card revolve rates, investment portfolio actions, and disciplined deposit pricing.
Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $2.7 billion and, as mentioned,
included $119 million of net securities losses related to rebalancing activity within our investment portfolio.
Importantly, year-over-year, we saw good growth across our core business offerings, including trust and
investment management, commercial products, mortgage banking, and investment products. As a reminder, last
quarter's mortgage banking fees included an approximately $30 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights.
Service charges decreased 6.2% linked-quarter, partly reflecting the impact of exiting our ATM cash provisioning
business. The exit is now fully reflected in our run rate for the third quarter of 2024.
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, which was relatively flat to the prior
quarter and 1.0% lower than a year ago, as adjusted. The linked-quarter increase of $16 million or 0.4% was
driven by a higher compensation and employee benefit expense, primarily due to higher performance-based
incentives. On a year-over-year basis, the $42 million decrease, as adjusted, was driven by prudent expense
management initiatives and the identification of operational efficiencies across the company.
Turning to slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.5% as of September 30 increased 20 basis points from
the second quarter. Looking ahead, we intend to balance our continued capital accretion of 20 basis points to 25
basis points per quarter with capital distributions starting with a modest share repurchase in the near term.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
I will now provide forward-looking guidance on slide 14. We expect net interest income for the fourth quarter on an
FTE basis to be relatively stable to this quarter's $4.17 billion. This guidance is reflective of our current
expectation for more modest loan growth and continued QT impacts on deposits. Full year 2024 net interest
income on an FTE basis is expected to come in at the higher end of our $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion range. For
the full year, we still expect mid-single-digit growth in total noninterest income, as adjusted, but likely at the lower
end of the range. We expect full year noninterest expense, as adjusted, to be $16.8 billion.
I'll now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John. Third quarter results showcase the resiliency of our unique and differentiated business model,
which featured solid top line revenue growth, supported by healthy linked-quarter margin expansion as well as
continued year-over-year income momentum and steady expense discipline. This quarter, we reported modest
operating leverage excluding net securities losses and prior year notable items and consistent with our message
at Investor Day. We expect to deliver expanding positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter that will continue
into 2025.
As recent industry headwinds become tailwinds and we realize the benefits of our now run rate investment spend
on industry-leading digital capabilities, integrated payment solutions and continued technology modernization, it
will be the combination of our scale, our interconnected business model, and our deep and talented management
team that will allow us to capitalize on the many objectives and targets at this important inflection point in our
story.
As always, let me close by thanking our over 70,000 employees for their everyday commitment to our clients,
communities, and shareholders. We'll now open the call for Q&A.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.
Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. John, I guess, I wanted to start with NII. So, at least relative to what I had anticipated, looks like it came in
better than you might have thought even as recently as a month or so ago at the Investor Day. I guess, just in sort
of simple terms, can you walk through what in your mind ended up coming in better than you might have
anticipated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Scott; and good morning. So, a couple factors I would say there. First, I think the remixing of our portfolio,
we continue to see strength in our credit card and revolve rate, as we discussed in our opening comments. It's
great to see that business is even growing at 8% year-over-year on the loan side of things. Our fixed asset
repricing continues. And then the other factor I would just say is that on the – what we didn't know is the Fed was
going to cut 50 basis points and we had the ability to really price on our deposits. And so, I think the combination
of all those things really helped us power and see nice momentum here in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. And if I could switch gears to fees for just a second. Just wanted to chat about the – sort
of the implied fourth quarter number. So, even if we get to the lower end of the full year fee guide, I guess, that
sort of implies that fourth quarter fees would get back up near sort of a $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion level that might be
more typical of one of your seasonally stronger quarters, like typically I think of you all doing best in the second
quarter? Maybe if you can just sort of walk through the main puts and takes and where you would see sort of a
reacceleration in momentum into the fourth quarter, please?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Sure. So I think it's just in a number of different things. And as we discussed in our opening comments, the core
business components are performing quite well. We had strong growth in trust 6%, commercial products was over
double-digits at 12%, mortgage had nice year-over-year growth at 8%, and payments, while it came in at 3% or so
this quarter, we do have expectations of growth in those particular businesses in the fourth quarter. So, all that
kind of leads into some momentum there from a fee standpoint. So, of course, we've some headwinds there that
we've talked about like exiting our ATM business, some of the prepaid card metrics and some of the other things
like that in the payments. But all in all, that's what gets us and gives us confidence in our mid-single-digit growth
on the fee side of things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Good. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Scott.

Operator: Your next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I know you cited the partial securities repositioning in the quarter. Wanted to see if you could give us a little bit
more color on what you restructured in the quarter and the sizing of that and the yield. And then, do you expect
further actions on that front and would further actions already be factored into your NII expectations? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, John. So, in terms of the securities repositioning, we did take action on, what, $119 million of
losses. In total, there's about $10 billion in total of notional that was transacted. But importantly for you all, I mean,
we consider that more or less a two-year payback is kind of how we're thinking about it. I would call the impact to
the quarter maybe around $10 million or so. So, there's probably a little bit more pickup in the fourth quarter
related to it. And as I think about in the future, we don't have any other of these sorts of things contemplated in
our guidance or anything like that. It's just this was an opportunity that came up with – as we saw interest rates fall
quite a bit, we were able to take advantage of that, and we feel good about the transaction. We're constantly
looking at these things, but we don't have anything contemplated at this particular point in time.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then separately, on the expense side, you put up some pretty good positive
operating leverage this quarter and implied that fourth quarter you'll see that as well. And I believe, at the Investor
Day, you expressed confidence in continued positive operating leverage. As you look at 2025, can you maybe
help us get a sense of the magnitude of that operating leverage that you think is reasonable as you enter 2025
and longer term? I believe the Street is looking at about 150 basis points to 200 basis points operating leverage
next year. Wanted to get your thoughts on that as we look at your return profile in the coming years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, John. This is Andy. So, as you saw, we reported positive operating leverage of approximately 30
basis points in Q3 here. The guidance that John provided would indicate that our expectation for positive
operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be north of 1% and we would expect it to continue to expand
from there into 2025, so building upon that 1-plus percent into 2025. Exactly where we'll get, we'll give more
guidance as we give the forward-looking guidance that we think about 2025 across the categories.

Yeah. Just two. One follow-up on that is, in the guidance for 4Q, you indicated expenses at ~ $16.8 billion. And I
know in the past you had been saying $16.8 billion or less. So, is there anything we should take away from that
very ever so slight guidance change?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Hey, Betsy. It's John. So, I think it's just reflective of we're in the third – we're complete with the third quarter,
we're at the fourth quarter right now. We have a very good line of sight into what our expense base will be, and so
we were just being more precise with that particular number. In addition, we saw good growth in our net interest
income, and so it's kind of – the expense was coupled in part with the net interest income. You'll recall we shifted
our discussion points on that; and since we're at the higher end of our range, we feel like $16.8 billion is the
appropriate expense side of things this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on the rate discussion earlier, you got the surprise 50 basis points, which
you were able to pass through onto the depositor side. So, as we're thinking about the next several quarters here,
does NIM expand further as rates continue to come down, or is there a catch-up on the asset side that we should
be skewing to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think, broadly speaking, rate cuts are a positive thing for us, in the sense that we have a deposit base
that's conducive really to cuts. We have the ability, as you know. 50% of our deposit base is in institutional and
50% is retail. We're able to cut institutional rates fairly quickly. And so, the beta for this particular juncture was
around that, I'll call it, 30% area for this particular cut. And we expect that to continue to migrate closer to or up to
just north of 50% as we kind of get through the cycle and that sort of thing. And so, that's going to be helpful. And
I think the other thing is, over time, as the cuts happen, then that implies a more upward sloping curve which
should help us in our trajectory going forward as well. So, those are the two pieces that I would point to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And the 30% and 50%, that's on total IB deposits or total deposits which is [ph] nonlinear (00:19:24)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just a few follow-up questions. First, on John's previous question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Sorry, Erika, can you just – we're having a hard time hearing you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Can you hear me better now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, that's better. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Sorry about that. Just wanted to follow up on John's question. You mentioned $10 billion of notional was
sold. So that we can understand the impact for fourth quarter, could you tell us what the average yield was of
what was sold and what you invested in? And just a follow-up to Betsy's line of questioning, you said that you saw
a 30% beta and the terminal would be north of 50%. As we think about the fourth quarter, is it a sort of a smooth
glide path to that 50%? Do you expect it to significantly accelerate from that 30% initial beta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So maybe I'll just take those in pieces. The first one on the securities book. I think it was just an opportunity
there to remix in a couple different things. And it was really there to improve our liquidity profile, as well as some
lower-yielding securities that have seasoned to reposition those. So, it was just a number of different securities.
So it's hard to just summarize it in one thing. But I would just say, on the beta side of things, 30% or so terminal
beta, I think that just is a gradual increase as we look forward. And the reason for that is, on the institutional side,
you're going to get that benefit on each cut. On the retail side, you're going to get that benefit kind of, as I
mentioned in the past, kind of an arc to the retail pricing sort of thing. And so, as CDs reprice and as the money
market rates come down on retail, that's going to be kind of that glide path into the 50% terminal that I spoke to
earlier.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And, John, all of that – all that you said, which is spot on, is all baked into your flat or stable net interest income
projection for quarter four.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
That's exactly right, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is for you, Andy, and this is sort of a broader question. You hosted a very
comprehensive Investor Day and I think the investor reception at least as it followed through to the stock was
probably less than desired. And as I think about the feedback from investors, I'm wondering if you could sort of
readdress this on this call. You seem determined and you have showed us positive operating leverage. Maybe
some quick notes on 2025. The comments on the Southeast expansion was also hit on as a potential negative.
And the third would be, you're now in a place where you're building capital, loan growth hasn't yet come back,
what would allow you to be a little bit more aggressive more quickly on acting on that $5 billion authority?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So I'll take them in pieces, Erika. So, first of all, I thought the team did a terrific job articulating the strategy at
Investor Day, and part of that strategy was the inflection point discussion we talked about, which is controlled
expenses, delivering on operating leverage, and stronger revenue growth given the interconnectedness of the
businesses. And we're hitting on all those. And I think part of what the analyst community and investor community
wants is examples and execution. And this quarter we started that execution and as I said on operating leverage,
we expect that to expand into fourth quarter and into 2025. So we're going to deliver on that.
Secondly, with regard to the M&A environment, given this environment, large bank M&A is not a priority for us.
That's not something we're focused on. What we are focused on is organic growth and the components that
Gunjan talked about. And I'm going to ask her to just highlight some of those key aspects to that right now.

Gunjan Kedia A

Good morning, Erika. As we shared during the Investor Day, we do have very meaningful organic growth
opportunities in our portfolio. And as Andy said, our attention is very much on executing against those priorities:
deepening our client relationships, enhancing our product interconnectivity, and broadening our reach. We are
very focused on delivering meaningful positive operating leverage and the execution that goes with it. We have
optimized our distribution via investments in our digital capabilities and our Southeast expansion is very much
focused on our partnerships and our digital capabilities. Thank you.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Gunjan. And then finally on your last question with regard to capital, Erika, as you know, as we talked
about and as John articulated in his comments, we would expect to go into some level of modest buybacks here
shortly. And then we would expect to build upon that once we have more clarity on Basel III and some of the

capital rules. And then loan growth, as you talked about, is a key factor as well. But given all that, we would still
expect to be at our capital targets even under the Cat II when we've crossed that threshold, which again as a
reminder and we talked about is not expected till 2027.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I guess, just to follow up on that, the Basel III shouldn't impact you that much, right? And everybody had already
put in the impact of AOCI actually more immediately than whatever phasing Basel III endgame has. I guess, I'm
wondering, as a regional bank, do you think you're just a prudent constituent in terms of not wanting to be
aggressive ahead of a new set of revisions? Or are you also considering the ratings agencies, just sort of
wondering what the – and I completely understand that you're about to buy back in the first quarter. But I think
that it's probably an important component of long-only investors starting to increase their position in U.S. Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. All those constituencies you talked about are factors in our thinking. Loan growth, the final capital rules, the
rating agencies, those are all factors. But we're very confident in our accretion ability. You just saw this quarter 20
basis points. We've articulated 20 basis points to 25 basis points. We're very comfortable with our capital position
and we're very comfortable with the ability to start to buy back and distribute as well as accrete the level of which
we'll continue to determine and judge over time given all those factors you talked about.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Not even a small bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Mike, the environment right now is just not conducive. There's too much uncertainty for M&A. And I don't want to
focus all our efforts on that when we have so much opportunity on the organic growth front. So, in this role, what
you do is prioritize against the opportunity set that you have in front of you, and our organic growth opportunities
are far more important and much more tangible to us right now. And as you know, Mike, the M&A environment is
just so uncertain right now, that would not be a good place to focus our efforts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So my main question here, it goes back to the operating leverage, which is – how much of this is expenses
versus revenues? And on the expense side, your investments in the last three, five, more years, it's all in the run
rate, as you said at Investor Day. And how much benefit do you get from being a scale player? Because some
smaller banks said they can just buy a lot of these things off the shelf and compete with the likes of U.S. Bancorp.
So, that's the expense question. And then the revenue question is, Gunjan, I know you're leading the go-to-
market strategy, kind of what stage of that go-to-market strategy in, are we seeing the results now, or do we
expect to see more of that in the results ahead? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Mike, I'll start and then Gunjan will add on. I think, to answer your question, I'd think about it on both
components. I think it's going to be both increased revenue growth and managed expenses. So, as we talked
about, we were flattish this time. We might have some modest increase as we go into next year, but we're not
going to have expenses growing above revenue levels and I would expect growing revenue and those jaws
widening from the expense/revenue differential. The revenue will be driven by the activities that Gunjan is focused
on, and I'll let her comment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Mike. The go-to-market is in its third and final year of our transformation, so we're beginning to
see the results in some of the areas like the consumer deposit. We built out a lot of capabilities to manage deposit
pricing. We benefited from that in this downgrade cycle. We're seeing a lot of momentum with our multi-serve
clients and deepening our relationships on the institutional side. We saw that with the capital markets growth over
this quarter. So, the impact of a good, scaled business model is delivering good positive operating leverage,
including expense management. So, this is what we would continue to focus on from an organic growth
standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Thank you.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi Andy. Hi John. John, on the deposits – or on the deposit pricing, can you share with us, the loan to deposit
ratios for the industry and yourselves are not as high as in previous cycles. Do you think that can give you added
flexibility in lowering the costs, aside from obviously you talked about the institutional deposits that are essentially
I think index-priced, so they come down quickly. But in the other deposit classes, do you think you're going to
have some leverage to lower those rates because the loan to deposit ratio is not at 90% or something like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Gerard. So I would say that we don't target necessarily loan to deposit ratios. What we look at is holistically
just overall serving of our clients, making sure we have the right mix of deposits and loans. And loan growth is
obviously going to be a driver or not of deposits and where they're at. This quarter, loans were flat to down just
slightly, and so we took this opportunity to bring down some deposits that were at a higher cost side. And you saw
that in the results here. And so, if that continues, we would continue to expect that. Conversely, if loan growth
continues to take up, we're going to be making sure that we have the deposit base to suffice that. The other thing
we always try to manage around that is our liquidity needs as well as interest rate risk profile as well. So, it's kind
of more of a holistic nature as it relates to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then for Andy or Gunjan, on the organic growth strategy, some of your peers, the bigger banks in
particular, have embarked upon a branch build-out across the country, even two regional banks have done this as
well. Can you share with us, as part of your organic strategy, how you guys view new branches into maybe newer
territories combined with your ongoing digital reach-out that of course you have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Gerard. Maybe I'll start here. So, first, the branches are very critical to our business strategy. We
see deep client relationships anchored around the branch. It really drives brand recognition. And we are very
steady in investing in our branch network. Our strategy focus is to create density in the highest growth areas
within our current footprint rather than use branches to expand out of our footprint. And the reason for that is that
we have built some very good strong digital capabilities that allow us to deliver our services nationally, and we are
combining that with our very strong partnerships with other partners that have brand recognition and client reach
in areas where we don't have. It's a powerful combination. It's a capital-light way of expanding into other markets.

Second is our national businesses from the institutional side, there we are actually growing client centers in areas
where we are not to expand our reach. So you'll see us continue to invest in the branch network both inside
digitally enabling them, but within our current footprint.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Vivek.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to understand on payments and delve a little bit into that. You
talked last quarter about corporate payments will be lapping this quarter because you had tough comps with your
trucking-related fees last year, but we didn't really see the benefit of that lap in this quarter. So, anything there that
has caused it to be delayed nor have we seen really merchant payment pickup in terms of year-on-year fee
growth? So, any color on what's going on and why the delay and what gives you confidence that it'll actually
materialize in the coming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, Vivek, I would start by saying that I think there was still a little aftermath here on the freight side in the
third quarter, but we expect that to completely lap here in the fourth quarter. And then we do see corporate spend
being stronger. We saw some nice momentum at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, and
that's what's really giving us the confidence that that will grow from the level that you saw in this quarter's results
from a corporate payments perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Maybe, John, I'll add – good morning, Vivek – just a little point on the long-term expectation for payments. Where
payments is in the mix with the client relationship, it creates really sticky, enduring relationships. We do see good
core growth in many of the categories of payments. They are partially offset by some unique items. Freight is one
of them, which was very disrupted post-COVID and just is beginning to normalize, and there are some others as
well. So, the long-term confidence question that you asked, as we look at the client value and we look at the core
dynamics and you'll see that continue to improve over time.

Thanks for that. I have a follow-up for John. John, I just want to – your comment earlier in response to a question
just piqued my interest. You said expenses were up because net interest income was up. Is there incentive comp
tied to growing net interest income or is there something else that would drive expenses up when you get net
interest income up? That's not really – any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Vivek. No, there's no linkage. What I was getting at is we're in the – in the fourth quarter, we have a very
good line of sight on what our expense level. So we're just being more precise really with it. I was comparing that
to our net interest income that has gone up higher and is in the higher end of our range. I was just making a
comparison. There's no linkage from a compensation perspective in that sense. So we're just being more precise
is the short answer.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, Andy. I guess, one question maybe first on fees, and I appreciate you're not talking about 2025
right now. But just talk to us in terms of the linkage of the fee momentum accelerating from this mid-single digits
into next year and how much of that is dependent on loan growth picking up or how much of that can happen
where even if loan growth or loan demand is fairly muted in the first half, we see better fee revenue momentum
being a differentiator for USB?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. From Investor Day, we talked about mid-single digits being in terms of our range from a financial metric
performance. And I think what you saw this quarter is a good example of that, particularly looking at commercial
products, which has benefited, of course, from loan growth being done more in the capital markets space. We see
that benefit in our businesses. But we've also grown and have new products, new capabilities in that space.
Mortgages is continuing to see nice growth as that has gone. The service charges has – we'll start to lap the ATM
exiting business as we think about that starting in 2025. Corporate trust continues to be just a very strong growth
rates. And that is tied in part to the markets, of course. And so, as that continues to develop, we have good
momentum there. And Gunjan just talked about the payments side of the house. And so I think all those things put

together really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of that mid-single-digit growth that we think of on the medium-
term standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Ebrahim, I'll just add that we do have a very beautifully diversified fee mix. So, right now, we're seeing a lot of
growth in capital markets; and to some extent, that's impacting loan growth. But our capital markets businesses
are very strong otherwise too. Wealth is seeing a very good year because the stock markets are very strong, our
investment services businesses benefit from that. And then, as the rate environment changes, we would expect
mortgage to have certain momentum. So, really as we go into the next year, it isn't any one thing, but it's a
diversified mix because they play off of each other depending on different macroeconomic environments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I guess, one follow-up, John. When I look at the 7 basis points NIM expansion, I think you
mentioned $10 million lift from the bond book restructuring. That's probably a basis point. Should we expect the 7
basis point expansion as getting better as we move forward with a couple more rate cuts this year, the back book
repricing? Like, how should we think about the cadence of the NIM from here ex any kind of bond restructuring
actions? And is it conceivable that we could be at a 3% NIM in the back half of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, maybe just to go off of a couple those points. From a net interest income standpoint, in the fourth
quarter, we expect to have relative stability. And that's just thinking about our earning assets are going to be
relatively flat we expect and our asset repricing and liability pre-pricing are going to be largely offsetting. So that's
kind of how we think about the stability component in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, all the positive momentum
that I talked about in terms of continuing remixing in terms of our assets into higher return parts of the portfolio,
our ability to reprice on deposits, as I mentioned, on the institutional side and then ultimately on the retail side.
And then our deposit rotation, as you have observed, is slowing down and for all intents and purposes complete.
And so, that's all conducive to growth and continued expansion. I can't put a timeframe on when exactly 3%
occurs, but that's a good level to think about. And obviously, it's embedded within our medium-term guidance that
we provided to you during Investor Day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And one last one. I guess, maybe, Andy, I think you mentioned and you mentioned this on the Investor Day on the
2027 becoming a Cat II bank. Is that in any which way a constraint as we think about pursuing loan growth? Like,
is there any reason to believe USB is disadvantaged on pursuing loan growth next year because you have an eye
on the $700 billion asset number? Just address that if you don't mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, there is no constraint on our loan growth. The loan growth activity right now is more a function of demand and
consistent with the market overall and the HA data that you're seeing and we have no constraints on loan growth.
And again, as a reminder, Ebrahim, the way it works is you're at that $700 billion for four quarters on average. So,
when we think about 2027, that's four quarters of impact, so we have no constraints on our assets or our balance
sheet.

Good morning. I think you guys announced that you're looking for a new payments head and were looking
externally. And we just wondered if you could update us on if there is any updates on that. And then, I guess,
what type of person are you looking for and is it to kind of continue the strategy that you had or potentially
reevaluate some areas? I think there's the general view that maybe you could do more with payments given what
the revenue [ph] quarter is (00:42:21) overall and that you've kind of under-punched a little bit. So I don't know if
you'd agree with that, but what's the thought in terms of what you're looking for in the new leadership? Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia A

payments. We have a lot of interest in our franchise. It's unique. It's different. It's very important for us. And we do
have big aspirations for not just a standalone sort of payments franchise, but how much it embeds and integrates
with the everyday life of our customers. So, with that, we are looking for someone who is talented from a
payments perspective, but culturally embraces this concept of an interconnected set of solutions for our client
base. And that's what we are looking for. And just to reiterate what we shared, we have a long transition time,
very grateful that Shailesh has given us enough time to plan a very smooth and careful transition.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I guess, just from a strategic point of view, and this isn't trying to lead you one way or the other, but are you set on
kind of the long-term strategic path that you have in payments or are you open to potentially fairly decent size
changes one way or the other? Again, not really leading question; but it seems like it might be an opportunity to
take a fresh look and look for some opportunities that maybe you haven't before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gunjan Kedia A
President, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Matt. We have deep conviction around the strategy and the path that we are on today. When you
meet clients and you see the impact of the payments products sets on the relationships we have, you sort of build
that conviction. So, the question that we are focused on is how do you execute perhaps differently, how do you
accelerate the execution, how do you stay current with the digital capabilities. And all of the strategies that we
shared with you on Investor Day are really focused on accelerating the how rather than sort of rethinking our
strategy where we do have a lot of conviction that payments becomes the center point of how people manage
their day-to-day life and it needs to be embedded in every product, every relationship that we have.

Yeah, Mike. So, as you know, we do have scale. We invest $2.5 billion a year in technology and technology
initiatives. We did a great job with the digital capabilities. We highlighted those at Investor Day and we're following
that same model with the AI initiatives, which is the center of excellence and then the business line surrounding
them in terms of use cases. As we talked about, we have a number of use cases underway. I would say
traditional AI we've been doing for a while. Generative AI is in the early innings. And what is important is we have
a structure, expertise, leadership and technology to deliver on it. But it is early innings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just one cleanup from Investor Day as it relates to digital strategy. I mean, going through State Farm,
just one more time, and spending the whole day with management in New York City and more information always
better. But the idea of going out of market where you don't have so much branches and going through State Farm
with the digital strategy, it's just – are there other examples of banks or nonbanks that have succeeded with that
sort of approach? It's just we've heard a lot of those stories over the last 20 years and they haven't always played
out. So, eventually you have to build more branches than you expected or something. So, again, that's just a little
bit of cleanup from Investor Day. So...

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think for the strategy to work, I think you have to have a couple key components. One is the digital
capabilities to allow it to work with the other partner. The second is a partner who has the need from a banking
product standpoint for their customer base. And then alignment in terms of how that gets done. And I think both
with State Farm and certainly with Edward Jones, those pieces are in place. And we've seen good results on that.
So, opening up core banking products, checking accounts, savings accounts outside of our market through that
