Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you. For those of you that have previewed the deck, you can see we've got a lot of information to cover
today. In addition to topics we'd ordinarily cover on the call, we've got a lot of information on the COVID-19
pandemic impact and our response to it, which, I believe, has been bold and aggressive. We've got color
commentary on our adoption of CECL and the subsequent reserve build during the quarter; a much more in-depth
look at the makeup of the segments of loan portfolio that are likely more impacted by the pandemic, including a
deep dive into BHG and how we expect it to weather the storm; and an update on our entry into the Atlanta
market, which we remain excited about. So, we'll try to move quickly.
We've begun every quarterly call for a good number of years with our financial dashboard, primarily because it
gives a view of our long-term focus and our ability to execute. I recognize that this quarter, many are focused on
the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and their responses to it, which are obviously the most
newsworthy items. And honestly, in our first graph of this presentation, we led with the impacts of the pandemic.
But the truth is we've been in dialogue with investors over the last number of years regarding items like our ability
to attract revenue producers, gather low-cost core deposits, lowering cost of funds and growing fee income, those
items that produce long-term shareholder value. And so, while we'll cover the COVID-19 pandemic in great detail,
it just felt like it'd be beneficial to begin where we left off and try to offer brief insights into underlying financial
performance despite the impacts of COVID.
As we go through the material, hopefully, you'll be able to see that our decisions and actions have been both bold
and aggressive. It's inconceivable to me that on a personal basis, I guess, that when 2020 is over, that it will have
been about earnings in 2020. I suspect that it'll ultimately have been about building the earnings run rate for 2021.
And so, it's our intent to execute on the fundamentals that produce long-term shareholder value, while adopting a
more defensive posture in the early stages of the pandemic in order to best position ourselves for a return to more
normal run rates as we head into 2021.
So, for us to ensure a full disclosure, we always start with the GAAP measures. But today, I want to move quickly
to the non-GAAP measures because, honestly, for the most part, these are the things that we're managing
against.
Total revenues were up for the quarter and up 10.8% year-over-year. I think that's consistent with the large
volume of revenue producers we've been adding over the last several years. The model works. Of course, fully
diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39, primarily impacted by the elevated provision in the response to the COVID
pandemic. We'll review that in detail in just a few minutes.
And then next to the EPS chart, you can see pre-provision net revenue grew at 2.8% linked quarter, north of 11%
on an annualized basis. And that's a really important measure when considering, first of all, our ability to weather
the storm but, secondly, our ability to elevate our earnings run rate as we head into 2021.
Loan and deposit volumes were up meaningfully during the quarter. In the case of core deposits, it was our
largest growth quarter ever, which I believe is primarily attributable to the internal emphasis that we placed on
gathering low-cost core deposits over the last six to nine months. No doubt, both loans and deposits were aided
by clients building liquidity late in the quarter. But then our numbers would have suggested that loan volume
would have been slightly better than what we'd anticipated. And in the case of deposits, that they would have
been very strong and way ahead of our planned expectations.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
In general, I thought asset quality was strong. Both NPAs and classified assets were flattish. Net charge-offs
jumped up for us just a little bit in the quarter. As most of you know that have followed us for any length of time,
our charge-offs are generally lumpy. Looking at the chart there, you can see that 6 of last 17 quarters have been
20 basis points or higher.
We'll review that in greater detail shortly, but that number was highly impacted by a partial charge-off with it, we're
going to cover later on the call. So that's a 30,000-foot summary of the quarter. I think great performance on the
fundamentals, coupled with an aggressive reserve build, primarily in response to the uncertainty surrounding the
COVID pandemic.
Let me turn it over to Harold to provide a little more color commentary on the quarter before we begin to examine
the impacts of the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everybody. Loan growth was solid for the quarter. End-of-period loans
increased by $608 million during the quarter with about $250 million attributable to commercial loan draws with
most of those, we believe, in response to the pandemic by our commercial borrowers. As a result, organic loan
growth, we believe, was in the $350 million range for the quarter, which results in about 7% annualized loan
growth, which we believe is admirable given the environment.
Now the deposits, as Terry mentioned, it was a big deposit quarter for us. End-of-period deposits up almost 23%,
while core deposits were up 22% over December 31. To that point, as many of you know, we modified our annual
cash incentive plan to incorporate a core deposit growth and rate component. First quarter was a great quarter for
core deposit growth. So, as we sit today, we think our modification is working well. More on incentives later when I
talk about expenses.
Next is the usual update to our loan pricing. Loan spreads held up really well in the first quarter. So, we were
pleased to see that and hopeful spreads will continue to hold in the second quarter. Impacting first quarter LIBOR
loan yields was the absolute spread of LIBOR to Fed funds. LIBOR spent a lot of time in the first quarter pricing
below Fed funds. And at the beginning of March, LIBOR was around 40 basis points less than Fed funds. Since
substantially all of our LIBOR loans re-price on the first of the month, March was negatively impacted.
Now going into second quarter, we finished March at 3.8% on LIBOR loans with LIBOR well above Fed funds.
We're anticipating that LIBOR will work its way south towards Fed funds, so we will see absolute yield
compression and a lot more credits in the second quarter by a modest amount. It just depends on how quickly
and how far LIBOR moves during the second quarter.
It seems like it's been a long time since we talked about deposit betas. We do believe our relationship managers
did a bang-up job on managing our deposit cost in this rate environment. In the negotiated rate bucket, we've
achieved 117-basis-point decline since June of 2019. Our relationship managers are very much in tune with the
rate environment and are prepared to have more discussions with our client base about rate decreases. At a
minimum, we should experience decreases in CD rates for the next couple quarters as re-pricing occurs. All
things considered, overall deposit rates should be down in the second quarter.
A busy slide but some important information as we head into the second quarter. The NIM chart on the top left
goes back to 2007 and tracks our NIM in relation to Fed funds target rates. We all know we've operated in a zero-
rate environment before, so this is nothing really that new. The chart reflects that the longer the zero-rate

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
environment lasts, the better our NIM perform. Substantially all of us felt we were headed to a zero-rate
environment, and the pandemic put a lot of wind in those sails and certainly increased the speed it took to get
there.
Looking forward, we've got several issues impacting first quarter NIM, and that also will impact second quarter
NIM. Impacting the GAAP NIM is obviously purchase accounting, which is shown in the chart at the top right. We
recognized approximately $7.4 million of discount accretion in the first quarter. Who knows where it'll end up for
the full year. My bet that it'll be less than the $23 million we're projecting, given payment deferrals in the low rate
environment. That said, we believe we had a solid quarter for NIM performance after considering the impact of
purchase accounting.
The bottom charts detail the impact of our hedges as well as hedge unwinds and our recent liquidity build.
Countering the shrinkage in LIBOR spreads that I mentioned earlier, will be an increase in revenues from the
LIBOR loan core we still have on the balance sheet. This floor lasts for about another 4.5 years. As the chart
indicates, the floor increases in value as LIBOR continues to fall. Additionally, we have about $1.2 billion in client
floors that are currently in the money and will also become more valuable should LIBOR continue to fall.
We've also added quite a bit of liquidity to our balance sheet and intend to add more in the second quarter as we
constantly evaluate the depth of the pandemic. We've got ample sources of liquidity to fund our franchise, but we
believe it was prudent to take on this additional liquidity. The liquidity bill will likely result in more net interest
income in the second quarter, but it will also result in some NIM compression. We always have the option to
reduce this liquidity during 2020 as the potential recovery becomes more in view.
As Terry will cover more in detail in a minute, our significance is the impact of the PPP lending program. PPP was
an incredible three or four weeks around here. Significant resource allocation, a lot of blood, sweat and tears from
some very dedicated Pinnacle associates. But if it happens like it's supposed to happen, it'll definitely soften the
financial blow of the pandemic. We're also developing a strategy around the Main Street Program currently to
identify those borrowers that might be well suited for it, but the Main Street is no PPP.
Now to fee income, I'll be really brief. These were more than $70 million for the quarter, up more than 3% of the
same quarter in 2019. BHG contributed approximately $15.5 million, which was slightly less than we anticipated,
but more on Bankers Healthcare Group in a second.
Our other fee businesses had a strong first quarter, with residential mortgage leading the way, up approximately
76% year-over-year. Mortgage had a great first quarter, correlating not only with drops in long-term rates but also
with increases in the number of mortgage originated.
Again, great markets are very helpful with this line of business. The national residential mortgage market is going
through some strategic issues at present, so it's difficult to speculate on where all this is headed and how it might
impact us. We just believe we have the best mortgage originators in our markets that are there to help clients get
through the current uncertainties.
Wealth management had a big quarter in brokerage as they operated much of the quarter with record market
highs, and we may be one of the first – or one of the few financial institutions in the country that consider trust to
be a growth engine. All in all, a super nice big quarter for us.
So, now briefly on expenses. Salaries up largely due to the increased personnel this quarter compared to last
quarter. As the slide indicates, we're throttling back our hiring focus to focus on Atlanta, which Terry will discuss in

a second. Critical revenue hires around the franchise as well as critical support personnel, as we've reduced our
hiring plan by 40% in 2020.
Our incentive accrual was at 50% at quarter end. As I mentioned previously, the deposit component worked well
for us in the first quarter. We will continue to attract the EPS component to see what happens for the rest of the
year. We concluded 50% was fair right now. But suffice to say, given the first quarter results, many things will
have to break our way for that hole.
Last quarter, I mentioned that our 2020 expense run rate should approximate a mid-single-digit increase over to
4Q 2019s results, slight modification with our belief that our expense run rate should now be less than mid-single
digits for 2020.
And I will go into this more on the next slide. We've incurred in the first quarter a $5.2 million lending-related costs
related to our billing of our off-balance sheet reserves as a result of adopting CECL. So, we're not expecting that
amount to repeat next quarter, granted the absolute level of our unfunded commitment book will determine that.
So the length of the pandemic could play a critical part of where we are at the end of the second quarter.
Now CECL. I've got a lot to say here. So hopefully, we can reduce what we have to say about CECL in the future.
As I know, we're all weary of this topic. At the top of the slide, it's our rendition of a table that we've seen at
several presentations so far this earnings season.
Our day one allowance ended up at 67 basis points, which we believe is consistent with the guidance we've been
giving for several quarters. We had slightly more than $10 million in charge-offs during the quarter, due in large
part, to the partial charge-off of a C&I credit that was criticized going into the pandemic and with the pandemic
finds itself in need of equity support sooner than anticipated, which it is working on and our specialized asset folks
have a reasonable degree of confidence it will eventually receive.
One of the first things our entire Special Assets group did in light of pandemic was spend more than a week as a
group going back through every Special Asset credit and to specifically address the impact of the pandemic on
our criticized and classified loans. I take great comfort in the judgment of our Special Assets team. This is not
their first rodeo. Later, Tim will also discuss how we dug in to hotels, restaurants, et cetera and other segments of
our loan portfolio.
For the quarter, charge-offs ended at 20 basis points and other real estate increased to $2.4 million. As to
provision run rate, there's obviously much judgment involved in all of this. But all other conditions being equal, our
provision would have been, as the table indicates, in the $14 million range. Again, you have to assume our net
charge-offs would have been the same had the pandemic not occurred, so there's a lot of guess work. Allowance
for loan losses on an apples-to-apples basis, we think, would have been in the 69-basis-point range at quarter
end.
Now as for the COVID-related provision. Based on model inputs, we feel like we've been conservative here.
We've taken in a lot of relevant inputs and observations and computed allowance that takes into consideration a
wide variety of factors. We do use a third-party source for our economic projections, which uses national level
forecasting metrics. It's the same third-party we use for asset liability modeling.
So, hopefully, there is some synergy advantage by using the same forward metrics. There are four economic
scenarios in our model ranging from optimistic to baseline, pessimistic to severe, probably not too dissimilar to the
more familiar adverse and severely adverse nomenclature that we've heard about in conference calls thus far.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
In comparison to previous releases by other banks this quarter, we've also weighted the various scenarios with
the most adverse scenario having a weight of 25% and the optimistic being only 6%. The difference is allocated
basically evenly between baseline and pessimist.
As to economic projections, anticipated unemployment seems to get a lot of attention with our severe scenario
ramping up to more than 20% in the fourth quarter of this year and averaging almost 19% for all of 2021 with 4%
unemployment returning five years from now in 2024.
As to GDP, our severe model drops GDP by 25% in the third quarter of this year with a rebound to current GDP in
2022. I assume all these points to a U-shaped recovery. Our reasonable and supportable period is around 18
months. So our calculations are weighted to a time period and then incorporates the front end of the recovery, but
now they take into account the initial return to some degree of normal.
Back to the top chart on the slide, off-balance sheet reserves are not something that anyone routinely talks about.
In my opinion, I believe it's accounting on steroids. We're at $16 million at quarter-end after [indiscernible]
(00:18:43) and that was a expense this quarter, significantly higher than what we've booked in our history. That
amount represents the anticipated loss content of the unfunded loan portfolio, should a loan initially be funded
and ultimately results in a loss. Most of the loans that contributes to this reserve are C&I lines of credit which are
very short in maturities. All things considered, we're at 1.09% for their allowance at the end of the quarter plus the
$16 million in the off-balance sheet reserve, so our allowance for credit loss is around 1.17%.
Just a quick note, CECL has been in development at Pinnacle for over three years, more money for vendors than
I care to acknowledge and likely significantly more expensive is the thousands of hours spent by 10 to 15 key
leaders of our firm in getting this standard adopted. It's an extent to the accounting standard and it's been a slog,
but I want to thank them for hanging in there to get us to this point. I wish I could give them a trophy and tell them
their work is done, but we all know there is always more work coming. The big question asked thus far this
earnings season that no self-respecting CFO will answer is move again more provision at the end of the second
quarter. There are a blooming and assumptions in play here, but obviously our [indiscernible] (00:19:57), we will
get up the economic projections and we will take the pulse from borrowers throughout and at quarter end.
Organic loan growth, the impact of the CARES Act and other government programs will also have to be
considered. Many factors are outside of our control such as the development of antivirals, government imposed
restrictions on trade and travel, and the information as it come to light with increased testing. There is obviously a
lot to think about this year. Our best play right now is to use our models, designed largely around economic
projections, so it's very important than an appropriate allowance maybe. Like I said, I think we've been
conservative here. A $100 million provision is a significant investment for Pinnacle into a period of this much
uncertainty. It's more than 20 times our usual provision run rate and results in a allowance of more than 2 times
where we were at year end. Post the Great Recession, the term green shoots became popular.
There's a lot of discussion today about restarting the economy. The PPP, the other programs that make up the
CARES Act and whatever comes next has to have a positive impact. So we remain optimistic not only about the
markets where we operate, but in our business model and the 2,500 associates that work at Pinnacle. As Terry
mentioned, this management team has taken the operating position to get COVID behind as quickly and an effort
to gain as much clarity as we can about our run rates going into the second half of 2020 and into 2021. Now some
comments on capital. First, we did bring in about $80 million of sub-debt early in the quarter that were hold over
issuances from previous mergers. We also acquired about 1 million shares of PNFP earlier in the quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We've now suspended our buyback program until we're getting more clarity as to the length and depth of the
pandemic. We're now likely to redeem approximately $130 million of bank sub-debt that was previously planned
by us for remission in the summer. Additionally, we currently anticipate maintaining our dividend for the
foreseeable future. Lastly, we did experience tangible book value accretion during the quarter as our
management remains focused on this metric. Capital ratios did experience some dilution by 20 to 30 basis points
this quarter back to levels more consistent with about a year ago. Our 100, 300 ratios were basically flat with the
fourth quarter. Our participation in the PPP program shouldn't impact regulatory ratios once those funds are fully
funded in the second quarter.
Holding company cash is sufficient to carry about six forward quarters of dividends and debt service. Basically, we
feel good about our capital. Obviously, credit will be the driving force behind any changes to our previous
statements. Like probably every investment banker listening to this call, we too have been conducting stress
testing and burndown analysis using multiple scenarios. We've incorporated Great Recession default loss rates,
historical charge-off rates and other scenarios. It's way too early in this crisis to conclude that our CECL and
stress testing algorithm is accurate, but we walk away from our stress testing feeling very strongly that our capital
is strong and we will need to deliver to the common shareholders as a result of this pandemic.
This slide is new but not inconsistent with what other bankers are talking about on conference calls. The PPP
program will be significantly impactful in the second quarter, and Terry will discuss that in just a few seconds. All-
in-all, it's steady as she goes right now. The last few weeks have presented us as well as all bankers significant
challenges. We couldn't be proud of our 2,500 Pinnacle associates. Our goal today is to support our clients
particularly our borrowers, all the while making sure that we are making prudent credit decisions. We are here to
provide our clients the capital they need to weather the storm so that they initially are able to thrive in short order.
With that, I will turn it back over to Terry.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Harold. In my view isolating up the inputs of the pandemic, Q1 was an excellent quarter for us in
terms of operating fundamentals. But obviously, by the end of the quarter, we were consumed with protection,
protecting our associates, our clients, our communities and our shareholders. I can't tell you how proud I am with
the leadership and the aggressiveness of our response. As you can see on this timeline, we actually activated our
pandemic response team on January 30, just 10 days after the first known case in the US and the same day that
the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency. We had already begun ordering supplies like
hand sanitizer before we had the first cases of community spread in the US. In early March, we began restricting
business travel, inventorying the personal travel plans of our associates as we headed into the spring break
season, and communicating with associates and clients about health safety prior to the World Health Organization
declaring the pandemic.
On March 12, we limited meetings and events to less than 15, almost three days before the CDC suggested
limiting groups to no more than 50 and well before subsequent safer-at-home ordered by a number of governors
in our footprint suggested limiting gatherings to less than 10, which of course we complied with. On March 18, I
believe we were one of the first in our footprint to convert all offices to drive-through only service and we already
had greater than 50% of our back office associates working from home. And on March 20, we rolled out a
relatively aggressive loan deferral program to assist impacted borrowers. I'll talk more about that here in just a few
minutes. I don't want to [indiscernible] (00:25:39) down to each of these actions since so many are by now are
commonplace, but it does appear to me that our team was very bold in its decision making.

And on the front end of virtually all these issues and all these things that impacted associates and clients have
worked well, and we believe our clients and our associates have been well protected. In fact, to date, we have
only three confirmed cases firmwide, two in Nashville, one in Memphis. As it relates to protecting our clients, I will
say we aggressively reached out to clients to make them aware of our payment deferral program in general. Our
deferrals were structured for 90 days with an ability to defer a second 90-day should the borrower needed with no
further documentation. As you can see on the left of this slide, total deferred balances were roughly 16% and not
surprisingly were concentrated in hotels, restaurants and entertainment.
As I've listened to other banks discuss their loan deferral utilization, some resort to use it as sparingly as possible.
I'm not being critical of that approach at all. In fact, I see some merit to it. But I do want to be clear, our approach
has been the opposite. It's been our intent to help our clients build as much liquidity as possible, not knowing the
depth and duration of the pullback. And of course, as Harold mentioned a minute ago, the most impactful for
clients and most concerning effort for our firm over the last three weeks has been the Payroll Protection Program
[sic] (Paycheck Protection Program) (00:27:12). We received roughly $2.5 billion in [indiscernible] (00:27:17) and
we're ultimately able to gain SBA approval for $1.8 billion. In other words, we were able to distribute roughly 72%
of the requested funds.
Another way to look at it is based on the asset sales of our firm compared to commercial banking assets
[indiscernible] (00:27:33) and assuming an even distribution of the $349 billion in funding, we've been expecting to
distribute about $490 million, which means we have roughly 3.5 times to 4 times our share. And while I'm
incredibly proud of that and all the associates of this firm, many of them worked literally night and day, it killed me
to think that any of our clients who deserved funding were unable to receive it. And so you might guess we've
been lobbying Congress to do the right thing and refund the program by at least another $250 billion. In events
like this it's our desire to see every one of our eligible clients get the funding they need and we will dedicate
ourselves to that effort regardless of the time and effort required to do it.
Just a couple of other observations on PPP. Obviously, the largest number of loan terms come from the smallest
businesses, almost 31 times more smaller loans approved then in the SBA. In other words, in the SBA's lowest
tier, less than $350,000, we had 31 times more of those than the ones that were in its highest tier greater than $2
million. The fee income associated with volume of loans that were part of SBA's first $349 billion allocation
translates to roughly $50 million in fees, expecting to be recognized over the short life of those loans as a
meaningful down payment on the special loan loss provision we made this quarter. It's our intent to be successful
on a second round assuming Congress does indeed refund the program. We have as many applications yet to be
processed as we processed in the first stage.
Let me say that the Payroll Protection Program [sic] (Paycheck Protection Program) (00:29:23), because it was
significantly underfunded in terms of demand, put most banks across the country in a position of underserving
clients. Very few basic customers were able to get all [indiscernible] (00:29:35) that they received processed
before funding ran out. And of course, if you're one of those businesses that didn't get fund, then you might feel
like your bank let you down regardless of how herculean your effort was to get you approved by the SBA. But we
took just under 13,000 applications as I mentioned totaling $2.5 billion, we were able to get $1.8 billion of that
approved.
Our associates I think in addition to the funding, we had to get our clients prepared beforehand on very short
notice. We had people working night and day to get into position to advice and help clients, prepare to apply once
[indiscernible] (00:3014) were committed by the SBA on April 3. It was our genuine desire to get all of our clients
to the front of the queue recognizing the banks would likely be fighting for a scarce resource. It's hard to believe
that we had to stand up two new systems in a matter of days to process all that volume. Understanding the clients

that didn't get funded are frustrated, and we are too, honestly our associates have continued to work all week in
trying to ensure that those unfunded apps are in a position to launch in the event that Congress does what it
should and authorizes additional funding. Despite frustration by those who didn't get funded, for the most part our
work to advice and look after our clients stood out versus our competitors and has been widely praised among our
clients and in the local press. As obvious by now, there are probably no borrows that won't be impacted in some
way by COVID-19, but clearly there are segments like restaurants, hotels, retail and entertainment that will be
mostly impacted.
So I've asked Tim Huestis, our Chief Credit Officer to provide a deeper dive into those segments of our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Terry. Good morning, everyone. From a credit perspective, first quarter 2020 was a continuation of
our solid performance for metrics such as past due, non-performing assets, classified assets and net charge-offs.
As Terry mentioned earlier, we did experience an increase in net charge-offs from 10 basis points to 20 basis
points despite it was a result of the single credit that was directly impacted by COVID-19. Absent this credit, our
net charge-offs would have been in line with prior quarters. A little more color on that credit later. Before I get into
the following slides, first a few overarching comments. What we don't know with certainty is when economic
conditions will stabilize. It largely depends on flattening of the pandemic curve, how high unemployment ultimately
gets and whether the rebound is V-shaped or a U-shaped curve.
What we are focused on today are those things we can do to help our borrowers and minimize loan defaults. Our
strategy is, the best offense is a good defense. You've all heard Terry saying many times over, we hire
experienced bankers who know their clients. This same principle has always held true as we've grown our credit
team. We only hire very experienced senior credit officers. We currently have 24 senior credit officers and their
average tenure is 28 years or years of experience. We have our senior credit officers paired with our financial
advisors in virtually every one of our markets. Credit officers go on client and prospect calls with the financial
advisor. Further rounding our credit discipline is our credit analyst team of 96 employees. Our credit analysts have
an average of 20 years of experience.
We believe our largely unique line credit model of partnering experienced credit talent right next to the banker will
serve us well during these difficult times. Here's what Pinnacle is doing to address COVID-19 challenge. Payment
deferral program, we provided deferrals for real estate, C&I loans and consumers approximately of $3.2 billion.
We proactively reached out to clients in the most impacted areas of our loan book with a streamlined 90 plus 90
payment deferrals. Our commercial and credit clients requesting a second 90-day extension, we built a survey
tool to help us collect and quickly aggregate client responses to targeted questions. We believe payment deferrals
are a prudent step to help our clients bridge to the other side of COVID-19.
Second, Paycheck Protection Program loans. As you just heard Terry discussed, Pinnacle received
approximately 13,000 applications totaling roughly $2.5 billion, and obtained SBA approval on just north of 6,000
applications totaling roughly $1.8 billion. We believe the additional dollars to our clients will help them better
endure this difficult time. Third, enhanced monitoring strategies to produce more real time data on severely
impacted segments. In the next few slides, we'll briefly cover several of the segments most obviously impacted by
COVID. But to take it a step further to understand COVID's impact, we partnered with an industry research firm,
IBISWorld. IBIS and a team from Pinnacle work to stratify the risk in our C&I book.
We took IBIS' time proven historical quantitative metrics of industry risk level and trended risk, and combined a
qualitative overlay for impact of social distancing. The product results in a stratification of our C&I book in the

categories of highest risk, high risk, medium, low and lowest. We will use this stratification to target time and
energy where the risk levels are highest. Pinnacle has continued its approach of building a well-balanced and
granular portfolio. We've maintained our discipline regarding conservative house limits for CRE segments as well
as for C&I sub-segments. The pie chart on the right provides a quick glance of these segments that have been
most impacted by COVID and the relative size to our loan book.
Here is an attempt to be as transparent as possible regarding our loans to the hospitality industry. Pinnacle's
approach of lending to hotel sponsors that are well-capitalized and have a long history of successfully operating
hotels has served us well. As of March 31, we only had one nonperforming hotel loan of $3 million. This was an
SBA loan that was originated by a bank that Bank of North Carolina had acquired years ago.
A few items on the page to draw your attention to include. Weighted average LTV of 50%. We have provided
payment deferrals for 74% to provide them flexibility. Hospitality projects are financed largely in our geographic
footprint. Many of our hotel sponsors are also very large depositors with Pinnacle.
The second slide on our hotel book will provide detail about our 10 largest hotel loans. Some noteworthy details to
point out includes 81% of our exposure is in the Hilton, Marriott, Holiday Inn and Hyatt. We believe this brand
identity will better position our portfolio. As you can see in the chart, a conservative LTV position on these 10
largest. Most of our hotel exposure is limited service, no luxury or resort brands. Only 18% of our hospitality book
has loan maturities in 2021 and 2022. Hopefully, by these dates, the impact of COVID will have subsided.
This next slide provides details of our restaurant book. It groups together exposure to commercial real estate
developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators. Some noteworthy points
include, this segment is less than 3% of our loan book. Top two exposures are to well-known public companies
who operate restaurants. These two relationships represent 30% of our loans to restaurant operators. The listing
on the far right illustrates approximately 25% of our total retail book is being repaid from revenues of seven well-
known restaurant brands. As of April 15, 44% of our book has executed payment deferrals.
This slide will provide details of our retail loan book. It groups together exposure to commercial real estate
developers who lease to retail stores as well as clients that operate a retail business. Together, they represent
11% of our loan book. Some noteworthy details include no mall exposure. For our CRE term loans, only 22 are
greater than $10 million. Of these 22, 12 are the grocery-anchored centers. 31% are single-tenant averaging just
$1 million to tenants like Dollar General, Tractor Supply, 7-Eleven and Bojangles'. These are open. It's a very
granular book with over 800 loans averaging just $1.5 million. For our pre-construction loans, only six loans is
greater than $10 million. Of these six, two are grocery-anchored. 39% of our construction loans are built to suit.
This slide will provide some details into our entertainment music loan book. We have one financial advisor that
specializes in lending to the music publishing industry, very experienced with a strong contact throughout the
industry. Most of our loans are in the music publishing space to finance the acquisition of song catalogs. Each
catalog is made up of thousands of well-seasoned, diversified songs that are stable from an earnings standpoint.
Average LTV is under 50%.
Revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from terrestrial radio and streaming. To a lesser degree, sync
revenues generated from songs in catalogs used in film, TV commercials and general licensing. Only a limited
amount of COVID pressure to revenue is anticipated. People will continue to stream their music, but fewer bars
and restaurants playing songs may impact sync revenue. All loans have appropriate loan covenants that permit
close monitoring. Notably, Pinnacle had only one loan to a concert promoter. It was a $2 million line with very
modest usage.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
As we discussed on the call, we had one partial charge-off in the first quarter of 2020. The music team has just
one talent agency borrowing client. Due to cash liquidity reasons, this relationship was transferred to our special
assets team during late fourth quarter 2019. Significant equity was injected into the company in early 2020, thus
curing the liquidity issue, then COVID hit and revenues completely stopped. We do not anticipate any further loss
on this credit.
Now let me turn it over to Harold to provide some similar analysis for BHG and our belief about how they will
weather the storm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. I've got several charts here on BHG, but I want to move pretty quickly through. On the top left chart
on this slide, we've shown on several occasion our opinion here is that there had been no loosening, but actual
tightening of credit standards of BHG. And through all of that, volume growth has been exceptional. The quality of
BHG's borrowers has improved steadily from the early years of the firm. They continue to refine their scorecards
and increase the quality of the borrowing base. As you know, they've ramped up sophistication on credit process
as they continue to aim at segments that have high quality borrowers.
Perhaps the bottom right chart may be the most powerful chart I have to offer related to BHG's steadily improving
credit quality. As you look at the losses by vintage, losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination,
thus pointing towards a lower loss percentage over the life of the borrowing base. Recent pandemic-related
events will likely cause these lines to point upward, but the quality of the borrowing base, in our opinion, is much
higher than the borrowing base from just a few years ago.
Now more on historical charge-offs and reserve build. These are for loans that they sold to their network of
community banks. The green bars show that currently they've got about $2.8 billion in credit with banks who
acquired their loans. The orange lines shows the annual loss rate, while the blue line on the chart details the
recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks. They have been keeping the
recourse reserve for substitution losses in the mid to high 4s over the last few years, basically constant with
annual losses.
As many of you know, BHG has been building their balance sheet, thus maintaining more loans on their books
with the eventual goal of issuing debt securities collateralized by these balance sheet loans. Two positives from
the strategy in our view, BHG is creating a more diversified revenue stream and as well as creating another
funding source with the securitization technique.
That said, during the first quarter, BHG elected to pull back on this strategy and sell more loans through the
auction platform, thus generating more revenue during the first quarter. By doing this, they generated enough
revenue to significantly increase their recourse reserve for substitutions as we all entered into this period of
uncertainty. Their business flows have provided them the ability to increase this reserve and strengthen their
balance sheet accordingly. Additionally, BHG has taken a slightly more conservative position with their outbound
sales and marketing. They are purposefully electing to aim for higher FICO scores of origination and have backed
away from adding any new professional classifications to their portfolio at this time. They will continue to evaluate
this position for the foreseeable future.
Agree this is some fairly granular data, but I feel it's really important. We're not going to go through it in detail, but
in our opinion, it points to a well-diversified loan portfolio and maybe helps to eliminate some preconceived
12

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
notions that BHG is just for dentists. Dentists are absolutely important to their franchise, accounting for 11% of the
outstandings. At the bottom of the chart details the non-medical book that is growing faster than the medical book
and represents approximately 14% of total outstanding. As of April 5, total deferrals represented about 10% of the
total book. That number is currently running at about 13%. So, it slowed somewhat. These deferrals require the
cooperation of the purchasing banks, so BHG has been working with not only the borrowers but the banks to help
the borrowers get through the impact of the pandemic.
Quick [indiscernible] (00:45:51) for a comment after talking to our friends at Bankers Healthcare Group, dentists
lead the group as expected with a 35% deferral rate. As BHG talks to these dentists, they have learned that
dentists are [indiscernible] (00:46:01) emergency only and rescheduling non-emergency procedures into the
summer. As a result, dentists will need to start working six days a week upon restart to keep up with the demand.
I don't know about you, but going to the dentist is not my idea of fun. But given the current economic climate, I'm
going to look forward to seeing my dentist on a Saturday in the very near future.
We've shown this slide before. The green bars on the left chart represent originations and have ramped up with
more loans being funded, which is the result of enhanced analytics and more sophisticated marketing platforms.
With the tailwind of pushing more to the auction platform, the first quarter was a great quarter for origination, but
also business flows are strong and should help us hit as we head into the second quarter. The blue bars are the
loans on which gain on sales has been recorded as these loans are placed with bankers with gain on sale
revenues being generated. The blue bars increased in the first quarter as a result of their decision to send more
loans off-balance sheet and build reserves, a wise play from Pinnacle's perspective. The gold bars represent the
loans held by BHG on its balance sheet, for which BHG will collect interest income. Once some idea of restart
occurs and the credit markets appear more liquid, then the off-balance sheet strategy will be back on the radar.
For me, the auction platform is probably the most valuable component of BHG's unique gain-on-sale model.
Currently, they have more than 1,000 banks in their network. Their funding platform is alive and well and very
liquid. Spreads during the first quarter were some of the best in the history of BHG. As you know, BHG's
management spends a great deal of time on making sure that this platform has ample liquidity and is ready to
acquire their loans at a competitive price.
Lastly, for Bankers Healthcare Group, they have pulled back their estimates by a modest amount for 2020. Who
knows where all this is going to end up with so much uncertainty. As it stands currently, their business flows going
into the second quarter are strong as there are borrowers out there needing their products. Their marketing
engine is aimed right at higher quality borrowers in the traditional segments that BHG has significant experience
underwriting. The auction platform is liquid and spreads have been a positive for Bankers Healthcare Group.
Pinnacle remains excited about our investment and look forward to watching our friends at BHG step up during
this time.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry to wrap up.

Thanks, Harold. Quickly, as you heard from Harold earlier and in concert with generally adopting a more
defensive stance, we're substantially slowing our recruitment efforts for the foreseeable future, along with the
associated expense bill with the exception of Atlanta. We continue to believe that the opportunity in Atlanta is a
once-in-a-generation opportunity and that the timing is perfect. Indirect impacts of COVID like social distancing
may slow our efforts to some extent, but our early associate client recruiting success brings confidence that we
should stress ahead.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
And here is why we see so much opportunity in Atlanta. This is Greenwich data from both the Nashville and
Atlanta markets. It covers businesses with annual revenues from $1 million to $500 million in each. The
crosshairs represent the mean performance across each market. And so, above-average performers are above
the horizontal line and to the right of vertical line. It seems to me that the goal for any institution would be to get to
the northeast corner as quickly as possible. As you can see, what we've done in Nashville is just that. We have
capitalized on relatively poor client satisfaction among clients in the largest banks in the market. Those that had
the most share had the greatest vulnerability. Clearly, in Nashville, we were at the right place at the right time.
Now looking at this chart on the right, Atlanta, I want to make two observations. First of all, you'll notice that the
crosshair in Atlanta would suggest that the average satisfaction among clients of the banks in Atlanta is generally
less strong than in Nashville. In other words, Atlanta is less competitive in terms of client satisfaction. And more
importantly, all of these banks who possess the vast majority of all the business clients in Atlanta suffer from
below-average percentage of their service quality and are therefore extremely vulnerable. It is really an unusual
opportunity.
As a reminder, this is the slide we covered last time to paint a picture of our aspirations there. I'm not going to
review it again since nothing has really changed. And as you can see here, we've been extremely busy over the
last 12 to 13 weeks, having pretty well hired our complete initial team. As mentioned earlier, I do expect that
things like social distancing may slow our recruiting timeline down just a little bit. But at this point, we're extremely
encouraged by the response of the bankers that we're talking to there.
So, in an effort to summarize our plan [indiscernible] (00:50:50) forward in this pandemic in general, it's our intent
to move from offense to defense, to slow our investment in growth until the storm has been weathered and the
environment once again is conducive to our unusual ability to take share from the larger unwieldy banks. That
said, I believe our aggressive addition of revenue producers over the last two years, who are still in the earlier
stages of consolidating their client base, should result in ongoing growth, albeit at a slower pace and hopefully put
us in a position to elevate 2021 earnings run rate faster than figures.
We'll continue to manage those things that produce long-term shareholder value and will remain in a more
defensive posture until we more clearly see the depth, the duration of pandemic and its impacts. Specifically,
we've increased liquidity, and we'll continue to do so in Q2. We've elevated our loan loss allowance meaningfully.
And although we don't tend to cut our dividend at this time, we're still in a capital preservation mode, suspending
our share buyback and retaining sub-debt we had previously intended to redeem. For the first time since the
Great Recession, we're slowing our recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense build that goes with it
and to enable us to maximize pre-provision net revenue as an important aspect of our defensive posture.
Operator, we'll stop there and take questions.

You mentioned several higher at-risk portfolios and you guys [indiscernible] (00:53:02) in detail on all of those as
well as BHG. [indiscernible] (00:53:08) 44% of your restaurant borrowers have requested deferrals today. Can
you talk about what [indiscernible] (00:53:17) those other at-risk portfolios?

Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jennifer, this is Tim Huestis. Your question was breaking up. Was the question, we had 44% of payment deferrals
from restaurants. Are you asking what the deferral rates on the other segments have been?

Jennifer Demba Q

Yes, exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Well, I don't have all the different segments with deferral rates. We did include the deferral rates for these
key categories, but I don't have at my fingertips for the different segments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jennifer, as you can see there, the deferral rates are concentrated in those segments, given that you've got an
overall 16% deferral rate as opposed to the very elevated deferral rate in those highly impacted segments.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. Thank you. I think we're encouraged by an offensive posture, it looks like, in the
State of Tennessee, the State of Georgia and the State of South Carolina, those are principal operating areas for
our firm. Rob McCabe, the Chairman and my partner here, is active on the Governor of Tennessee's task force to
figure out how to reopen the economy as well as the City of Nashville. And so, it looks to me that you're going to
get an aggressive restart in, as I said, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina.
So, what does that mean to us? I think that you ought to anticipate that we'll work not dissimilar to the President's
guidelines. In other words, he sort of guided a phased reopening and it's based on watching the decline in cases
and then stepping back in and escalating the progress from there. I think you'll see the same thing in the state. I
know in the State of Tennessee, that will be the case, rapid opening in some places, slower opening in the more
urban markets like Davidson County, Shelby County, Hamilton County, Knox County and Sullivan County, which
is up in the Tri-Cities.
So, again, Pinnacle will then be a function of that, and we'll do the same thing. We sort of expect a phased
reopening. As you know, we've kept fundamentally all our branch offices open with drive-thru service, so there's
not a huge service degradation, but we will stagger into it. We've already begun building the reopening kits and
we'll use shields for tellers, protective shields not dissimilar to what you've seen in some of the grocery stores.
There are a variety of things that are included in the supply kits we're building to actually reopen on a full-service
basis.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the great detail. Really appreciate [indiscernible] (00:57:10). I guess
maybe first just on the provision. From what you've seen so far in April, is there any expectation for changing the
weightings of your different scenarios or is that too early to tell [indiscernible] (00:57:25)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Jared, this is Harold. I don't think we'll be changing any weightings just right now. We'll probably be getting
new economic projections in short order and then we'll likely get some more before the end of the quarter. So,
we'll just have to see what those look like. But as it sits right now, we're not planning on changing those
weightings.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And does the provision fully impact incentive comp [indiscernible] (00:57:58) as we see higher provisions
fully flowing through to the incentive comp or is there some type of [indiscernible] (00:58:05) provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'm not sure I got all of your question. We're having a bad connection today. But I think you were trying to
ask a question around our provision and how it correlates with incentives. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's correct, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. Yeah. Currently, the way the incentive program would work is we don't have any kind of exception for
provision expense, so that would be included in our however we openly end up with respect to the incentive plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then on BHG, when we look at the recourse obligation that's on slide 33, should we think of that it's
similar to a provision or is that forward-looking and based on our expectations or is it based on actual
[indiscernible] (00:58:58) come through or requests that have already come through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the recourse accrual is there for eventual substitution risks that may exist in the portfolio that's been
sold to the community banks. And so, it is forward-looking and it is an attempt to kind of cover whatever that
future loss rate may be as of March 31.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then to BHG loans that are in deferral, do those qualify for substitution or [indiscernible] (00:59:31)
besides just a COVID deferral?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Now, BHG is not subject to CECL, so those community bank loans would be included with a kind of a similar
thought process as the loans that are on BHG's balance sheet. So, the way BHG looks at the loans off-balance
sheet is the way they look at it for loans on balance sheet. There is substitution risk and that's just nearly in lieu of
credit risk for the loans that are on the balance sheet. Did I answer your question, Jared?

Jared, this is Terry. I think if I understand the question, the loans that are on bank's balance sheet and therefore
subject to the substitution will be treated like any other bank assets, meaning that the deferral is looked at
differently for those loans than it would have been in the past as it relates to TDRs and therefore substitution put
back in all those kinds of things.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that number is somewhere in the $2 billion range as far as what's left to draw.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Harold, I think as it relates to line utilization, it goes up and down. And today, the line utilization would be at a
lower level than it was at quarter-end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. In April, the $250 million has come back to like $180 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Is that what you're asking, Stephen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That is. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Going back to BHG, I know you gave the recourse reserve. Do you have a level of reserve what BHG actually has
on balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That reserve is about I think 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And I guess, why would that be so much lower than [indiscernible] (01:02:37)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
It's about 3%. Why would it be less than the reserve for the...

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
The substitution for the community bank loans, is that a question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah [indiscernible] (01:02:54)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think what they're doing is they're looking at it – first of all, there's prepayment losses in the off-balance
sheet book. So if a loan prepays, they reimburse the bank for that. And with the loans on balance sheet, they
haven't recognized any prepayment gain. So that runs about a 1.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So that's how...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And last thing from me, hopefully you can hear this [indiscernible] (01:03:27) I know you gave a lot of detail
how you think the reserve is justified, but with your exposure to C&I, can you talk a little bit about just kind of the
loss expectations in C&I, the 130 basis points you said in the presentation, kind of maybe you [indiscernible]
(01:03:49) or what the assumptions are [indiscernible] (01:03:54) potentially just to frame up the reserve that
might explain a little bit lower than [indiscernible] (01:03:59) on a percentage basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. Well, I've been looking at several disclosures regarding CECL and the allocation of reserves. I think by
and large the credit card books are getting closer to 9% to 10%. I'm not seeing many disclosures yet on what the
C&I and the CRE books may be allocated for our peers, but as it sits right now, the way our models work, that the
allocation for C&I, I think you mentioned 1.3 seems to be reasonable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Hey, good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we can hear you. You're loud and clear Tyler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Perfect. I've got a couple more on BHG, if I can. Well, I guess, first, thanks for all the details in the slide deck last
night. I think that was extremely helpful and much appreciated. I appreciate the earlier comment around spreads
around BHG in the first quarter remaining strong and the demand there still being I think record levels. But I
guess, later on in the quarter and even so far into the second quarter, have you seen any decline in the
willingness of those thousand or so downstream banks to buy BHG paper more recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Tyler, we got an email this morning from Al Crawford, the CEO of BHG, I think he believing his April will be as
strong as it's ever been. Their paper is still in strong demand. And so it looks like the one in the second quarter
thus far BHG will hold. If I can follow back up on Stephen Scouten's question regarding the reserve between
allowance and recourse obligation, the allowance also includes joint venture loans where they share the credit
risk with the bank. And so that does dilute the whole balance sheet reserves. So anyway, I know I kind of mixed
you up there with a couple of responses, but did I get to your question, Tyler?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. I guess, I'm just trying to understand how the dynamic with BHG and the purchasing banks are
going to play out this year. I mean, if default rates do begin to accelerate, what happens to the demand from
those purchasing banks, and conversely, I guess, BHG's willingness to make those banks whole with losses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think what they'll do is they'll continually modify their scoring models. They've told us that they've tweaked
those models a little bit. They're aimed at higher FICO scores currently, and they're not getting into any kind of
new disciplines. So they won't have to introduce new disciplines to the banks, and their track record has always
been to substitute. So I don't think they really feel that they'll have that much difficulty getting a BHG loan that's
gone through the approval process downstream into the banks. I think what BHG is going to have to do that might
be a little more of a challenge for them this year is find those higher caliber borrowers to satisfy their business
flows. And so thus far, that seems to be working just fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Tyler, let me give you a comment. And this, as you know, I think maybe your questions are unnotable
maybe, so I'm not trying to say, hey, I know this is how it's going to play out. But my belief is that, if you go back to
the way that model works, what they're doing is generating a high-quality asset that a lot of banks in this country
serve markets that don't produce that high-quality an asset nor at any acceptable volume. And so my belief is, a
lot of those smaller community banks will continue to buy that paper because it's the best asset alternative they

have. And their experience as you know is having gone through 19 years here, no bank has ever taken $1 loss on
those credits. They're highly regarded credits by these smaller banks and smaller markets. So I don't know the
answer,, and I can't guarantee what's going to happen, but my bet is that bank network will hold up very well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. I appreciate that, Terry. And I guess what we're just all trying to figure out is, as we enter a recessionary
environment and losses out of that paper potentially accelerate dramatically, does the liquidity dry up and these
banks stop buying the paper or does BHG continue to make those banks whole as they historically have to keep
that high-quality aspect of that paper, but take on significantly more losses and less profitability to do so? And
again, I hear you loud and clear that you may not know that answer, I'm talking to play out. I think that's just what
we're trying to figure out. So maybe just lastly for me then, given that said in terms of Harold's comment about
how April is trending so far, what's the underlying I guess drag on BHG's net earnings growth this year? Is it less
gain on sale margins, is it assumption for higher put back risk or losses? What's ultimately driving that lower net
earnings growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think it might be all of that. But primarily I think what they're trying to do is get prepared for maybe
additional recourse builds as well as maybe some pull back on business flows. I think they reduced their guidance
to us on where they think their loans will end up for the year. So I think it's a little bit of all of that. But I still think
they'll weather this storm pretty well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just lastly from me on expenses, just a clarification question. The earnings release talked about
low to mid single-digit expense growth relative to 2019. The slide deck talks about low to mid single-digit expense
growth relative to 4Q 2019 annualized. It's about a $20 million or so difference. So I'm just curious what the
baseline that we should be thinking about if it is 4Q 2019 annualized which is $522 million of baseline expenses to
[indiscernible] (01:10:55)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
It's 4Q 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks again, guys. I appreciate all the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. A question on the PPP program. Great to see how active you were. Can you help us think about how to
model that $50 million in fees? I'm assuming we'll see most of it in the second quarter, assuming most of it turns
into a grant. So, one on geography, do you expect it to come in the margin or in fees? And then also, how are you
thinking about how much of that will come in the second quarter versus trail off over the life of the loan? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. I wish I'd be able to answer to it. But what we're modeling is the revenue to come in
some in the late second quarter and some into the early third quarter and about 75% of the loans being, call it,
forgivable and then recognition of the fees of the remaining 20% to 25% over the next, call it, year-and-a-half after
that. Now we've asked a lot of people about how they're modeling it, and we can't really get a strong consensus
one way or the other, but that's kind of where we've taken a first stab on collection of that revenue. As far as...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q

And so you're...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
As far as fees or margin, I think, right now, we're leaning towards a fee recognition, but we'll wait to see what the
accountant say about that. It may be a margin thing. I think I'm not really sure right now to be totally positive,
Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But your margin and your fee guidance does not include anything from the PPP program then?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. And then on your reserve build, is there any way to think about how much of your reserve build
came from the higher risk categories that you work out? You gave – I guess, about 20% of your book is in the
retail CRE, hotel, restaurant. Can we think about how much of the incremental provision we saw this quarter
came from just those portfolios? Or is that too simple of a number to pull?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we know – when we ran the models, the way the modeling works is against call report
categories. And so, we don't have it allocated within the models to the various NAIC codes like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Elian Q

Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. Following up on [indiscernible] (01:14:41-01:14:48),
the willingness of these small community banks to purchase BHG loans changed at all, given the high volume of
payment deferrals going on in across the country?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

I don't – can you go back through that one more time?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

deferral activity.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
They're still able to flex every loan that they send to auction to all these community banks. There's still in high
demand with respect to the auction platform. And so, there's a lot of bid traffic on the website for it. So, they don't
believe they're seeing any diminishment in the appetite for that credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then on the 20% of high-risk loans that you called out as most impacted by the pandemic, do
you have the reserve against these loans for each of the four segments that you called out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We don't have that degree of specificity. The CECL models are built around call report categories. And so,
we don't have it broken down into the individual NAICS. And what we tried to do on the slide deck this morning
was aggregate exposure through various products. So, we've got C&I exposure, CRE exposure, all considered
within those individual slides. So, we can't really differentiate or allocate the loss exposure assigned to those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then finally for me, on deferrals, so it looks like 8 of your top 10 borrowers in hotels have requested
some sort of deferral. You mentioned about 44% of the restaurant book [indiscernible] (01:16:43-01:16:50)
deferral period ends? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A

Oh, I guess, the machine that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think the question had to do with all the deferrals that we're having, what are we hearing from our borrowers
about their ultimate ability to make payment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's right. That was my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
This is Tim Huestis. I'd say that it's still early. I think our conversations with the clients about payment deferrals
will pick up in earnest in early May as they start approaching the 60-day, with any of the clients that want another
90-day deferral will be asking for a fair amount of information from them with the purpose of trying to determine
how much of the portfolio may not make it versus those that are simply wounded. But as of this moment, we don't
really have feedback from clients on deferrals when they might be able to make payment.
