Okay. Thank you, Sergio. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us in the third quarter results
presentation. I think the results show the business momentum we are having with another solid set of results in
the Q3. The operating income pre-provision profit is growing 11% year-on-year in constant euros. Revenue was
up 8%, driven by the risk (sic) [increase] (00:00:59) in volumes, loans, deposits and mutual funds. And this comes
along with a growth in the, it cannot be the other way, increasing customers and greater digitalization that led to a
strong broad-based revenue generation, efficiency improvement and higher profitability.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Specifically going to the numbers, Q3 2021 profit was around €2.2 billion, plus 3% quarter-on-quarter in constant
euros, plus 5% in current euros on the back of some euro average depreciation. Well, the currency year-on-year
is different but in the quarter, the euro depreciate a bit against the basket of our currencies.
Nine month 2021 group attributable profit €5.9 billion, excluding Q1 extraordinary items, nine month 2021
underlying profit €6.4 billion. The numbers speak by themself. We maintain our cost discipline and solid credit
quality, the latter reflected in our cost of credit below 1%. Regarding capital, strong capital generation in the
quarter, plus 48 basis points in Q3, enable us to reach a fully-loaded core equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.85% at the top
end of our 11%-12% target range.
We continue to deliver an outstanding growth in profitability. Return on tangible equity stood at 12.6%. TNAV,
tangible net asset value, grew in the quarter and including the dividend per share rose 6.5% year-on-year. The
board, as you know, has approved a new remuneration policy for 2021 with a [ph] 50 (00:02:40) payout set at
40% underlying profit, 50% cash, 50% buyback programs. Interim distribution approximately in the region of €1.7
billion. So in short, we are well on track to outperform the full year 2021 goals that we established at the beginning
of the year and to reach our medium-term underlying return on tangible equity target in the region of 13% to 15%.
Moving to customers, what great success on digitalization has been a key driver of the revenue and net operating
income growth. We recorded a steady increase in total customers and in turn our customers are increasingly
using our products and services through contact centers, digital channels, and the branches. As a result, digital
customers rose by more than 5 million year-on-year. Digital transactions were up 39% year-on-year and grew
across all the countries between 20% and 50%.
Digital sales as a percentage of total sales stood at 54% in nine month 2021, plus 10 full percentage points year-
on-year and with growth in all products across the board, mainly in the ones related with individuals, mortgages,
consumer deposits, investments. If we look at the last quarter, digital sales reached 57% of the total. Also, and
this is important, we are top three by NPS in seven markets in which we operate.
Moving to the group's income statement, exchange rates had a small positive impact in the quarter, as I
mentioned before, but year-on-year still negative impact, minus 5 percentage points in revenue and minus 3
percentage points in costs. Looking at the results in constant euro, revenue grew, particularly customer-related
revenue.
We demonstrate a core discipline in an environment of rising inflation. Certainly, inflation is rising, particularly not
only in Argentina [indiscernible] (00:04:42) has been in the case in the last couple of years. Also in Brazil and
Mexico and Chile, we have significant inflation now in Europe. Additionally, we had a significant reduction in loan
loss provisions, although they reflected in the quarter some increase, mainly in the US.
We delivered a nine month 2021 underlying profit of €6.4 billion, plus 87% year-on-year. No extraordinary items in
the third quarter. Recall that we recorded €530 million restructuring costs in Q1. I will give you a brief overview of
the performance of each region and global business, and our CFO, José Antonio Cantera, will elaborate
[indiscernible] (00:05:28), very positive performance across all of them.
[ph] And once (00:05:32) again the US, Brazil and CIB performance is [ph] down south (00:05:35), the global
business performing very well. Wealth Management & Insurance and PagoNxt delivering according or better than
our expectations that our guidance that we gave to you, underscored as usual by our geographical and business
diversification.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Each of our three regions contributed roughly 30% to the group profit, Europe 29%, North America 29%, South
America 30%, and Digital Consumer Bank, the 12%. If we analyze the quarterly trends in core lines, sustained
and revenue growth, NII, up 1% positive performance in trading gains in Q3 and the quarter-on-quarter
comparison was favored by the Single Resolution Fund contribution in Q2.
On the other hand, net fee income remained stable, impacted by seasonality in Europe and a strong figures in
CIB, in the Corporate & Investment Banking business across the board. I will run you through these in more detail
in the following slides. Cost control in the context of higher inflation and increased expenses related with greater
activity, higher loan loss provisions mainly in the US and to a lesser extent in the UK as both had some provision
releases in Q2. As you already know in the US, LLPs tend to have some seasonality in the second half of the
year.
NII was 7% higher compared with nine month 2020 and 1% quarter-on-quarter. On the back of higher volumes,
our loans grew €8 billion in the quarter. Deposits grew €15 billion. Regarding margin management versus
previous year, we saw a general repricing of liabilities, Europe, North America and Chile, and improving loan
spreads in UK, Poland, and the US.
In addition, there was a positive impact year-on-year of the TLTRO that you know very well, and naturally no
impact on quarter-on-quarter. Finally, average interest rates remained lower than in nine month 2020 despite
increases in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico and Chile where the rates went up and recently in Poland. These
increases will positively impact NII in the coming quarters.
When we go to the fee income, we continue with the recovery from the lows in the second quarter in 2020. The
entire range of products saw higher activity levels year-on-year with some seasonality in the quarter, mainly in
Europe. You have the figures in the slide. All the activities show a greater activity. Payment volumes grew
significantly. Cars are growing. [ph] Cars are growing (00:08:35) in a significant speed. In consumer, activity
trends continue to improve with the strong signs of recovery year-on-year.
In Q3, mainly the the motor finance business has been affected by new vehicle sales that are affected, as you
know, by the shortages in the supply chain of the OEMs. And while we have a strong activity, probably the
strongest activity we have seen so far in the used vehicles space. In addition, CIB and Wealth Management &
Insurance generate a sharp increase in fee income, representing about 50% of the group's total fee income.
Wealth Management & Insurance fee grew 11% underpinned by the significant increase in assets under
management and insurance written premiums. CIB fees grew 19% on the back of very good activity in DCM, ECM
and M&A. In short, fee income recovered pre-pandemic levels across our footprint set for the UK due to
regulatory changes regarding overdraft since April 2020.
In the cost side, we continue to see – and this is new – a significant recessionary inflation in all countries,
particularly in Latin America. In these countries, group costs rose 3.7%. In real terms excluding inflation, costs
were 1% lower after [ph] a slightly higher IT expenses (00:10:01), digital developments, increased activity and
labor agreements.
Our efficiency ratio improved more than 120 basis points year-on-year to 45.6%. That is a very good number in
the industry. Mainly driven by Europe, we recorded the highest efficiency gains. In Europe, costs were 1.5%
lower, making headway in our cost reduction plan, which we expected to accelerate in the coming quarters,
increasing synergies. Of note, Spain with a 7% decreased efficiency in the region, as I mentioned before, still at
50%, having improving 7 percentage points year-on-year.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
In North America, costs increased 8%, mainly driven by technology expenses, digitalization, amortizations, and a
$50 million donation to our community foundation in the US that was recorded in the quarter. Of note were the
performance in Mexico, minus 2% in real terms, efficiency in the region still at 44%.
In South America, the increase in costs, plus 9%, was greatly distorted by the very high inflation in Argentina. In
real terms, costs declined 3% in the region, Brazil minus 6%, Chile minus 1% and Argentina was flat in real terms.
The efficiency in the region stood at 35% with continued improvement. Finally, in Digital Consumer Bank, cost
increased due to changes in perimeters, is the leasing company that we bought in Germany, Sixt Leasing, and
the joint venture in Italy that we launched this year.
Finally, loan loss provisions, well, we have a cost of credit in the last 12 months of 90 basis points in the same
period of 2020 was 1.27%. Taking into account the first nine month of the year only, the cost of risk was 83 basis
points, performing better than expected due to lower provisions in most markets, mainly in the US, Digital
Consumer Bank, Brazil and Chile, together with the net releases in the UK. The NPL ratio was virtually flat year-
on-year and slightly lower quarter-on-quarter.
Total loan loss reserves stood at €24.5 billion with a coverage ratio of 74%. In addition, I would like to remind you
that the majority of the overlay that we recorded last year is sitting on the balance sheet. We expect to make
some releases in Q4 on the back of new macro scenario, which will enable the cost of risk to reach around 80
basis points by year-end. This is our best estimation, if nothing change in our view of the macro scenario.
Finally, on capital, I would like to highlight the strong organic generation in the quarter, 48 basis points. The figure
is mainly supported by [ph] our own net (00:13:00) profit, risk weighted asset management through securitizations
mainly, neutral [ph] intra-fund (00:13:07) dividend accrual on the back of the new dividend policy that you already
know.
Additionally, we recorded 16 basis points related to regulatory and model-related capital impact, and another 17
basis points mainly market performance. All in all, the core equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 15 basis points to
11.85% on a fully loaded basis, very close to the maximum level of our range, 11% to 12%. The phased-in you
have in the slide, 12.26%.
Additionally, I would like to comment on the solid results achieved by the group in the EBA stress test. In
accordance with our expectations, we outperformed clearly our peers that show that the resilience of our business
model in scenarios, [ph] the (00:13:57) stressed scenarios. So when we go to the ratios, you have in the line the
return on tangible equity progressing well, EPS is progressing well, tangible net asset value per share is still
progressing clearly. Also noteworthy is the return on risk weighted assets will reached 1.8% versus 1% one year
ago.
Well, you already know our dividend policy. Once the ECB lifted the recommendation not to pay dividends, well,
the board approved a payout at the 40% of underlying profit. We are in interim distribution [ph] of value (00:14:42)
of €1.7 billion, well, half in cash, half in buyback. Today, around 30% of the buyback program was already
executed. So this is where we are in this regard and in our dividend policy.
Finally, going to ESG, so as you know, the bank has strong commitments to ESG. Well, we have stood for a
sustainable and inclusive growth of people and business for many years, and we continue working on improving
our financial products to support our customers in their transition towards a low-carbon economy. We have set
ambition to be net zero by 2050, being a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Among [ph] other

(00:15:35) guidelines requires the bank to set decarbonization targets for carbon intensive sectors no later than
September 2022.
In this regard, we have set and disclosed the first specific Net-Zero Banking Alliance targets for power generation
that is to reduce emissions more than by half in our power generation portfolio by 2030. In this regard, in Q3, we
joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. It's important to have general standard to harmonize all
the numbers that are being published, and we are committed to have an standard under which we publish all the
numbers related with this.
As regard to the green finance, well, as you know, we are a market leader in renewable energy. We – mobilizing
in nine months €17 billion, €51 billion since 2019.
As you know, we are a leader in financial renewals. In our core geographies, we continue to lead the renewal of
project finance league tables year-to-date, number one by number of deals by Bloomberg and top three by
volume in Dealogic.
We have issue on our long €1 billion green bonds, €3 billion total to-date as part of our sustainable debt plan.
On the social side, as having a strong presence and being the market leader in Latin America, naturally our main
goal – this is to financial empowerment strategy in the program that we call Santander Finance for All. Hence,
people [ph] are assisted (00:17:18) in the financial system, set up and grow micro business and also offers
financial education. Our microfinance initiatives have already been launched in Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay,
Colombia, and it was launched in Peru in Q3.
We have reached 6.2 million financial empowered people since 2019, of which 1.3 million are
microentrepreneurs. And we are making progress in the share of women in senior leadership position.
When it comes to governance, well, you know the board, the composition of the board, diversity in the board in
terms of independence, and also gender and diversity in all the dimensions. We also include ESG metrics in our
executive bonus scorecard.
In addition, our work in – our corporate culture, Santander Way, were reflected in the results of the year global
engagement survey where the level of employee commitment reached 80%, considerably higher than the sector
average rates.
Finally, I would like to point out that our different ESG initiatives have got significant external recognition along the
year.
I'll now hand over to José to elaborate over the different business units and regions.

José Antonio García Cantera
Group Chief Financial Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning, everyone. Like always, I will start with a brief summary of the
regions and then I will move into the main countries in the following slides.
Europe, we continue to grow our business, while we advance [ph] in a common (00:18:53) and more efficient
operating model. We had volume growth year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in almost all markets and we expect
these trends to continue in the coming quarters. This led to revenues growing strongly at 12% year-on-year. And

as José Antonio mentioned, outstanding cost management with a strong efficiency improvement, and we also had
a low cost of risk at 48 basis points. This, in turn, led to net operating income growth of 30% and doubling of
profits.
In North America, we had accelerated volumes, although US figures, as I will explain later, are affected by the
disposals in the year-on-year comparison. We had a strong profit growth year-on-year, boosted by cost of credit
improvement mainly in the US and revenue increase. Excluding disposals, revenue – total income was up 7%.
Return on tangible equity in North America was 13%.
In South America, we continue to strengthen our regional ties, reflected in solid double-digit customer and volume
growth. Profit was up 31% and return on tangible equity stood at 20%.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, we saw strong profit growth in the third quarter, leading to double-digit growth year-
on-year as well.
Now let me go into the main countries now. In Spain, the stock of loans was flat in the quarter as mortgages offset
the decrease in companies. Mortgages recorded the highest new business volumes in the last three years.
Results in the third quarter were boosted by a strong net operating performance. Revenue rose 11% in the
quarter, while costs dropped 4%. Regarding provisions, we remain cautious in Spain, but we expect the cost of
risk in 2022 to be approximately half of that of 2021.
Year-on-year revenue grew 4%, mainly driven by net fee income, especially in transactional and insurance
products. Our cost reduction efforts were reflected in a sharp fall, 7%, improvement efficiency by 6 percentage
points, while loan loss provisions remain stable. This obviously was reflected in the almost 50% growth in profit.
We expect balance sheet trends to continue in the coming quarters, which should lead to a stable net interest
income, while fee income could expand at mid-single digit rates. Cost should maintain its downward trend.
In the UK, the main trends recorded in previous quarters continued. Net interest margin kept improving, based on
deposit repricing and volume growth. The mortgage book grew 4%. As you can see in the slide, downward trend
in costs accelerated as our transformation program delivered savings, partially offset by IT investments and
regulatory related programs. As a result, the efficiency ratio improved 13 percentage points in the first nine
months of the year. We recorded another quarter of zero loan loss provisions. Return on tangible equity in the first
nine months was 11.5%.
Like in Spain, we expect balance sheet trends to continue in the coming quarters. Assuming no hikes in rates, net
interest income should stabilize, while fee income would grow at low-single digit rates. We expect to reach a cost-
to-income below 50% next year, while the cost of risk should gradually normalize.
Brazil closed another excellent quarter in terms of volumes, profit, and profitability. We maintained strong growth
rate in lending and reached a record high in card sales. We gained 1.6 million new customers just in the third
quarter.
Turning to results, profit was almost 30% higher year-on-year at €1.8 billion and return on tangible equity
increased to 22%. We had positive NII performance due to larger volumes as a slight increase in average interest
rates, while net fee income also grew in insurance and capital markets, especially. We reached record efficiency
levels with cost up 1%, while inflation was up 10% year-on-year. Loan loss provisions decreased sharply with a
very positive cost of credit performance, which fell to 3.6%, 1 percentage point less than a year ago.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
In the coming quarters, the structural double-digit volume growth rates should be maintained, which will continue
to push up net interest income and fee income. We expect to be able to keep costs growing below inflation and to
maintain cost of risk at similar levels.
In the US, the work conducted over the last several years allowed us to be uniquely positioned to benefit from
current market conditions. In volumes, loan performance was impacted by Bluestem portfolio disposal. Excluding
perimeter, growth was 2% year-on-year, with auto originations increasing 16% versus the same period of last
year.
Customer funds showed a strong performance also, growing 13%. Year-on-year performance is affected by
Puerto Rico and Bluestem disposals, so I will comment on the year-on-year results on a like-for-like basis.
Net operating income increased 17% on the back of resilient NII growth of 7%, strong auto leasing results and fee
income. At the same time, provisions decreased sharply, although we are starting to see signs of normalization.
We're very proud to announce that this quarter, Santander US donated $50 million to the Santander Consumer
Foundation in order to fund a multiyear program focused on transforming lives of low income students, young
adults and families across the country. This program will target closing the digital divide, enabling students and
families in education programs to boost digital and financial competencies.
In addition, in line with group strategy to deploy capital to the most profitable business and to accelerate growth in
the US. In the third quarter, we announced two transactions that we have already shared with you, the proposal to
acquire all outstanding shares in Santander Consumer we don't own, which is around 20% and the agreement to
acquire Amherst Pierpont Securities. Both transactions are still subject to regulatory approvals.
In the coming quarters, we expect high-single digit growth in loans, supported by consumer and CIB. Revenue
should continue to grow, driven by double-digit growth in NII, while fees may contract slightly. Cost-to-income is
expected to remain at similar levels.
In Mexico, lending started to show signs of recovery in the quarter as individuals' positive performance partially
offset corporate loan normalization. In the third quarter, NII was favored by volume growth and higher interest
rates, while fee income [ph] performance (00:25:51) was impacted by insurance seasonality in the second quarter
and lower financial advisory fees. Costs were affected by inflation, IT projects and new outsourcing legislation.
In September, cost of credit stood well below 3%. We expect NII plus fees to grow at high-single digits next year,
while cost should increase below inflation and cost of risk should remain fairly stable.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, activity trends generally continue to improve. New lending was 11% higher year-
on-year. However, in the third quarter, the microchip shortage hampered production and consequently the new
auto market, particularly in the first part of the quarter. Despite ease in terms of total income, September was the
best month of the year-to-date, driving the strongest quarter since 2019, thanks to recovering fees in Germany
and a strong consumer lending and flat used vehicle volumes. This, together with 3% volume cost and the SRF
contribution in the second quarter, resulted in a 32% increase quarter-on-quarter in underlying profits.
For the coming quarters, we expect a strong cyclical growth in consumer finance demand. Cost-to-income should
remain below 40% and cost of risk should gradually normalize.

Turning to the global businesses, in Corporate & Investment Banking, we held leading positions in the rankings of
Structured Finance in Europe and South America, and DCM and ECM in most countries where we operate. We
are one of the world leaders in financing and advising on renewable energy.
Outstanding third quarter results shown by revenues, which was up 12% year-on-year, and the efficiency ratio
remained a benchmark in this sector at below 38%. Loan loss provisions started to normalize as well.
In Wealth Management, total assets under management increased double digits year-over-year. Commercial
flows year-to-date in Private Banking and Santander Asset Management reached €14 billion. These flows account
for more than 3% of total volume managed. In Insurance, gross written premiums rose 5% year-over-year. In
summary, total fee income generated, which includes the part accounted for in the commercial networks, grew
11%, and total contribution to the group profit increased 16% year-over-year.
Now, turning to PagoNxt in nine months, revenue increased 41% year-on-year, boosted by the strong jump in
fees, 45% and at constant exchange rates. We are clearly on track to achieve our expected second half revenue
growth of close to 50% versus the first half and to reach €1 billion of revenue in the medium term.
Now, talking about the three components of PagoNxt starting with Merchant Solutions, Getnet continued to deliver
a significant growth. The number of active merchants and total payments volume grew across all geographies.
Getnet Brazil continued to increase market share in the country, reaching 16% in total and over 30% in e-
commerce. We are developing an integrated offer for European customers with Getnet Europe, and the
integration of Wirecard's technology assets and talent acquired last January. All in all, we reached a total of 1.2
million active merchants and a total payment volume of €81 billion in the nine months, up 53% year-on-year.
In Trade, our initiatives to support our clients in international trend to expand beyond their domestic markets
continue to evolve favorably. OneTrade already connects our customers in eight countries, reaching 7,300 active
customers from 4,100 in March 2021, an 80% increase in the last six months. Ebury already has over 15,000
corporate customers, growing over 500 new companies per month. Revenues growing at over 20% versus the
first quarter.
Finally, in Consumer Solutions, Superdigital began to operate in Argentina in the third quarter.
So looking forward, we expect revenue in PagoNxt to continue to grow strongly, in line with 2021, which puts us
on track to achieve the €1 billion revenue target in the medium term. Lastly, we expect to reach more than 2
million active merchants in the medium term.
And to finalize, let me now go over the Corporate Centre. Underlying attributable loss of €1.6 billion in the first
nine months is higher than last year due to lower gains on financial transactions. Remember that we had positive
foreign currency hedging results in 2020.
On the other hand, we have no material differences in NII and costs, and significantly lower provisions due to
charges in the first nine months of last year for certain holdings whose valuation was affected by the crisis.
And now, let me turn it back to the CEO for his final remarks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Thank you, José. Once again, I think we are presenting to you a solid results in the third quarter, consistent
across geographies and business, and supported by the [ph] RoRWA (00:31:19) metrics: volume growth that
translate into higher revenue, efficiency improvement, credit is quality solid and better credit quality. We continue
to build capital.
And finally, our return on tangible equity is now clearly higher than our cost of equity. As a result of this strength
and following the lifting of the decision of the ECB recommendation, we resume our dividend policy.
And we continue to focus on improving our profitability, while helping our customers and the society in general.
We aim to grow our customer base – I should say keep growing our customer base, strengthen the loyalty by
improving their satisfaction, help them in digitalization, support them in financing and growing their businesses in
a sustainable way with a positive impact for the whole society.
In short, we are seeing a business normalization and our strength underpin our great confidence in our profitable
growth ahead. For that reason, we are confident to continue to show progress towards our medium-term target
return on tangible equity 13% as I said at the beginning of this presentation.
Thank you very much for your attention. And now we open the call for questions that you may have.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [ph] Thank you, sir (00:32:52). Thank you. The first one is coming from the line of Alvaro Serrano from
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed, sir.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on capital and maybe if you can provide some
guidance. And José, you've provided already quite a detailed guidance on the P&L. But on capital, as we think
about 2022 as well, can you maybe give us some guidance on what remaining headwinds that we passed, the
bulk of the headwind now for several years or is there anything remaining? And any thoughts on Basel IV if that's
an additional impact or not?
And then, I had another question on costs. You've given the €1 billion sort of guidance – you gave that €1 billion
cost-cutting guidance in Europe. Costs in the group were slightly higher in the quarter. I wonder if you can give us
your thoughts on [indiscernible] (00:33:57) and particularly in the UK. And why is it proving so difficult to cut costs
in the UK? It feels like it's been years now since we've been discussing the cost plans in the UK not delivering.
What's proving so difficult and do you think you can get to that €1 billion target? Thank you.

Okay. I could address the cost issue and I pass to the CFO the capital question that if he can elaborate in more
detail.
On the cost issue and particularly you're referring specifically to the cost cutting in Europe, we commit €1 billion
nominal reduction in closing the four core business: Spain, UK, Portugal and Poland. We are progressing while –
in Spain and Portugal. In UK, we are a bit behind. But I do think that we are at a running rate. This year, we're
going to be at a running rate of €600 million nominal cost reduction and for next year, well, I remain confident that
we can reach the €1 billion cost cutting. The lack in the UK is mainly due to some compliance investments that we
are making and these forced us to make these investments. But we remain committed to deliver the €1 billion that
we told you by 2022.

José Antonio García Cantera A
Group Chief Financial Officer, Banco Santander SA
Well, with regards to capital, so this year, we don't expect any more regulatory charges. For next year, we'll have
a small impact from minorities and we will have some impact from updating the models, but this should be
significantly smaller than the impacts we had in 2021. So, we would expect to be at the upper end of the range
throughout the year.
On Basel III (sic) [Basel IV] (00:35:50), well, we need to see the final legislation. We've seen a draft that was
leaked a few days ago with ILM equal to 1. If this is confirmed and the treatment of equity stakes and some other
smaller changes, the impact on Santander is going to be very small. As you know, we will not be affected by the
output floor. So with ILM equal to 1 and some other adjustments, I think the impact will be really small.

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first question comes on Spain NII and how do you
see trends, pricing and volumes going forward? This would be one. The other would be to touch a little bit on the
US and how do you see the franchise long term without the agreement with Fiat developing? Thank you very
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. NII in Spain, well, let's talk where the market is right now. We see a significant activity – good activity in the
individual space, mortgage and consumer lending. Good activity in this front. Not that good in the corporate sector
where the demand for trade is relatively low.
So the NII has been affected largely, as we know very well, by the level of Euribor, assuming that the Euribor
remained what it is with an NII that is going to be in line with what we are showing today. So assuming that the
Euribor remains naturally, [ph] we are – the integrates are (00:37:44) the balance sheet with the ALCO positions
being very small [ph] or nonexistent is – the position was (00:37:50) higher rates.

On the US, you ask specific about the franchise [ph] SCUSA signed (00:38:00), the franchise with – the
agreement of Chrysler. Well, Chrysler, the agreement expires in 2023, but this doesn't mean that we do not
continue to do business with Chrysler.
As you know, Chrysler bought [indiscernible] (00:38:16), but is going to take for a while before they got – they are
able to underwrite the whole business, particularly in the subprime and near-prime space where we are a real
specialist and we expect to keep significant part of the business.
On top of that, we are diversifying out of Chrysler. Naturally, we have now like three different providers. One is
what we call [ph] internally core (00:38:44) business and it is the additional subprime that we generate in our own
that is the bulk of the business. And the other is Chrysler in which we have the prime, the near-prime and the
subprime, and the accounts from Chrysler. The prime normally we dispose 100% of them or the majority of them,
and we keep normally the near-prime and subprime where we are a specialist.
Going forward, I do expect some impact from this, but not being very significant and not change the dynamic of
the franchise, mainly taking into account that we are and for sure, we're going to get agreements with other
originators, be in digital originators, as we are working already with them, or be in traditional originators or other
OEMs that may substitute some of the volumes we are getting now from Chrysler.

Francisco Riquel Q

Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is a general question about Brazil. The bank in Brazil is
performing very well, delivering RoTE above 20%. However, the macro risks are increasing, with inflation running
up north of 10%. Concerns on fiscal spending driving [indiscernible] (00:40:04) up, GDP growth expectations
revised down for 2022. So in this context, the general question is how do you see the main KPIs in Brazil in the
current macro environment, mainly the [indiscernible] (00:40:16) margins, the costs, and the cost of risk?
And the second question is about the other revenue lines. If you can explain what do you – more details on what
you include here in this €500 million in the third quarter, particularly in Spain, which was much higher than
expected and also in the consumer businesses and Digital Consumer Bank in the US. If you can comment also
on the nature of these revenues, whether they are recurrent or not. Thank you.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Okay, thank you for your question. Brazil, you asked [indiscernible] (00:40:51) question on Brazil, let me to
make two starting points. One, we are performing well in Brazil, as you recognize, on the back of market share
gains. We are gaining market share across the board, but mainly in the retail space – credit cards, insurance
businesses – mainly those business that – well, on the lending side. And there is a mix effect. [ph] We are not
(00:41:18) growing that much at this stage. Now, on the corporate side, we are growing mainly in the retail.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
You mentioned a – what you call – I don't know how do you qualify the macro environment having higher risk on
the back of the fiscal policy and all. This is – well, the inflation [indiscernible] (00:41:38) is – naturally has been
growing significantly. On the back of this, the central bank is increasing rate, as you know, and probably continue
to do so. And the prospects for the inflation are not – is to come back a certain level. Is not different than the
expectations we have in the mature markets that inflation now is running high and we'll come back in – at some
point.
You asked specifically a question how this affect our KPIs going forward, this macro environment, and the cost of
risk and all these things. I do not expect a material impact in the cost of risk, other than one reflected that comes
from the mix. Yeah. Naturally, the cost of risk as a total probably is going to be higher on the back of having the
retail business growing in high-double digit and the corporate business growing probably mid-single digit or a bit
high, but significantly lower than the other. So, other than these items, you see a significant impact coming from
this side.
The critical question here is our capacity to keep the momentum in the business and being a real market leader in
the way we are doing the digital transformation. So, what – our commercial activities is going very well and as a
matter of fact, we are about to reach 1 million credit card sales per month. That is a – quite a number. Comparing
that, we were probably one year and a half ago, two years ago in half of this, 0.5 million or less than.
So the growth, we have high confidence in keeping our business momentum, our commercial activity with good
control operation. Naturally, environment is going to be volatile because we face elections next year and some
volatility may be expected around elections, presidential elections next year, and some measures could be taken
looking at elections next year.
On the other revenue line, mainly Spain, I think is equity method. Yeah. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Group Chief Financial Officer, Banco Santander SA
Under deposit guarantee and the contributions to the SRF in the second quarter. So, it's the volatility associated
with both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
So, there are some businesses in – that we account by equity method that are going back to normal. And
probably you should expect this line to keep growing, yeah, in a sustainable basis because those are business
that – well, some of you know the [ph] Merlins (00:44:20) in Spain and the likes that you know that – well, given
the economic scenario, we expect this to keep growing in the coming years.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Hi there. Good morning. Adrian Cighi from Credit Suisse. Two follow-up questions from my side: one on Brazil
and one on capital. On Brazil, we see NII increase in the quarter by 8.5% in euro terms. My understanding is that
the first year impact of rate increases, which you reiterate again is a negative impact of €63 million from 100 basis
points rate increase. This year, the central bank has increased rates by over 400 basis points.
Are we seeing the impact of these increased rates in these results, i.e., is the underlying results even stronger or
are these rate increase impacts somewhat delayed and should we expect them in the coming quarters? We're
clearly in the middle of a very aggressive cycle. So, any insight on how the timing and quantum of impacts from
these would be much appreciated.
Sticking with Brazil, we've seen some pretty big moves in FX in recent weeks. Can you update us where your
hedging is on this? And briefly on capital, you had 17-basis-point headwinds in the market and others. Can you
give us any color as to what drove this given that there are some relatively limited spread movement this quarter?
Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Allow me to take first the question in Brazil. I will pass [ph] hedge question (00:45:58) to the CFO, and I will
elaborate also on the [ph] capital changes to (00:46:06) market.
Brazil, you – I'll say while we have a negative impact when the rate goes up, that's true in the short run. In one
year, it's minus €63 million or 100 basis points. We increased [ph] 4 (00:46:25) – you said we see the rates
increasing 400 basis points. That's true. But when you look at the numbers and the volumes, what you see is the
volumes in retail with very high margins growing close to 20%, okay?
The mix effect is very strong. We translate this into 11% growth in NII. We are missing here like-for-like we should
be growing the margin in the region of close to 20% year-on-year. We are growing 11% and partially due to this
increase in rates that you rightly pointed that affect us in a negative way.
I should say that the €63 million is on one year. Probably you take this quarter-on-quarter. The impact is more
negative at the beginning and less negative as the time goes, and we are able to [ph] re-appreciate (00:47:16)
assets and liabilities. But the effect that you mentioned is due to this.
I pass the question [ph] to hedge the capital (00:47:24). The market is basically mark-to-market at a value of for-
sale portfolio. The impacts we have had in Brazil, Mexico [ph] somehow (00:47:35) and US, yeah? So...

José Antonio García Cantera A
Group Chief Financial Officer, Banco Santander SA
...Brazil and Chile in the region of €500 million each from the beginning of the year. So, this explains basically the
impact on capital.
In terms of the hedging, well, we continue to hedge the capital ratio. So, FX movements do not affect the capital
ratio and we continue to hedge expected profits of – when we think that the market is running ahead of itself. So,
now we have some currencies already hedged for next year and again, this is tactically and it depends on our
view of the market relative to what the market expects. But again, the most important is the hedging of capital,
which we continue to do. So the ratio continues to be fully hedged.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Yeah, it's Sofie from JPMorgan. So just had two follow-up questions. Just the first one, going back to
Brazil net interest income, I get that you have the mix effect. But if I look at the loan growth in Brazilian terms, loan
growth was up only 2% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. But net interest income was up 5% quarter-on-
quarter in Brazil. I was wondering did you have any increased ALCO performance in Brazil or something else
that's going to help the net interest income in Brazil or it is purely the mix effect.
And then my second question would also be a follow-up question. I recognized that on the regulatory front, you
were saying that next year the regulatory impact will be less. But could you just remind us how much all the
minorities are, Amherst Pierpont? Is there anything else that we should be aware of in terms of [indiscernible]
(00:49:54) equity Tier 1 impact outside the regulatory impacts? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. I'm going to Brazil. The other issue on top of the mix and the different path of growth between retail and
corporate business is the ALCO portfolio, yeah, so naturally, as the ALCO portfolio now is much smaller than NIIs,
much smaller than it was. And even the size is smaller. And the spread, the spread is smaller. So, those are the
two components, yeah. So this – yeah, so no more than that.
On the regulatory front, I pass the question to José.

So, this year, we have the – well, again, this is subject to regulatory approval still. But the Amherst Pierpont
impact will be around 9 basis points. The buyback of SCUSA minorities will be 10 basis points. If we get the
regulatory approvals before the year-end, we will account for those this year.
In terms of pure regulatory charges next year, the change in the accounting of minorities will be another 10 basis
points next year, which is the only significant regulatory impact that we expect next year. On top of that, again, we
will have new models which could cost us a bit of capital, but again, when we look at the sum of regulatory plus
models next year relative to 2021 will be significantly smaller.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Hello. Thank you for the presentation. Have a couple of questions. One is on Stellantis. You've already
touched on the impact in Europe, but it's really reported that they are in the process of reassessing partnerships in
Europe, and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit on that from where are you in the negotiations and if
there's any – did you see any risk of losing some of those joint ventures or any of the part of relationship with
them?
And secondly, if you have considered a different approach to capital allocation in the group? And if not, why not?
Because running with a tight capital ratio versus the market perception could be preventing the stock from really
[ph] rerating (00:52:30) further and perhaps unlocking some capital somewhere else in the group, even if
[indiscernible] (00:52:37) earnings could help you to run with a more comfortable capital buffer that the market
may reward. And if you don't agree with that view, why is that? It'd be nice. I know it's an open question, but it'll be
good to hear your thoughts. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Taking the question, the first one, Stellantis, the partnership in Europe, naturally, we are talking to them.
And, well, we are, I would say, fairly optimistic on continuing the existing relationship and [ph] may be the case
that we (00:53:07) continue to be the preferred partner for them or I do expect to be continued to be the preferred
partner for them in the coming years.
So, I do not expect any material change on this. If any, I think it should be positive. And on the back of the
performance of the joint ventures, yeah, so it's not other thing. So, when we started the joint ventures with them,
the joint ventures were making €250 million net profit. Now they are making more than €500 million net profit on
the back of this excellent, outstanding performance, and we expect this to continue going forward.
You mentioned capital. Well, our view is different. So, the board took the position. Our target on capital is 11%
and 12%. Well, you say more comfortable. I'm comfortable with the capital. We're going to be – we are close to
the upper end of the range and are absolutely comfortable with these for two reasons. Yeah. When I look at the
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
market, I look at the credit side, our CDS is the lowest in Europe, yeah, among the largest bank so from the credit
standpoint of view, no need.
When you look at their stress test, our score in the stress test is by far lower under the stress test scenario. So,
that's sustained our view why we should be in the 11%, 12%. And we are already at the upper end of the range,
and we plan to remain there. Yeah. And we will be at the end of the year, and next year, we will be around this.
So, that's the view. And, José, you want to add something?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Group Chief Financial Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. No, just a couple of comments. Amongst the largest banks in Europe, we are the bank with the lowest
capital requirement of all. And our MDA CET1 buffer stands today at 340 basis points. So, being capital-scarce
resource and the most expensive one, I think, José Antonio has said it all. But, again, we are the bank with the
lowest capital requirement amongst the largest in Europe.

Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One, just clarification on the comments you made on the cost
of risk into Q4 and I think you mentioned a release of provisions and that that would lower the provision charge, if
I understood correctly, to 80 basis points for the full year compared to 90 basis points as of September. So, I just
wanted to clarify that.
And then just maybe again on capital, you've indicated you're at the high end of your range, not expecting too
much change on that in Q4. But with lower regulatory headwinds in 2022 and given your guidance on profitability,
I'm just wondering maybe can you not be more specific on why the CET1 ratio wouldn't be moving above that
range that you've given. Or is it that those higher profits are being offset by higher RWA growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay, let's address the two questions. The first one is the cost of risk. I said in the presentation that we need to
update our macro scenario. The overlay that we made last year remains in the balance sheet at – and this in the
region of €2.5 billion has two components. One is coming from the macro scenario. The other one comes from
qualitative assessment of the different portfolios.
When we update the macro scenario in the fourth quarter, I don't have the [ph] current (00:57:10) number, but I
guess that the majority of the provision related with the macro scenario in the region of €700 million to €1 billion
may be released in the fourth quarter assuming that the scenario is what we have in mind right now, and this will
lead to the cost of risk in the whole year in the region of 80 basis points that I mentioned before.
The second question is on capital. Well, when we look at the capital, we have a range that we and the board, and
within that is the right range for the bank for the perception we have about the risk that the bank is facing. And
17


Banco Santander SA

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
remember that looking forward, naturally, you mentioned risk weighted assets and potential capital ratio going
beyond 12%. This may happen naturally, because the capital generation given our expectations on the return on
tangible equity is going to be significant.
At the same time, we continue to see the bank as – we expect to grow. So, I do expect in the emerging markets to
keep deploying capital, growing the business, while I don't see any reason why we shouldn't grow in Latin
America, more than 10% a year, in Europe probably less so. And on average having a risk weighted assets
growth on the region of, I don't know, 6%, 7%, 5% higher than the one we have had in the last two or three years.
And, well, if we are right, our return on tangible equity in the region of 13% to 15% allow us to [ph] combine a pay
(00:58:55) a healthy dividend and, at the same time, to grow the risk weighted assets significantly more than we
did.
And, finally, we are not growing a lot the space and naturally the ratio will grow beyond the 12% and, in that case,
it's up to the board to take the appropriate decisions in relation with capital. But to me, the capital, we have still
some regulatory and models [indiscernible] (00:59:21) in 2022, beyond 2022, Basel III for us is not an issue at all.
We don't have impact of the output floor, if the [ph] ALM comes equal to one (00:59:30) operational risk is not
going to be an issue for us.
And I will say we will have a clear sky to navigate in with a risk weighted asset growth in the region of medium to
high-single-digit growing and rewarding, having a consistent dividend policy that our shareholders, particularly
retail ones, like very much [ph] too with paying (01:00:00) cash, yeah?

Hi. Good morning. My first question is related to NII in Spain. You mentioned that you expect NII stability going
forward. What are the assumptions regarding [indiscernible] (01:00:26) embedded in this stability for NII in Spain?
Are you assuming that the current conditions will remain in place for the whole year 2022?
And then a more general question on the return target, I know that you have a midterm time guideline for the
target. Would it be possible to give some indication for next year perhaps on the RoTE target? Or maybe if you
can give us some indication about whether you expect RoTE to continue improving versus 2021 yeah level?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
So NII in Spain, the conditions we are assuming are the current ones. So I am not assuming a increase in rates in
the cards. So I'm assuming that we navigate more or less on average with the same level that this year. You know
the Euribor one year is the one who has the largest impact, well, not only, okay. So in general, as you know, we
don't have ALCO positions in Spain, so our position to higher rates is pretty, pretty strong, probably the strongest
18


Banco Santander SA

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
we have had in many, many years. But what is on the back of my projections is 2022 and rates being similar to
2021. If those are lower, it affects my projection. If those are higher, it will be up, big, big positive.
Return on tangible equity, I do expect that return on tangible equity in 2022 being higher than the one in 2021.
Yeah. So it's not our policy at this point to give guidance to you. But while you can project easily, you see trends
in our business and some indications that we gave you, particularly on provision in Spain, where the cost of risk is
going to be significantly, significantly lower. And José already gave you an indication of where we expect to
navigate on this. You can make your own numbers and you get easily into what may be the development of the
group next year. Yeah. But [ph] for sure (01:02:45), I do expect higher return on tangible equity in 2022 than in
2021.

Thank you for taking my questions. You have given some detail on the reversals you expect lower [ph] late
(01:03:08) provisions, can you tell us where you expect them? And I may have missed if you have given
indications on guidance on where the cost of risk outlook is going in the US?
I don't know if you could share with us if you expect any impact from IFRS 17 implementation. [ph] And next
(01:03:29) on capital, is the impact from the implementation of the addendum rules over with what you've taken
this quarter and from the important securitization activity that you're having, should we expect a negative impact in
the future on NII? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The guidance cost of risk in Spain were – particularly less in Spain. This year we've been – oh sorry, I don't
know if you were hear me. I don't know the mic was off or on. Sorry. The guidance of cost of risk in Spain, we
expect lower cost of risk in the SME space. I made these comments in the previous quarters that we were taking
a prudent view on the SME portfolio in Spain.
So as you've seen, we've been building a significant amount of provisions this year in relation with all the events
that have happened around the pandemia and on all the lending related with SMEs, and we expect this to come
materially down next year once we feel comfortable with what the evolution of the macro and the expected losses
that we have already in our balance sheet for future expected events on the credit side.
You mentioned also the US cost of risk, the US cost of risk this year was starting [ph] at low (01:04:58), this next
year is going to go up. It's not going to go up at the levels we've seen before because still the environment is
helpful and the situation of the motor industry with the used car price being at very high levels probably make us
to be more optimistic than what is the average across the cycle for 2022. But it's going to go up, no doubt,
compared with this year.

You mentioned securitization being negative. Securitization, we use this traditionally as a tool of funding. In the
last two or three years, it's a combination of funding plus capital. So, the market is in a situation in which we are
doing securitizations and release capital at incredibly low implicit cost of equity, as low as 2% or something like
that, yeah. If the market remains in this situation, probably we're going to be relatively or very active in
securitizations, particularly on the consumer portfolios, where the market is eager to buy this kind of portfolios and
implicit capital costs when new securitization is extremely low. It's not the same for all the assets. José, you want
to add something?

Yeah. In terms of IAS 17, that refers to leases, if I understand correctly, and we are not aware that there will be

leasing accounting. Thank you.

follow-up. Thank you.
