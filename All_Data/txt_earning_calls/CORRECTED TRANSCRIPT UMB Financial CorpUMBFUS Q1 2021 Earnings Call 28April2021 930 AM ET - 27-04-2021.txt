Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I hope you and your families remain safe and
healthy. First quarter was a great start to 2021. We had strong balance sheet growth supported by stable diverse
funding sources, continued fee income momentum, and solid asset quality metrics. All core elements of our
investment thesis delivered on a consistent basis.
Consumer sentiment is slowly returning to more normalized levels and our customers remain cautiously
optimistic. Modified loan balances are now close to zero, and we've seen debit and credit card spend returning to
pre-pandemic levels. Operationally, it's status quo as most of our non-branch associates remain remote. Majority
of our branches reopened with regular hours earlier this month and traffic continues to be normal as expected.
Turning to our first quarter results, net income was $92.6 million or $1.91 per share and pre-tax, pre-provision
income on an FTE basis was $108.7 million or $2.24 per share. You may have noticed, our quarterly deck has
been updated with a refreshed look and additional information. We listened to the feedback from many of you and
have a concise quarterly financial section, followed by more details on our various businesses, showing metrics
and drivers in each. And a longer-term view of metrics supporting our investment thesis is included for those who
may not know our story as well.
Slide 17 shows the primary drivers behind our results, and I'll provide some high-level comments then turn it over
to Ram for more detail. Net interest income was essentially flat from the fourth quarter as the positive impact from
strong balance sheet growth was mitigated by lower loan fees and PPP income, as well as the day count in the
quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased 11.6% despite the challenging interest rate
environment. Our track record of relative outperformance in asset growth and the opportunities we see to
continue bode well for our ability to grow net interest income over time as we gain market share in many of our
unpenetrated markets and verticals.
Fee income for the quarter was impacted largely by swings in investment security gains and losses. In the first
quarter, the valuation of our position in Tattooed Chef drove a $16.1 million mark-to-market unrealized loss
compared to the $108.8 million fourth quarter gain. Excluding market fluctuations, there were some bright spots
as we continue to focus on growth in fee income.
Trust and securities processing income increased 8% from the fourth quarter and nearly 17% on a year-over-year
basis. The businesses that drive that line have experienced solid growth, benefiting from both market appreciation
and new sales activity.
In fund services, assets under administration now stand at $345 billion compared to $252 billion a year ago.
Specialty corporate trust launched internationally during the quarter, opening an office in Dublin, which is a top
economic center for structured finance. We're excited about the potential for growth this adds to our aviation trust
business, as well as opportunities to expand our offerings in other business lines.
We are also eagerly anticipating the potential for increased spending related to the proposed infrastructure bill,
which could be a great opportunity for both our underwriting and corporate trust fee business. Our Investor
Solutions team continues to focus on growth in fintech clients, with opportunities to provide FDIC Sweep and
faster custody services, among others. We added four fintech relationships in 2020 and have an active pipeline.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
And we're seeing some traction from recent investments in our Private Wealth space, where we've added
reporting and trading capabilities for a variety of investment types.
During the quarter, we brought on a new CIO for our family office business and look forward to developments
there. On the digital front, we've seen increasing use of our online account opening and mobile offering. 20% of
non-mortgage loan applications and 22% of new retail deposit accounts were initiated online in the first quarter.
General engagement with online banking is up nearly 16% from first quarter last year, which shows that people
are using our digital tools to track, monitor, and transact their accounts. After several years of investing in
customer-facing application, our digital capabilities are competitive and we are now focusing on growth and
penetration. And while we've had new delivery channels as industry dynamics have shifted, we haven't forgotten
the importance of connecting with our customers.
Moving to the balance sheet, we once again posted strong loan growth with an 8.4% linked quarter annualized
increase in average balances, excluding PPP. Slide 23 is a snapshot of our diverse loan portfolio followed by
quarterly loan activity.
In CRE, we're seeing traction in our expansion markets. Growth in C&I came from a variety of industries this
quarter, including materials and commodities, technology and commercial services. Additionally, our success in
building our mortgage capabilities has continued, as evidenced by the nearly 7% increase in average residential
mortgage loans from the fourth quarter of 2020, which are included in the consumer real estate line on the
balance sheet.
New originations for the quarter were $689 million, outside of PPP balance changes, with payoffs and paydowns
of 3% of loans. Looking into the second quarter, we see a robust pipeline in both C&I and CRE, despite some
uncertainty related to the COVID trends and the status of reopening in various markets. Given what we know
today, it's reasonable to expect our strong momentum and market opportunity should continue.
Our core deposit growth continued, driven by our institutional business along with the seasonal build-up of public
funds and the impact of the recent stimulus payments. Average balances increased 7.5% on a linked-quarter
basis and 28.8% compared to the first quarter of 2020. DDA growth helped drive the cost of total deposits to just
10 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 16 basis points.
Our average loan-to-deposit ratio, while typically much lower than our peers, was 61% for the quarter. Our
differentiated customer base, which drives diverse sources of funding and revenue, comes with larger deposit
balances. Ram will provide more detail about how we're managing our liquidity position in this environment.
On slide 25, we've updated our exposure to sensitive industries. As we moved further through the pandemic,
we've adjusted this list to reflect both the characteristics of our portfolio and the evolving outlook for various
categories. Changes this quarter include the removal of oil and gas based on our borrower performance and
stabilizing oil prices and Student Housing CRE where industry occupancy levels are improving.
Loans in the three remaining categories totaled $1.4 billion or 9.2% of loans, excluding PPP. After our typical
analysis of mitigating factors, including strong sponsors and guarantors, we feel that approximately $765 million,
or 5.1% of loans, could possibly carry more risk in a prolonged crisis. As always, we remain in close contact with
these borrowers.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
At the bottom of the page, you'll see that our modified loan balances have continued to decline, ending the quarter
at just $14 million, under [ph] one-half of 1% (00:09:58) of loans.
On the credit front, net charge-offs averaged just 13 basis points of loans, while levels of non-performing assets
improved from the end of the prior period. As we noted last quarter, improving macroeconomic conditions and the
continued quality of our loan portfolio drove the $7.5 million negative provision. As the economic backdrop
continues to normalize and business conditions improve, additional releases may be warranted. Total allowance
for credit losses on loans stand at $202.8 million, with an allowance to loan coverage of 1.23%. Excluding PPP
loans, that coverage is 1.34%.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and I'm excited about the opportunity we see in the
remainder of 2021 and beyond. Our 2020 Corporate Citizenship Report has just been published and is available
on our website. It highlights our continued efforts and actions related to the environmental, social, and corporate
governance issues. We continually adapt to find the right balance of implementing sustainable business practices,
building diverse teams, meeting obligations, and using our resources to do good. This balance has helped guide
our response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for a few comments. Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Net interest income of $194 million was comparable to the prior quarter and included
approximately $13 million in loan income from PPP balances. On a linked-quarter basis, NII levels were flat as the
benefits from earning asset growth were mitigated by the impact of two fewer days, as well as lower loan fees.
Loan yields were 3.75% compared to 3.78% in the fourth quarter and total earning asset yields decreased 21
basis points to 2.74%, due largely to the $1.8 billion of increased liquidity. Our Fed account, reverse repo and
cash balances averaged $4.5 billion in the first quarter, comprising 14% of average earning assets and yield of 32
basis points compared to $2.6 billion or 9% of earning assets and 45 basis points in the fourth quarter.
The excess liquidity buildup reflects seasonal inflows from our public funds and other businesses as well as the
benefits from federal stimulus programs. The 19 basis points decline in net interest margin on a linked-quarter
basis was driven largely by excess liquidity. If those balances had remained consistent with prior quarter, our
reported net interest margin would have been 16 basis points higher.
Additionally, if the liquidity levels were consistent with historical averages from pre-pandemic levels, our margin
would be approximately 30 basis points higher. As Mariner mentioned, our business model makes our experience
unique. The seasonality of funding from our municipal clients and large institutional volumes, including in our
aviation trust business, add variability to our liquidity positions.
Besides funding loan growth opportunities, we continue to deploy a portion of this liquidity as well as cash flows
from our securities portfolio to increase our AFS portfolio footings, as evidenced by the $2 billion increase in these
balances from last year. During the quarter alone, we purchased $1.3 billion of securities that yielded 1.42%.
Given the excess money supply in the system, our near-term focus will remain on deploying these funds prudently
and patiently with a focus to increase net interest income.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Looking ahead, the margin trajectory will largely depend on the levels of liquidity, pace and timing of PPP
forgiveness, and reinvestment rates on cash flows in the securities portfolio. Overall, we would expect some
modest margin pressure in the second quarter.
Noninterest income was $108.9 million for the first quarter and contained a $16.1 million pre-tax loss on the
valuation of our TTCF investment, which was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on equity and other
holdings, and $4.3 million in gain from the previously noted sale of Prairie Capital Management at the end of
March.
Additionally, COLI income decreased $4.4 million with its typical offset in reduced compensation expense. The
details of our various fee income lines are shown on slide 21, and Mariner commented on some of the growth
opportunities we have seen in several of those businesses.
On the expense side, we saw a reduction of $25.9 million from the elevated levels we discussed in the fourth
quarter. Legal and consulting expenses moderated from the prior quarter and incentive compensation declined,
partially offset by the seasonal increase in FICA, insurance and 401(k) expense.
The tax rate was 15.4% for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we anticipate it will be approximately between 15%
to 17%. We continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total risk-based capital at 14.28%, CET1 ratio at
12.25%, and leverage ratio at 8.08%. Our tangible book value per share increased 12.2% during the last 12
months to $57.26 at March 31.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
I guess just the first question, Ram, sticking with net interest income. One, to clarify your guidance for modest
pressure in 2Q is, I'm assuming, for the GAAP margin. And secondarily, just talk to us in terms of how you're
thinking about cash deployment. Do you see some of the deposit liquidity leaving the bank? And if not, like do you
expect to operate with this elevated liquidity levels in the near-term? Just give us your thought process around
managing liquidity versus investing in the [ph] bond book (00:17:03)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Ebrahim. It's Mariner.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll start with some high level sort of background information and Ram can talk about our deployment strategies
and the things we're doing. I think the first thing I'd say is the whole industry, obviously, is dealing with excess
liquidity between stimulus and PPP. We're all sitting on a lot of liquidity. For UMB, in addition to that, we have a
pretty decent sized institutional book of business, which also is carrying excess liquidity at this time.
So, the thing about – well – we monitor this, not only is it sticking around but it's growing. So on a year-over-year
basis, we're up 30% in deposits and that's really hard [ph] hit (00:17:59), no matter what you do to keep up with
that. And so that's kind of the backdrop. And I would say, we – yes, oftentimes [ph] people say (00:18:08) what
are you doing about that liquidity as if we're not doing something about it, but you have to also recognize, yeah,
we have industry leading loan growth.
So, I feel we're doing a pretty good job of deploying it in general and it's a tough thing to keep up with. We are
doing several things. And I'll ask Ram here to tell you what we're doing about it on a go-forward and perspective
basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Ebrahim, [ph] as we said (00:18:39) in the prepared comments, right? So we have been pretty active
in deploying this liquidity. You can see it in our balance sheet. Our AFS portfolio is up about $2 billion from a year
ago. And just in the fourth or – the first quarter alone, we bought about $1.3 billion of securities, both mortgage-
backed and some munis as well. So we are being very active in deploying this. And we're also looking at other
options, given some of this liquidity is going to be here to stay with us until another six to eight quarters. So we
are overbuying bonds in excess of what our cash flows from our securities portfolio is doing.
And then at the margin, true to what our UMB culture is, we'll also do investment options like we'll buy small pools
of mortgage loans. I'm not talking anything big, $100 million, $150 million. We're doing tri-party reverse repos.
And then when available, we've done $25 million to $50 million in a diversified pool of sub-debt of other banks. So
we continuously evaluate all the options in front of us, so that we can deploy this liquidity, so that a lot of this
liquidity [ph] isn't (00:19:42) earning 10 basis points at the Fed account. But, yeah, we are really active and
looking at different options to deploy this liquidity.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
And then the first part of your question, just to clarify, yes, on a GAAP margin basis, some modest pressure in the
second quarter. But to round out this conversation, at the end of the day, we're really confident between our loan
growth and what we're doing on the securities portfolio with the deployment that net interest income should be a
differentiated story, and that's our investment thesis, as we've highlighted in our investor deck.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I said that last quarter, I mean, it's NII right now. In this interest rate environment, we really feel like it
should focus on our ability to grow earnings through NII. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. So I guess the message is the $180.7 million in ex-PPP NII, that should be headed higher from here.
And Ram, do you have the details on the remaining PPP fees and just any sense of the breakdown of Round 1
versus 2, how the forgiveness proceeds?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
So we have another $25 million of unrecognized revenues from PPP1 and PPP2 left. Again, the calendar of when
we get to recognize this will depend on the forgiveness process. Obviously, we have about $10 million left on our
PPP1. So that's probably coming through in calendar year 2021. At this point, it's too early to say about this
PPP2. We did originate about $420 million as part of the PPP2 program that you'll see on our balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just moving – Mariner, so obviously, I mean, I think revenue growth – above-average loan growth has
been sort of a differentiating aspect for UMB. Just looking at the loan production levels, I guess in one of your
slides, 24, that declined year-over-year and was weakest in the last five quarters. Anything going on there? Does
that speak to just borrowers being in a wait-and-watch mode? And knowing what you know now, do you expect
core loan growth be in that high-single digits, low-double digits range for the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'm not trying to – so 25...

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think that's just timing. That's mostly timing. We continue to see growth across the board that – there's nothing to
that story really. The one headwind we have on our C&I business is just lower utilization. And that's a significant
opportunity as we roll forward as the economy opens up and things normalize, we should – we've got about 4
percentage points off our regular utilization rate.
And I know everybody is talking about that, but that's [ph] late in earnings power there in growth (00:22:46). But
we're making up for that really across the board, I would say, both geographically and vertically. And that slide is
just more of a timing thing on a year-over-year basis.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just one last one, if I may. In terms of capital deployment, talk to us – I mean, you talked about
some fintech partnerships. You've previously talked about bank M&A. Give us a sense of where your mind is at in
terms of ability to deploy capital inorganically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're – I don't really have anything new to say than what I've been saying for some time there where we
have an active M&A process. We are actually having conversations with other banks and we're just looking for the
right deal and we're not going to do – we're not going to go do something just to do it. So, we're looking for the
right deal and it's an active process.
And on the non-bank side, as we've said before, we're always in the market looking for bolt-on opportunities for
our corporate trust business, our public finance business, our fund services business, which, by the way, year-
over-year, we were up $100 billion in assets under administration in our fund services business. So across the
board, our institutional businesses are very, very strong. And we are always looking for those bolt-on
opportunities to continue to consolidate.

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, this is Jim Rine. On the fintech side, those will continue to be partnerships where we'll offer our banking
as a service products and open up our balance sheet and services for those companies where we'll do the bank
in a box type model, offer FDIC Sweep, or account services in debit cards, et cetera. So that will provide the
additional fee income and partnerships with those folks versus looking to acquire unless the opportunity is right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe first on expenses, great quarter for
expense run rate. And if I recall correctly, I think there's a little bit over $9 million kind of seasonal payroll expense
in the quarter. As we look ahead, does all of that fall through to the bottom line in the second quarter as some of
that rolls off? Or are there going to be investments made that is going to offset some of that reduction?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Ram, why don't you take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Like we said last quarter, Timur, right, our expense run rate is about $200 million, $202 million. Any
particular quarter it goes up and down. But you are right. There are some seasonal increases that are typical to
the first quarter like FICA. So that can decrease by $3 million to $4 million as you go into the second quarter. And
then a large part of our expense base, as I've said before, is also variable rate in nature like bonus and
commission. So when bond trading or other business activity is really strong, that can also skew our expense
from one quarter to another quarter.
One thing that I would say in terms of looking ahead, right, we announced the sale of Prairie Capital Management
and annually that's about $15 million of expenses. So you'll see that recede starting the second quarter. So as
you think about expenses going forward, I would model it that way as well.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. And then maybe if I could just follow-up on Ebrahim's question on loan growth, it's been
a couple of quarters now where the conversation has been about growing balances in underrepresented markets.
I'm just wondering, A, how much more runway is there? And then, B, in the backend of the year, if some of the
more traditional pipelines come back online, should we expect to see growth accelerate from here? Or is this kind
of a good level to see loan growth going forward for a longer period of time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So what I'd say about that is that it's much longer than a couple quarters. We've got kind of a decade of
close to double-digit loan growth behind us. And we don't really expect anything different in the future than what
we've seen in the past. So the commentary about that penetration is there's a pretty big long-term runway across
our footprint as you think about penetration. So almost every market we're in outside of Kansas City is larger by
population and business activity than Kansas City. And we have very low market share in almost all of them. So
through just pure execution and having the right teams on the ground, we've got a really long runway really across
the board, both geographically and vertically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
And this is Jim Rine. And what that means is it's not dependent on the economy. Generally, we're taking market
share, which is someone else's client. So when we are obtaining market share, we're taking business that's
already there, that is not necessarily dependent upon the current economic activity. So as we grow our market
share in those particular markets, it doesn't have anything to do with the economy. It has to do with our sales
efforts.

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Ram, maybe I'll start with you. The $15 million, just for modeling purposes, the $15 million of expenses from
Prairie, what's the – can you provide the revenue run rate that we need to remove as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. If you look at the last couple of years, it's averaged about $16 million to $18 million, mostly in fees. All of it
is fees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
$16 million to 18 million, okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
The net contribution is anywhere from $2 million to $3 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Got it. Okay. And then just kind of putting the pieces together with the constructive outlook on revenue and
the good expense quarter, I mean, you had positive operating leverage last year. Is that kind of base case for this
year given where we are economically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think so. I mean, generally, it's hard to tell. There are a lot of moving parts. But we – I guess what I'd say is, we
do feel strongly that we've got our expenses under control and we do feel pretty strong about our revenue profile.
So, absent any headwinds or challenges to come our way that – we do feel like sort of some level of operating
leverage is reasonable to expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would agree with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then on credit, we've seen a lot of banks just move their reserve down because of the improvement in
the economy. I think you've alluded to that further releases could be on the horizon. How do I think about, Ram,
the trough, I guess, where you get to and when relative to day one of last year with CECL?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So – this is Mariner. We're very careful about this and cautious about it because we think that the reserves are
there for a reason. And our business, we're in the risk business. So we're monitoring it closely. And obviously in
the methodology you've got qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative stuff is going to be what it is, driven by
the performance of our loan portfolio and the growth of our loan portfolio, and the Moody's indications around
economic activity and unemployment.
So that piece will be what it'll be. And then we will overlay some qualitative things based on other uncertainties
and such to make sure that the reserves are there to protect us and protect our shareholders. So, we – on the
track – on the trajectory that we're on right now, it is very reasonable to expect that we would do another release
in the second quarter. What that looks like, how big it is, we're not prepared to give you any real guidance on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. And then lastly, if I could just. I just want to make sure I saw the announcement on the buyback,
which I know you kind of authorize every year, but I'm putting the pieces together. And what you said last quarter,
Mariner, I mean that's still kind of bottom of the rung in terms of priorities with capital today, buybacks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Absolutely. Our number one focus is to grow shareholder value and through investing in growth. That's the
number one priority.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
The growth on the institutional fee income side has been pretty impressive over the last few quarters. Just trying
to get a sense of kind of that growth rate on the asset servicing and corporate trust side of things is sustainable
kind of near the rates that we've seen recently or if you guys are expecting somewhat of an acceleration just
based on some of the pieces that have been put in place recently.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll take that, start with it and then Jim can jump in. But what I would say about [ph] fixed (00:33:32) fund services
with all the liquidity that's in the system right now and what has happened with interest rates, the pursuit of return
has been pretty accelerated. It has driven a lot of activity in the alternatives and privates over the last [ph] few
(00:33:52) years. I don't see that slowing down and our fund servicing business is set up. We are one of the
largest and most successful players in the private and alternative space.
And so what you've seen is us benefit from that activity of liquidity and the move from public investing to private
investing. We don't see that slowing down. We expect to continue to be a major recipient of that shift in the way
money is being invested. Along with that, you have the democratization of private investing, which has gone much
further downstream into the spectrum of who can invest in private.
So all that bodes really well in the fund space for the privates and alternatives. So that's what I say, is the
backdrop for our fund services business pipeline is very strong, technology platform is great. We're efficient.
We've got a top flight team. We've been able to pick up people from all our competitors. And because of all the
consolidation in that business, it sort of put a lot of our competitors on the sidelines. So we're very excited about
what's happening with fund services.
Corporate trust business, we continue to consolidate there and that business is poised really well for win. Win and
if – I'm going to say win because I believe that's likely to happen. The infrastructure build comes through. We'll be
poised on a national basis, both through corporate trusts and our public finance business to, well, underwrite,
settle and do all the [indiscernible] (00:35:26) trust fee services really across the country.
We have offices in New York now. We're doing business in Florida, New York, New Jersey, LA, large, large
projects, hundreds and hundreds of millions dollar type projects, which is a big shift from the kind of size deals we
were doing prior to opening offices on the coast. So, we're kind of clipping on the heels of number one and
number two as the third largest trustee and paying agent in the country. We're looking for consolidation
opportunities there.
Our specialty business in the aviation space, we're very excited about, particularly as the economy is starting to
open up again. That means – and the Boeing issue is resolving themselves. I mean, planes are going to be
getting bought and sold across the globe. Our Irish office in Dublin allows us to do business now in 70 more
countries than we were able to before. Ireland is sort of the structured finance capital world. And so, that allows us
to really open the doors for that business globally. So that's the corporate trust and our bankruptcy trustee
business is doing very, very well there too.
I think we just had our first $2 million quarter in that business in the first quarter. So, very, very excited about that.
And then our – Jim touched on our Investor Solutions business, which was a relatively mature business relying on
the wirehouses and brokerage firms. And now we're seeing it grow again by providing the same services to the
fintech. And you can see in our deck there, the four latest fintech companies that have signed up to do business
with us. And then our wealth business. Well, so you asked about institutional, so I'll pause there. We talked about
that.

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
I would say the only thing to add on the institutional business is that as the rates have gone down, we've seen the
12b-1 fees erode and then as rates go back up, that business will continue to be additive as those come back. So
we've been growing the traditional fee side. And then as rates go back up, we'll see 12b-1 fees. So Mariner, hit all
the highlights on that. I don't have anything else to add other than you can see additional – you'll look to see
additional growth as rates improve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A

I always steal Jim's thunder.

Nathan J. Race Q

Got it. That's great color. Appreciate it and all the other details in the updated slide deck as well. Perhaps just
changing gears and just going back to the M&A discussion. Just curious with the stocks still near all-time highs
and obviously having a strong currency to affect transactions going forward, if you're feeling more or less
optimistic on the acquisition front on a whole bank perspective looking forward over the course of 2021 here?

Well, certainly, I would say if you're talking about just the industry backdrop, deals are getting done. So pricing
seems to be getting some consistency and there seems to be some foundation being built for deals to get done.
So we'd like to think so, we hope so. But again, we don't do [ph] ticker tape (00:39:08) deals. We're not going to
dig deep into something that has some hair on it just to get something done. We're going to our guidelines, keep
within the rails of doing good quality, high quality deals. And we just have to build relationships, see what
happens.

Operator: As we have no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to
turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add, this is Mariner, we didn't really get to talk about wealth management, but we're
very excited about what's going on with the wealth management business. We had a very nice quarter. We talked
mostly about institutional on the fee side, but our wealth business had a very strong first quarter with new
business.
And I did mention in our prepared comments that we've launched our family office business. We think we have a
very unique offering. We've hired an excellent CIO for that business, comes to us from the private side, private
investing side for Northern Trust, ran the institutional segment for Northern. And so, we're very excited about our
wealth offering.
We have the right, as an institution has been around a really, really long time, trusted partner with institutional
capital and institutional backing. We're very excited about how that couples with our commercial business and the
prospects for that going forward. So, that's the only thing I would add. And other than that, we appreciate
everybody's time.
