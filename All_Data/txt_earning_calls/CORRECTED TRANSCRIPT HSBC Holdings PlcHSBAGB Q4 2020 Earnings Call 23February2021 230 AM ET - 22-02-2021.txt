MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning to everybody in London and good afternoon to everybody in Hong Kong. We have two objectives
today. The first is to take you through our Q4 and Full Year Results for 2020, and the second is to update you on
progress against the change agenda we shared with you last February and the additional actions we are taking to
deliver returns above the cost of capital.
I'll start with a few reflections on the year just gone. Ewen will then take you through our full year and fourth
quarter results. Then myself, Peter Wong, Nuno Matos, and John Hinshaw will share key details of our future
plan. Ewen will then return to cover the financial implications of that plan.
Let me start with 2020. First and most importantly, our people provided amazing support to our customers and the
communities we serve throughout the world. We provided more than $52 billion of wholesale lending support
through government schemes and moratoria, more than $26 billion of additional relief for personal customers, and
more than $1.9 trillion of loan, debt, and equity support for our wholesale customers. However, the numbers don't
do justice to the efforts and energies that went into delivering them.
My colleagues acted with great purpose on a global scale. They broke down silos, they innovated and they
delivered repeatedly in the toughest of circumstances. They were customer-centric in the truest sense of the term.
And our customer scores in the UK, Hong Kong, the US, the Middle East, and Mexico, [ph] they decide
(00:02:02).
Second, the economic impact of COVID-19 hit our profitability, but we still delivered $12.1 billion of adjusted pre-
tax profits and $8.8 billion of reported profit before tax. We also finished the year with a strong capital base of
15.9% and increased our liquidity by around $170 billion. This proves two things. This is an incredibly strong and
resilient business particularly in Asia which delivered $13 billion of adjusted profit before tax, but also opportunity
exists even in a difficult year. We increased mortgage lending in the UK and Hong Kong. We grew our share of
trade in Asia despite the fall in volumes. We grew our wealth balances in our target markets and we made $1
billion of PBT in our India business, which will be hugely important in the years to come.
Third, it was an incredibly important to us to resume dividend payments and we have declared a dividend of $0.15
per share. We are also resetting our dividend policy in the future to strike a balance between providing good
income and supporting future growth. In future, we're aiming to deliver sustainable cash dividends while
transitioning towards a payout ratio of 40% to 55% from 2022. We're no longer going to offer a scrip dividend, and
we'll consider share buybacks beyond the near term when no immediate opportunity for capital redeployment
exists. This is a measured policy that gives us the flexibility to invest and grow the business in future.
Clearly, 2020 fundamentally challenged many businesses. So we also embarked on a major exercise to refresh
our core purpose as an organization. We consulted widely on this over a number of months, speaking to
thousands of colleagues and customers, looking deeply into our history, but also assessing the world of the
future. And we kept coming back to the same things. HSBC has always focused on helping customers pursue the
opportunities around them whether it's individuals, families, or businesses. Our renewed purpose, opening up a
world of opportunity, both captures this saying and sets a challenge. Opportunity never stands still. It changes and
3

evolves with the world around us. It is our job to keep adapting with it and to find and capture opportunities with
the same spirit of entrepreneurialism and innovation that I feel represents HSBC at its very best.
We also saw in 2020 the power of an organization that can respond positively and at pace to radical change on a
global scale. Hence, you will see a new behavior within our value statements. We get it done. It's deliberately
expressed in uncomplicated language. We can talk about what we want to achieve forever, but execution is
everything. Last February, I promised we deliver our plans with pace and conviction, which is exactly what we've
done. We've taken more than $1 billion of costs out of the business and expect to exceed our $4.5 billion cost
saving target ahead of schedule. And despite the pause in our redundancy program following the COVID-19
outbreak, we've reduced our FTE and contractor head count by around 11,000. In achieving those head counts
and cost savings, we created a combined wholesale banking back office function serving both Commercial
Banking and Global Banking.
We merged Wealth and Personal Banking. We reduced our senior management population by 17%. We
appointed new people to just under 50% of the top 200 senior positions. We reduced our US branch footprint by
more than 30% and cut our US adjusted cost base by 8%. We reduced FTEs in our European non-ring-fenced
bank by 6%. And we achieved $52 billion of gross RWA savings in 2020, taking us more than halfway towards our
three-year gross risk-weighted asset reduction target in just a single year.
However, given the impact of low interest rates and COVID, we no longer expect to reach our targeted level of
returns by 2022. That said, we recognized the fundamental shifts in our environment in 2020 and reacted to them
quickly. The plans we are announcing today will build on this work and enable us to target a return on tangible
equity at or above 10% over the medium term. And that's with the assumption that base interest rates remain at
today's ultra-low levels. Ewen will now take you through our results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon all. A few quick words on the full year 2020 results. The combined
impact of COVID-19 and ultra-low interest rates significantly impacted our reported profit before tax, down 34%
from the prior year to $8.8 billion. On the positive side, our Asian business held up well with $13 billion of adjusted
pre-tax profits. This included the second year running of $1 billion of pre-tax profits from our Indian franchise and
further market share gains in our trade franchise in the region.
We did a good job of controlling operating costs, down $1.1 billion or 3%, well ahead of what we promised we'd
achieve a year ago. We achieved exceptional growth in our deposit franchise, up $173 billion in the year or some
12%. And we strengthened our core capital base with our Core Tier 1 ratio up 120 basis points to 15.9%.
As we move into 2021, it's the interest rate environment that's most negatively impacting our returns outlook. And
it's why we're shifting our revenue mix towards non-interest income, accelerating our capital allocation, people,
and investment towards Asia; and investing in a multi-year technology plan to significantly improve productivity.
Turning to slide 8. On the fourth quarter, it was a solid set of results with reported pre-tax profits of $1.4 billion.
Adjusted revenues were down 14% on last year's fourth quarter mainly driven by the progressive impact of ultra-
low interest rates. Expected credit losses were 44 basis points or $1.2 billion in the quarter. This compares to 26
basis points or just under $700 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Total ECLs for the full year were $8.8 billion, at the lower end of our targeted $8 billion to $13 billion full-year
range. While operating costs were up Q4-on-Q4 by 1% ex the bank levy. This was mainly driven by a decision to
4

(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
increase the variable pay pool accrual in the quarter which was down 17% year-on-year. And tangible net asset
value per share increased by $0.20 in the quarter to $7.75.
As you model 2021, please note that the weakening of the US dollar towards the end of 2020 will materially
impact both costs and revenues. If you adjusted our 2020 results to average January exchange rates, it would
have added $1.6 billion to our revenues and $1.1 billion to our operating costs.
Turning to slide 9 and looking at fourth quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses. In Wealth
and Personal Banking, revenues were down 18% on a year ago with retail banking revenues falling by just under
$1 billion. This was due largely to the impact of falling interest rates on deposit margins. Wealth management
revenues were down $91 million due to a combination of lower insurance sales and the impact of lower interest
rates on private banking deposits.
Commercial Banking revenues were 15% lower due mainly to the impact of lower margins on global liquidity and
cash management. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 7% and that's despite another good
quarter of global markets which saw revenues up 13%, even as we kept value at risk broadly stable.
On slide 10, net interest income was $6.6 billion. That's up 3% against the third quarter. The net interest margin
was 122 basis points, up 2 basis points on the third quarter, reflecting improved liability margins particularly in the
US and Europe. As we look forward, while we expect a soft start for non-interest income â€“ for net interest income
due to the lower short-term HIBOR rates and fewer days this quarter, we expect NIM stabilization and lending
volume growth to progressively support net interest income over the remainder of the year.
On the next slide, two core trends to discuss. Firstly on fee income, we saw greater stability in the fourth quarter,
notably in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets, with a small reduction in fees in Wealth and
Personal Banking, reflecting lower insurance sales and unsecured lending volumes. And secondly, on other non-
interest income, it was down $800 million. This reflected a combination of lower interest earned on securities held
in the trading book, a reduction in the value of new business written in insurance, and lower credit and funding
valuation adjustments in Global Banking and Markets. For 2021, we expect customer activity and fee income to
recover as economic activity recovers and we've seen a good start to the year in Hong Kong. But with the impact
of new COVID-19 variants, this recovery may be slower than we foresaw a few months ago in areas such as
consumer credit. We also expect global markets to have trading activity lower than we experienced last year.
On the next slide, ECLs were $1.2 billion or 44 basis points of gross loans in the quarter. Relative to the third
quarter, this mainly reflects higher Stage 3 charges and the fact that the third quarter benefited from additional
releases. The Stage 1 and 2 P&L charge for 2020 was around $4.5 billion including around $300 million incurred
in the fourth quarter. We now have Stage 1 and Stage 2 provision balances of $7.9 billion. That's up $3.9 billion in
2020.
While we remain cautious on the outlook for credit in 2021, we expect the 2021 ECL charge to be lower than
2020. And we've now updated, at this point, to the guidance we gave you at third quarter effectively a range of
approximately 40 basis points to 60 basis points this year. By 2022, we expect ECLs to have materially reduced
from the 81 basis point charge in 2020 towards or even below the lower end of our 30 basis point to 40 basis
point normalized range.
Turning to slide 13, fourth quarter adjusted operating costs ex the bank levy were $780 million higher than the
third quarter. This was driven by targeted technology investment and marketing spend together with a decision to
increase the variable pay pool. For the year as a whole, operating costs were down $1.1 billion or 3%. This
5

included a number of offsetting items. The variable pay pool was down by more than $500 million. COVID-19-
impacted cost items like travel and entertainment and marketing were down by around $600 million. And our
combined cost programs over 2019 and 2020 delivered in-year savings of $1.4 billion.
Offsetting this were various items including increased technology investment, up $377 million or 7% on 2019. For
2021, we expect the bank levy to fall to around $300 million. That's some $500 million lower than 2020. For
operating costs ex the bank levy, we're seeking to keep them broadly flat after adjusting for the impact of dollar
weakness with significant cost savings from our ongoing restructuring program, offset by a combination of certain
costs increasing from COVID-19 lows together with planned higher investment and growth spend.
On slide 14, in the first year of our three-year program, we achieved $52 billion of gross risk-weighted asset saves
with more than halfway towards our $100 billion gross reduction target of low returning risk-weighted assets. This
included a $10 billion reduction in the fourth quarter. We expect to make around a further $30 billion of gross
RWA sales in 2021.
On slide 15, our Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 15.9%. That's up 30 basis points in the
quarter. This was driven by a combination of RWA reductions on a constant currency basis, profit generation, FX
translation differences and 21 basis points of software intangible benefit. On the latter, we expect software
intangibles to be reversed out of our Core Tier 1 over the next 12 to 18 months.
Excluding FX movements, risk-weighted assets fell by $20 billion in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of
reducing lending balances. The planned 2020 interim dividend of $0.15 resulted on a reduction of 40 basis points
to our Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2020.
And with that back to Noel.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Ewen. So, last February, we announced series of actions to make HSBC fit for the future and we remain
committed to delivering them. But there were three fundamental shifts in 2020 that we must reflect in our plans for
the future. First, the interest rate environment changed dramatically. We lost around $5.3 billion of net interest
income or more than 2 percentage points of RoTE and we don't expect rates to rebound anytime soon. We
reacted to this in two ways. â€“ by accelerating our shift towards non-interest income including earned fee income,
and cutting our costs further and faster to compensate for lost revenue.
Second, the shift to digital was accelerated by the impact of lockdown. As the pandemic took hold, our customers'
digital engagement increased dramatically. We were already investing heavily in digital and technology. So we
responded by rapidly accelerating the digitization of our business.
Third, COVID-19 has made everyone aware of how fragile the global economy is to an external event. And as a
consequence, environmental issues have taken on a renewed importance. Thankfully, we were already working
on the next phase of our successful journey with respect to sustainability and we announced an ambitious new
climate plan in October of last year. The low carbon transition is the most transformative trend of our time, and it
presents an unmissable commercial opportunity for a bank of our size, geography, and profile.
So these three trends and the decisive action we took to meet them form the basis for much of what you're going
to hear over the next 30 minutes. We have a plan that we think can deliver at least 10% return on tangible equity
over the medium term. It will transfer material amounts of capital from low return markets to higher return markets.

That capital will be deployed into businesses in Asia where we already have a strong track record of growth and
profitability, and we will also invest in technology to transform our costs. It's a plan capable of delivering returns
above the cost of capital and supporting both sustainable dividends and future growth. It is built on the four pillars
you see here on slide 19, and I'll take you through each one in turn.
Slide 20 looks at the first pillar of our plan, driving growth by focusing on our strengths. We're going to stop trying
to be everything to everyone. We want to do the things that capitalize on the advantages we have and to do them
brilliantly. In Wealth and Personal Banking, we will continue to invest in our scale markets in the UK and Hong
Kong, but the new story here is Asia wealth. Nuno will talk about this in more detail. But, we're going to invest
more than $3.5 billion in wealth in Asia in the next five years to achieve three things. We want to serve high net
worth and ultra-high net worth clients in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Singapore, and Southeast Asia globally. We
want to build out our insurance and asset management capabilities across Asia with organic and inorganic
options firmly on the table. And we want to do more with clients who already bank with us, bringing wealth
opportunities to our customers in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets.
In Commercial Banking, we will continue to be unashamedly and uniquely global. We want to lead the world in
cross-border trade and in serving mid-market corporates globally. There are many things that are changing with
respect to our strategy and our execution, but this one will remain unchanged. We'll invest around $2 billion to
drive customer acquisition to become a digital leader in upscale markets and to support the three critical product
platforms â€“ global liquidity and cash management, global trade and receivables finance, and foreign exchange.
Global Banking and Markets will retain the capacity to serve clients globally, but we'll invest in the markets that set
us apart, whilst also moving the heart of the business to Asia, including leadership. We will use our global network
to connect our Global Banking and Markets clients to opportunities in Asia, the UK and the Middle East where we
can add the greatest value. We'll spend around $800 million in GB&M in Asia to build better digital market
platforms to support our wealth strategy, to build better market access and execution capabilities for our
wholesale clients, and to expand our investment banking coverage across Asia. Peter will talk about this in a few
minutes.
Slide 21 shows where our US and European business is fitting. Michael Roberts and the US team did a great job
in 2020 repositioning the business â€“ closing branches, driving down costs, and reducing capital. For the next
stage, we will focus the vast majority of our resources into our international corporate and institutional franchise in
the US. We'll continue to connect our US wholesale clients into our international network, driving revenue growth
in other regions.
We'll also defend our strength in US dollar clearing, trade, and foreign exchange and continue to reposition US
markets and security services to provide access in a way that uses less capital. In US retail, our focus will be on
building an international wealth platform that connects WPB clients across our global network to US wealth
opportunities, and we continue to explore organic and inorganic options for our US retail banking franchise.
For Europe, the story is similar. Nuno and the team laid solid foundations in 2020, removing RWAs and reducing
FTEs by 6%. Our strategy remains focused on connecting inbound and outbound international wholesale
customers into our network. And our wealth business is focused on our global booking centers in Mainland
Europe. We'll keep investing in our transaction banking franchises to better connect issuers and investors into
Europe â€“ in Europe to Asia and continue to reduce or access subscale retail banking and SME portfolios. We are
continuing with the strategic review of our retail banking operations in France and are in negotiations in relation to
a potential sale, although no decision has yet been taken. If any sale is implemented given the underlying
performance of the French retail business, a loss on sale is expected.

Slide 22 looks at the second pillar of our plan and this is incredibly important. We see our digital agenda as
presenting opportunities for both revenue growth and cost efficiency. In the last year, we spent around $5.5 billion
on digital and technology. The impact of this is coming through our digital engagement and ratings in our revenue,
in our cost base and in our ability to operate a global business in the middle of COVID.
We wouldn't have achieved what we have already done without that historical investment. John will go into more
detail about the future investment program, but I want to take a minute or two to talk about how we'll pay for it. We
think we need to grow investment by between 7% and 10% on a compound annual basis between 2019 and
2022. To pay for that, we need to reduce the cost of running HSBC by 4% to 5% over the same period.
We intend to save $1 billion more on costs than we said last February on a constant currency basis. We'll make
our cost programs work harder to deliver between $5 billion and $5.5 billion of savings, and we'll spend around $7
billion to achieve those savings with at least half of that falling in 2021. We also intend to keep our headline costs
broadly stable from 2022 onwards enabling us to reinvest further savings into the business.
Slide 23 is about energizing HSBC for growth, so the culture, the composition, and the future skills we need. This
is about creating a dynamic, inclusive, and entrepreneurial organization. We've already infused the top of the firm
with new people and new skills. More than three-quarters of my senior leadership team have been in post for
around a year or less; and of the layer below, just under half of the top 200 took off their current roles in 2020.
We've also reduced senior management numbers by 17% removing layers and increasing accountability. I'm
passionate about creating an inclusive organization that unlocks opportunity for all and fosters the diversity of
thought and experience that every business needs. The diversity of our top team is improving, but we want to go
further both in terms of gender and ethnicity.
We also made good progress improving employee advocacy, but there are gaps amongst some employee groups
that we must bridge. We also need to build skills and capabilities in areas that are different to what we've needed
historically particularly in digital, analytics, and sustainability. We can bring some of those in from our side as we
have done over the last 12 months. But we also need to train from within which we're doing through the newly
expanded HSBC University, for which I was the executive sponsor before I became Group CEO.
Slide 24 looks at one of our biggest opportunities and one of our biggest drivers of change, the transition to net
zero. We're already a global leader in sustainability and we want to stay there as the market expands
exponentially. In 2020, we were the biggest underwriter of green, social, sustainability and sustainability linked
bonds for the second year running, doubling the volume we underwrote in 2019. We've already set out some
uniquely ambitious plans for a bank of our scale and footprint to reduce emissions in our operations and supply
chain to net zero by 2030 and to align our portfolio of financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner.
In May, we intend to file a resolution to our AGM requesting investor approval for a clear, science-based route to
a net zero aligned portfolio. It will commit the ban to ending financing of coal-fired power. It will align our financed
emissions to net zero and it will commit us to evidence in it through very specific milestones and reporting.
Let me be clear that we intend and plan to work with all our clients in every sector to map and finance their low
carbon transition. We are aligning every part of our business behind that aim both to achieve our net zero
ambition and to capture the commercial opportunity.
So, taking all of this in aggregate, what does tomorrow's HSBC look like? We're effectively undertaking three
pivots â€“ to Asia, to wealth, and fee income. We'll also continue to grow our global capability in wholesale banking
8

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
and further leverage our unique capability to service mid-market corporates globally. These are our highest return,
highest growth opportunities. We expect to move around 8 percentage points of group tangible equity to Asia over
the medium to long term, and we're linking this to compensation for the first time. It will explicitly be part of mine
and Ewen's scorecards.
We also expect to move around 10 percentage points of tangible equity to Wealth and Personal Banking over the
same period with a broadly equivalent reduction in Global Banking and Markets. The focused investment in
wealth combined with our investment in technology aims to deliver compound annual revenue growth in the mid-
single digits from 2022. That should accelerate the growth of fee income and insurance income from 29% to
around 35% of group revenue over the medium to long term. This is an ambitious plan, but a deliverable plan.
And we're going to move with pace and determination and belief in our ability to get it done.
I'll now hand over to Peter to talk about our Asia opportunity; Nuno to talk about our pivot to wealth; and John to
talk about the technology that underpins everything we want to achieve.

Peter Wong Tung Shun
Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive-The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. I want to start by saying I'm very excited about Asia's growth and HSBC is uniquely positioned
to capitalize on the opportunities. Economically, Asia is outperforming the rest of the world. It contributed 71% of
global growth in 2019 and is expected to account for almost half of global GDP by 2025. The key story in Asia is
rapid wealth creation. By 2030, two-thirds of the world's middle class will be in Asia, up from just over 50% today,
driving strong growth in consumer spending. And this would promote trade. PwC forecasts that trade flows in Asia
will grow 25% faster than the rest of the world over the next five years.
For HSBC, the opportunities lie not just in helping sustainable growth, supporting trade and managing the wealth
within the region, but also in using our unique global footprint that connect the rest of the world to Asia and vice
versa. We are already a leader in Asia. We operate in 19 markets across the region covering 98% of Asia's GDP.
For the majority of our markets, our history goes back 140 to 150 years. Therefore, we know the customers, the
cultures; we know the regulators; and we know the business flows. And when it comes to global connectivity, our
international competitors lack our footprint and deep connection to Asia, and our Asian competitors lack our
international network.
Within Asia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Southeast Asia, and India will drive our growth. These markets will
benefit from an expected doubling of assets under management in Asia with $30 trillion over the next five years.
To expand our businesses, we will continue to strengthen our position in Hong Kong, our market-leading digital
product in particular, and leverage our strength to capitalize on the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a region
with a population of 73 million and GDP of $1.7 trillion.
We will hire more than 3,000 wealth managers in China where we expect the middle class population to double
from the current 300 million to 600 million by 2028. In Singapore, in our Wealth and Personal Banking business,
we will increase resources to build on the momentum created by last year double-digit AUM growth across
Premier and Jade and establish regional wealth management hub for ASEAN and South Asia.
Our Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking businesses will capitalize on the more than 4,200
multinational corporations that have regional headquarters in Singapore. We already bank some 750 of these and
we will build on this progress by scaling up our coverage teams and product capabilities including cash, liquidity,
risk management to increase our market share in the space.

In India, we will build on our long-standing national and international relationships. We accelerate the growth
momentum we have already established. Also banking revenue grew by over 20% per annum in the last two
years. And we also aim to leverage our unrivaled network to win a larger share of the [ph] 18 million (00:39:21)
non-resident Indian wealth management business across the world.
So how are we going to do this? We will invest an additional $6 billion in the region over the next five years, with
half of it in South and Southeast Asia. The investment is mainly in new talent for our wealth management and
wholesale banking businesses and improving our technology. Externally, we will enhance our digital capabilities
across all markets to deliver a tailored end-to-end customer experience enabling our 14 million clients who use
our network to move or invest their capital globally and seamlessly.
Internally, we will invest in areas, including data and analytics powered by artificial intelligence and machine
learning, to anticipate the needs of our customers more effectively and capture a greater share of wallet across
retail, commercial and global banking. And we will continue to maximize the revenue-generating potential of our
global footprint and product range. Already, 55% of our global revenue is driven by cross-border businesses.
In the last 12 months, we have won awards for Best Global Trade Finance Bank, Best Digital Bank and Best
Regional Private Bank among many others. We will continue to invest to capitalize on the huge and growing
opportunities in Asia's wealth market and work towards becoming Asia's leading international wholesale bank.
Overall, these actions will increase market share and boost our revenue streams, which will generate double-digit
PBT growth in Asia over the medium to long term allowing the region to continue to deliver significant
contributions to HSBC Group dividend. This is really an exciting time to be in Asia and really an exciting time to be
in HSBC.
And with that, I'll hand over to Nuno. Thank you.

Nuno A. Matos
Chief Executive, Wealth and Personal Banking, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Peter. Last year, we created Wealth and Personal Banking and we brought together our mass-affluent
asset management, insurance and private banking businesses into one integrated business allowing for a
significant acceleration of our wealth strategy. Last year, this business generated close to $8 billion in high
liquidity wealth revenues with more than 50% being fee revenue. Our wealth expansion is well underway. We've
made the necessary structural changes. The plans are well defined. We have bold but achievable ambitions and
we are in full execution mode particularly in Asia, but also in our global wealth hubs. And that's what I would like
to talk about today.
We believe that wealth management is one of the most compelling opportunities for growth in financial services
today. The affluent and high net worth population expansion, lower rates for longer and the capital-light profile of
this business makes it very attractive. And while the opportunities are global, Asia is no doubt the fastest-growing
region for wealth assets.
In this context, HSBC is perfectly placed to capture this opportunity. We have a compelling starting point with 4
million customers and $1.6 trillion of wealth balances, making us a leading international wealth manager. The
lion's share is in Asia accounting for more than 65% of our wealth revenues. We are the second largest wealth
manager in Asia leveraging the strength of our brand, which is built on a 155-year heritage of serving customers
and the full capabilities of a universal bank. Last year, we grew our global wealth balances by more than $160
billion, a double-digit growth.

Second, as the wealth opportunity becomes truly global, our international network gives us the ability to deliver
transactional banking and wealth management services in the most relevant markets to our international-oriented
affluent and high net worth customers. We have a strong presence in the world's top eight cross-border wealth
hubs. And third, we have unique access to our prospect customers through our leading CMB and GBM
businesses and their extensive client base. In 2020, more than 60% of net new money from asset management
and private banking came from our wholesale relationships. So, over the next three to five years, we will invest
more than $3.5 billion to leverage these advantages and accelerate development of our wealth business
particularly in Asia.
Our investments will be focused on two areas. Firstly, developing new products, technology, and platforms to
deliver a leading client experience. We will build digitally-enabled financial planning platforms across the client
continuum and scale up our insurance, health, and wellness platforms. We will integrate our wealth management
capabilities with a mobile-first approach and create a single core banking platform for private banking across Asia
and EMEA.
We will differentiate our asset management business with a focus on high-value, higher margin products and we'll
deliver high conviction products in areas like alternatives, ESG and equities. We'll deliver bespoke wealth
products for our Jade and private banking customers in partnership with Global Banking and Markets. And we'll
grow and deepen ultra-high net worth clients through a dedicated client coverage model, focusing on Asia and the
Middle East and on products which make best use of group's capabilities.
In parallel, two-thirds of our investments will aim to significantly expand our distribution capabilities. These efforts
will focus on hiring more than 5,000 customer-facing wealth planners equipped with remote digital capabilities,
particularly for our flagship Pinnacle expansion in mainland China and high network coverage in Singapore; on
significantly growing our private banking reach on Mainland China to 10 cities and more than doubling our Jade
customer base in Mainland China and Singapore; and finally, in expanding our asset management footprint in
emerging Asia, particularly India and Malaysia.
These investments will enable us to grow our AUMs in Asia faster than the markets and grow revenues by more
than 10% CAGR, significantly increasing the contribution of wealth to our total WPB revenues.We have strong
credentials to deliver on this ambition. Our leadership position in Hong Kong is well known, having delivered
strong growth over the last five years and consolidating our number one wealth market share.
Our UK integrated digital wealth capabilities are now very credible with recent rollouts of FlexInvest, Well+, and
Benefits+. Today, more than 60% of our customers' equity trading in Hong Kong is now done in mobile. We will
be leveraging these capabilities to differentiate our wealth proposition in the rest of Asia.
In Mainland China, we are the largest foreign bank. And despite the challenge of the pandemic, we have
launched Pinnacle in four cities and obtained the first ever foreign fintech license in Mainland China. Our hiring
plans are well underway. In six months, we have approximately 200 wealth planners and we will scale up to 3,000
by 2025. And by the way, we are also exceeding our financial targets. Our roll-out of a leading advice-led private
banking in Mainland China will also benefit from our private banking in Hong Kong which was recently voted
number one for the sixth consecutive year. And in asset management, we will aim to take a majority stake in
Jintrust following changes in regulation and we will execute to become a top 10 international asset management
in Mainland China.

Finally, our global footprint is unique and particularly important in the wealth space as our client needs,
increasingly, are global with material expansion in many wealth corridors. We will invest in our booking centers in
Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, Channel Islands, and the US as key wealth hubs. In India, we will target to be the
number one foreign bank for NRIs. And having already the leading market share among the overseas Chinese
diaspora, as Asians' wealth expands cross border, we are well positioned to grow with it.
I have great confidence in the prospects of our wealth business. The combination of our unique competitive
position, our integrated business structure, and our investment in people and platforms will deliver solid growth.
With our global and Asian position, WPB is well placed and organized to accelerate our wealth growth and deliver
at pace, and I look forward to updating you on our progress.
I will now hand over to John.

Group Chief Operating Officer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Nuno. I want to expand upon what you've heard today and describe how technology will be a
differentiator for the group. Our focus is to shift away from costs across the bank that aren't adding value to
customers and to make investments that drive revenue growth and a better customer experience. But first, let me
explain digital business services. You probably knew it as HOST in the past, which stood for HSBC Operations,
Services and Technology. It's my view that this was a fragmented approach to our task at hand, which is digitizing
our business end-to-end. [ph] Thus, (00:50:42) we are digital, we're focused on improving our business results
and we're a services-based organization, digital business services.
The first slide explains our approach. You probably won't be surprised that we spent more on technology
especially given increased customer demand due to COVID. But more importantly, the amount we're spending is
that we're developing technology in a fundamentally different way. Our approach to building technology platforms
has shifted from building bespoke local solutions to leveraging our scale. We will build once and deploy globally.
We're also laser focused on reducing the bank's cost by digitizing end-to-end processes and eliminating manual
work. To do this, we're dissolving the boundaries between the front, middle and back offices. So work is
processed with the limited or ideally no manual touch points.
In 2020, for example, we processed 7.6 billion payments as a bank and they were worth $563 trillion and we
increased our no touch rate on those transactions to 96%. But we can do even better, our aim is to get above
99% no touch rate in the next several years. And to get those last few percentage points, we're going to need to
digitize the most complex payment processes.
Reducing the number of people involved in manual work means they can be redeployed into revenue-generating
roles and savings can be reinvested back into technology, creating a virtuous circle of digitization that unlocks
customer growth. We're also doubling down on our partnerships with big tech firms like Google and Apple,
Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba as well as many small fintech firms across the globe. For example, we believe
HSBC is one of Google Cloud's largest and most engaged financial services clients, and we're working with them
on intelligence-led financial crime detection which will ultimately help protect our revenues.
The next slide contains three examples of how we're using our scale to improve the customer experience and
drive revenue growth. We've invested over $1 billion in the last few years on our Mobile X platform which is now a
bank in your pocket and it standardizes our core digital platform across all key markets. But one of the most
interesting things about this new platform is the way it's driving personalized interactions. We marketed it
extensively in Hong Kong last year and saw record credit card spending as customers liked the improved
12

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
experience. We've also received App Store ratings in many markets that are 4.7 or higher, which is up
significantly from prior ratings. We now have 3 million Hong Kong digital customers which represent 40% of the
population and over 95% of all retail transactions in Hong Kong are done digitally.
Our Global Money Account platform is a great example of how we're taking something developed in one country,
in this case the US, and deploying it elsewhere. The internationally mobile population requires access to funds in
different countries and currencies. I'm personally a great example of that having just recently moved from the US
to the UK. And our product does just that. It enables instant global transfers with our multi-currency card using
real time FX rates. Built on a common platform, it's now being rolled out worldwide. It went live in the US in
August with planned launches this year in the UK for expats, in the Middle East, and Singapore and shortly the
rest of the world will follow.
And then finally Kinetic, which is a cloud-based mobile app for our corporate customers that we rolled out in the
UK and we're using the insights gained so far to see how we can apply the capabilities in Asia and other parts of
the world.
Finally, let's get into more details on the opportunities to drive operational efficiencies. Clearly COVID has
transformed the way we've all worked over the past year and we now have an opportunity to create a lower
sustained cost base in both corporate real estate and reduced business travel. We've analyzed our worldwide real
estate footprint and anticipate a reduction in the order of 40% over the next several years while also ensuring our
remaining real estate has a lower environmental footprint on the journey to having our operations at net zero by
2030. There're also opportunities to further reduce our workforce, performing non-customer-facing functions.
Overall, our workforce numbers are down 1,100 year-on-year despite the fact that we paused redundancies last
year while we assess the impact of the pandemic on our customers and our people.
But over the next few years through digitizations, we expect the finance function to be reduced by about a third
and we will change the nature of the work the finance teams perform. We'll do this by migrating our analytics and
reporting capability to an agile cloud platform. Our technology head count will be optimized to focus on agile
development and we will reskill our colleagues with the technology skills needed for the future.
There's also an opportunity to materially shrink the number of manual processes which will result in less need for
the vast operations function in our bank today, which currently spans 74,000 resources. Many of these resources
will be reskilled for higher value, customer engaged opportunities including data and analytics skills that are in
high demand. Our commitment throughout HSBC is to attract and retain the best and brightest and most diverse
colleagues for our journey ahead.
Few, if any, other organizations in the world can offer the same breadth of opportunities that HSBC does to apply
cutting edge technology to solve real life problems and improve people's lives. We're doubling down on creating a
diverse and inclusive workforce. I have an entirely new senior management team that has half promoted from
within, half recruited externally and has three-quarter female executives. We will continue to do more to improve
gender balance and diversity across the broader team.
Thanks for listening. Let me hand back over to Ewen now.

Thanks, John. On slide 40, our refresh plan seeks to build returns that at or above the cost of capital and to do so
in an environment where rate broadly stay at today's levels, providing leverage upside of higher rates return in the
13

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
coming years. In order to do this, there's broadly three buckets of return upside. Firstly, things that we just expect
to happen irrespective of management intervention. Into this bucket, I'll put two things â€“ the normalization of ECL
charges that I talked about earlier and the lowering of the bank levy from this year onwards. Together, they should
have around 300 basis points of RoTE over the next few years.
Secondly, the actions we talked about across revenues, costs, and capital. Together, we think these plans can
drive an incremental 400 basis points of return on tangible equity over the coming years. On revenues, a few
things that contribute to this. Firstly, the achievement of a better mix of higher returning lending relationships. This
was a core part of what we announced in February last year, the shifting of capital from certain lower returning
Western clients to the East. We made very good progress on the shift out of the West in 2020 with material
growth risk-weighted asset reductions in our US and non-ring-fenced bank franchises, but COVID-19 did slow the
reallocation of capital to the East relative to what we expected to do last year. However, as Peter has just set out,
we continue to be massive [ph] bulls (00:58:45) on the high growth and return potential across our Asian
franchises. Over the medium term, we have an ambition to have Asia represent around 50% of our tangible
equity. That's up from 42% today with much of the remaining 50% of our capital led to Asia.
And secondly on revenues is our planned growth in non-interest income. You've heard from Peter or Nuno our
raised aspirations in this respect. We see significant growth opportunities in both Asia wealth and Asia wholesale,
and we're committing further material capital, people, technology and investment resources to underpin this.
On operating costs, you've heard today an increased ambition from us. We've raised our 2022 cost reduction
target by a further $1 billion. But more importantly, we've got growing confidence in a multiyear cost opportunity
beyond those and an aspiration to keep costs broadly flat while continuing to achieve healthy revenue growth and
jaws. John just talked about this using technology to transform the whole of our organization, lower front office
distribution costs through increased digital delivery and higher relationship manager productivity, lower
commercial real estate costs as we return to work in a very different way and using technology to transform the
operations and functional support model delivering much better customer and controlled outcomes at a
dramatically lower cost.
And on capital, we've got a whole bunch of initiatives underway stripping back the capital allocation to our US and
non-ring-fenced bank franchises including trapped capital currently sitting in the US, improving the optimization of
capital across various subsidiaries elsewhere and investing in our stress testing capabilities to drive down the
aggregate level of stress across the group. That's why we're now guiding to a 14% to 14.5% Core Tier 1 ratio
rather than the previous 14% to 15%.
And the last building block for our return on tangible equity is an improved rate environment. To be clear, we're
not baking this into our base plans. We want to have a business that can generate cost of equity returns
assuming this rate environment, but I would note that a 100-basis-point parallel shift upwards in rates would
improve our returns by around 300 basis points within two years.
So, on slide 41 and to conclude before handing back to Noel, we're resetting our operating cost target for 2022,
$1 billion lower than previously guided and, post 2022, an ambition to keep costs broadly stable while achieving
material revenue growth. Our gross risk-weighted asset target by the end of 2022 remains unchanged at least
$100 billion, but with over $30 billion achieved in 2020 and a further $30 billion targeted in 2021, we have high
confidence in delivery.
Our Core Tier 1 ratio of 14% or more with confidence in being able to manage to a 14% to 14.5% range over the
medium term, a new dividend policy all cash going forward with no scrip alternative of dividend of $0.15 for 2020
14

and then transitioning in 2021 towards a payout ratio of 40% to 55% from 2022 onwards. This allows for a
powerful combination of both sustainable growth and sustainable dividends. Where we have excess capital in any
given year, we will look to buybacks to augment dividends, but please don't model buybacks into your 2021
numbers.
And a return on tangible equity of at least 10% over the medium term, a return that can be delivered in the current
rate environment with material leverage upside if rates improve, and a return that can be delivered with a set of
actions that sit firmly as self-help measures within this management team's control.
And with that, thanks and over to Noel to conclude.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Ewen. So to wrap up, we will significantly increase the group's capital and resource allocation to faster
growing, higher return markets. We will capitalize on the opportunity offered by our network and our franchise to
drive growth from fee generation products in wealth and platform businesses in wholesale banking. We will
leverage technology to transform our cost position, offering significantly higher operating leverage and freeing up
resources for investment. And we expect all this to deliver returns above the cost of capital while driving revenue
growth principally from Asia.
Through our new dividend policy, we aim to deliver both sustainable dividends and sustainable growth. And as a
final comment, in 2020, we executed against all promises. And in 2021, we will do the same. We will get it done.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Martin Leitgeb
from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. The first question is just on capital. I'm just
trying to understand the moving parts in terms of capital progression from here because on one hand, the very
strong capital trend this quarter, so 15.9%, and the guidance in terms of capital headwind, so Basel III and
software intangibles, so that still implies just around, I mean, if we were just to [ph] parsify (01:06:07) Basel III for
an around $10 billion to $15 billion excess capital spot versus your 14% to 14.5% target range. And just trying to
square it up with your mixed single-digit asset growth ambitions, your investment spend which is over a five-year
period, I understand, and the dividend payout guidance not capturing 2021. Is it right to a significant headroom
here in terms of capital whether that could mean either faster growth, whether that's organically or inorganically or
is there anything I'm missing in terms of the potential headwind.
And the second question, I was just wondering on rate sensitivity. And thank you for the disclosure on slide 69
with a parallel shift in yield curve. Could you help us quantify the impact from purely arising from a steepening of
the yield curve that we have seen obviously over the last couple of weeks â€“ months in US dollar but also in
sterling? Is there fairly a limited impact arising from this steepening of the yield curve given limited [ph] hedges
(01:07:21) in particular in Hong Kong or is there any more meaningful impact coming? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Well, look, I'll start off in the first question, Martin. On â€“ yeah, maybe to deal with it through risk-weighted
assets, I mean if you â€“ we obviously finished the year at just over $850 billion of risk-weighted assets. Yeah, we
are telegraphing an expectation of loan growth in sort of mid-single digits over the next few years. So I think for
this year, it's probably going to be back-end weighted as various economies recover from COVID. We have
around $10 billion of regulatory pressures this year and, yeah, in total about $40 billion to $50 billion if you go
through 2022, 2023 including the impact of Basel.
We've got an RWA rundown program that's still got $50 billion to go that largely offsets that $30 billion this year
and call another $20 billion next year. And then on top of that, which has surprised us, but, yeah, we had
meaningful credit rating migration during 2020. There was about $30 billion of credit migration. We're anticipating
that to be less in 2021. It could be materially less depending on how economies recover. And then a decent
amount of that reverse out in 2022 onwards. So, when you put all that together, we are anticipating risk-weighted
asset growth on distributions. We do expect to be above the 40% to 55% payout ratio in 2021 and then migrating
within that payout ratio thereafter. As I said, no buybacks this year, but it's certainly something that we used in the
past. As you know, we do see them as a legitimate means of capital management. And if we have excess capital
in 2022 and beyond, it's certainly something we'll consider.
And on rate sensitivity, yeah, the steepening of the yield curve in the US dollar provides some support, but not
material support. We're far more sensitive to the near end of the curve.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adrian Cighi from Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Adrian Cighi Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two questions, one follow-up on capital and one on
net interest income. On capital, just to understand, you've very helpfully outlined the risk-weighted asset bridge.
But is there, in your capital target, any sort of part of that surplus capital as it were earmarked for potential
opportunities? And could you maybe outline how much you're thinking and over what period of time?
And then on net interest income, you've had a NIM contribution of 5 basis points from the liabilities side. Can you
give us any insight how much of that is sort of recurring and how much more you could do from either changing
liability mix or repricing going forward?
And then on loan volumes, you've sort of shown a decline on quarter-on-quarter basis from the developments
despite a weaker US dollar, yet you expect a mid-single digit going forward. Sort of where do you expect this to
come from? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. On capital, we're not allocating or precisely allocating any amount to inorganic, but within that dividend policy
of the 40% to 55% payout ratio, we are giving ourselves some flexibility to do bolt-on acquisitions. And I use the
word bolt-on quite carefully, so don't expect us going out and doing material M&A any time soon. But if we see
things that we can bolt on that accelerate our strategy and that some of the areas we talked about today, we'll
certainly consider it.
On net interest income, NIM, generally, I think Q4, there was the repayment of the Ant IPO in Hong Kong which I
think had a material impact on lending volumes together with our traditional cramming down of corporate
borrowings towards year-end. So I wouldn't read too much into Q4 of last year.
On net interest income for this year, we do expect on the positive side some asset growth, as I said, a bias to the
second half. I think the news flow out of the UK yesterday was very positive. Vaccination program has now started
in Hong Kong. You'll have your own forecast for China, but we see significant growth opportunity, I think, in Asia
coming out of the COVID and continue to see a significant opportunity here in the UK mortgages, for example,
where we've been consistently running at about a 10% market share during the year last year.
On both the liabilities side and the assets side, we see some repricing opportunity. Dollar weakness should add
about $800 million or so to non-interest income this year; and offsetting that obviously when you look at our roll-
17

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
forward interest tables, we're going to have some headwinds from the lower interest rates from last year, and we
currently got a very weak HIBOR, so â€“ and you know that we're very, very sensitive to one, three-month HIBOR,
so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Adrian, I'd also add on loan volumes. I think what we saw towards the end of last year particularly in Asia was a
lot of customers â€“ wholesale customers positioning themselves with facilities available to fund future growth, but
not yet drawing down on those facilities. So I think they're ready with their balance sheets to take advantage of an
upturn and they're waiting to see that upturn come as we start to see the world come out of the COVID crisis
hopefully on the back of the vaccination program. But there was certainly a lot of activity towards the end of last
year on getting ready for that upturn.

Another question from the audios, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom Rayner from Numis. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yes, good morning, everybody. A couple, please. First one on the impairment guidance for 2022 either at the
bottom end or below the 30 basis point to 40 basis point range. Can I ask if you're factoring in anything significant
in terms of the releases from the Stage 1 and 2 reserves? So, whether that sort of 2022 number is going to be
representative of sort of through the cycle rate.
And I've got a second question, please. Just on sort of distributions, you mentioned obviously share buybacks are
a possibility. But in the medium term, I noticed that the medium term, you define as three to four years. So, just
wondering whether you're effectively ruling out buybacks for both this year and next year or whether that's reading
too much into the terminology. And I'm assuming that over and above the maximum dividend payout, it will be the
14% to 14.5% target range on equity Tier 1 that sort of calibrates your maximum distribution potential. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Tom, for picking me up on the use of the term medium. So I'll be more careful going forward. No,
we've only ruled out buybacks in 2021, so I wasn't intending to also put a block on us participating in buybacks in
2022.
On impairment guidance, we've talked in the past about a normalized range of 30 basis points to 40 basis points
through the cycle. We were obviously more than double the top end of that in 2020. Included in that was a very
significant buildup of Stage 1 and Stage 2. If you back that out, we were running in probably the low-40s in 2020.
18


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
As we think about 2022, there may well be some reserve releases in that guidance. But I do think if the world is
recovering out of COVID, we should be able to operate at or below 30 basis points for 2022 onwards for a few
years until the cycle turns again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Okay. Thank you. And just on the other question â€“ thanks for the clarification on the 2022. The total distributions, I
know you're leaving room for some bolt-on acquisitions you said in your 55% maximum payout. I'm just thinking if
there aren't any acquisition opportunities at all. Would you be prepared to distribute everything else that kept you
within the 14% to the 14.5% target range [ph] on your core equity (01:18:10) Tier 1?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So the important thing is the first call on any excess capital will be to try and use it to drive growth, but
profitable growth, in our strategically important markets in a focused way. And then if we don't see opportunity for
growth, then we do reserve the option of buybacks. But I think it's too early to make that call at this point in time.
So I think we will clearly look to use the capital in profitable growth in the focused areas and resort to buybacks if
we don't have a realistic opportunity for profitable deployment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, and also remember, Tom, and what I was talking about in one of the previous questions is, yeah, there will
not be â€“ there will still be some decent amount of RWA inflation in both 2022 and 2023 coming from regulatory
change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think the important change we've made with this dividend policy is to provide an opportunity to both generate
strong return and strong growth for the bank. And that's what we try to position with the dividend policy going
forward.

Good morning, gents. Thanks for the questions. So, just a couple, please. Can I just confirm quickly on the cost
targets that you've given in 2022? Does it include anything for French retail and the North American retail

business that's currently under review, or should we be looking to kind of adjust those targets incrementally for
anything that may or may not get announced?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
That's not included within our cost targets. Any actions on those two areas would be incremental.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So there'll be a loss of revenue as well. So you need to take both of those into account.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Okay. Cool. [ph] Can I just ask (01:20:23) then on cost management more broadly then? I mean how are we
thinking about the cost â€“ managing that cost base? I mean are you looking to target jaws as well as given the kind
of absolute cost target, if the revenue environment doesn't come through, are you looking to manage it on a jaws
basis? Should we be looking at cost/income ratios? I mean how are you thinking about cost flex if the revenues
don't come through?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll give you a couple of comments first and then I'll ask Ewen to go into more detail. But we're targeting an
absolute cost number in the medium term. And on a constant currency basis, that is now $30 billion. When we
talked a year ago, we talked about $31 billion in 2022. We're now talking $30 billion on a constant currency basis
in the medium term. But that is also having taken into account a willingness to invest. So, that $30 billion is post
investment. And clearly, we're investing in the business because we see growth opportunities. And we believe it's
right for the bank to invest in those growth opportunities.
Now clearly, that's a dynamic we have to keep under watch as to how much growth is starting to return into the
economy and how much growth we should be investing in. But that target absolute number we've given you is on
the assumption of growth and on the assumption of investing in growth and, in total, around about $6 billion over
the next five years in Asia.
But, Ewen, do you want to add any more?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean I actually think we've done a pretty good job on cost save in the last couple of years. Remember in
2018, we grew our cost base by about 5.5% in that year. Last year, we shrank it by 3%. That's a 8.5 percentage
point delta in the cost run rate. As Noel said, I mean, I think it really â€“ we're not targeting either jaws or â€“ what
we're targeting is to get returns up materially, and in order to do that, we need to control costs well. John talked
about earlier growing confidence internally about a very material productivity uplift that we can get from the
20

investment in technology. And that gets you on a very virtuous circle. The more productivity you drive, the more
affordability you have to invest.
But I mean also I think over the last couple of years, what you've also seen is we've been flexible. If we'd seen
growth come down, revenue projections come down, we've adjusted our cost trajectory. So we think we have got
a decent amount of growth ahead of us, and we think the cost plans that we set out are realistic for that cost â€“ for
that revenue trajectory. But if things change, we'll change our cost plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And the other important thing. When you look at the slides, you'll notice there below the number in absolute terms
remains the same from 2022 onwards at about $30 billion on a constant currency basis, $31 billion on an FX-
adjusted basis. The nature of that cost changes. So you're seeing a higher proportion of that cost base going into
investment and technology. That's the red part of that bar chart. And you're seeing the BAU run costs, the
operating costs, become a smaller percentage of that total cost base.
And that for me is where we then start to get the payback in terms of return on capital because we're deploying
more of our investment into taking out bad costs, investing in the good cost that can drive revenue and drive
enhanced customer experience. And that's the balancing act that we're trying to achieve.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
A couple of questions from Ronit Ghose from Citigroup. First one is on the wealth business. The wealth business
in Hong Kong is up and obviously doing very strong. Why do you think your wealth business in Asia, excluding
Hong Kong, has been less strong and what should we do incrementally about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think it's a great question and, to be honest, I don't think we've invested enough outside of Hong Kong and
outside of China in the past. And that's why, over the next three to five years, we're embarking upon a material
investment program, 50% of which will be deployed outside of Hong Kong and China. So, that's an important
aspect of why we think we can succeed.
The other thing I'd say on success is we're investing on a platform that is already very, very successful in Hong
Kong. So we've taken the learnings from there and taken them elsewhere, and we've taken the clients that we've
fostered in Asia in our Commercial Banking and Global Banking business. And we're working â€“ and we're taking
those clients into our Wealth business. So we're investing on an already successful platform.
Just to give you some statistics from 2020, 60% of the private banking net new money that came into the private
bank last year came from our wholesale banking relationships, Commercial Banking and Global Banking. And
75% of the net new money from our asset management business last year came from those same very â€“ those
same sources â€“ Commercial Banking and Global Banking.
21

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
Now, across Asia including South and Southeast Asia, we have a very successful Commercial and Global
Banking business which we're also investing in. And we see that as a source of growth for our wealth business as
we put resources on the ground and as we enhance our product capability in wealth, in asset management, and
insurance. So, that's why I think we can drive growth at a faster rate than we have done historically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
And the second question is more of a technical question again from Ronit from Citi. Given your strong capital
position, why you're not paying quarterly dividends this year, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen, do you want to pick up that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, I mean, I think a couple of reasons. I mean, firstly on our side, just caution. I mean, I would note that
we are coming out of a 1 in a 100-year recessionary event and we're not out of it yet. So we're pretty pleased with
how we managed our capital resources last year, but we do see value in having strong capital ratios at the
moment as we recover out of COVID.
I think secondly also just from a regulatory perspective, you would all know that the annual cyclical scenario didn't
get run by the Bank of England at the back end of last year. We're sort of in the middle of running that stress test
at the moment. And yeah, I think the news coming out of the UK overnight was pretty positive around COVID, so
we're not expecting any surprises out of that. But I think we'll take â€“ yeah, we'll pay one interim dividend this year
in the middle of the year, if we can. And then we'll revisit the approach to quarterly versus semiannual dividends
next year.

Yeah, morning, everybody. Thanks very much. Ewen, I just had a quick question really on the targets and in
particular [indiscernible] (01:27:41) word you used, but you said that if we were to redo our forecasts for the
current exchange rate, we should add about $1 billion of costs for 2021. Does the same go for revenue? And I'm
thinking obviously about consensus, but obviously the revenue you mentioned was about $1.6 billion higher. It
would have been if you had it at the current exchange rate. So, should we be thinking about that when we're
looking at our forecast for 2021 as well? Thanks.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
Yeah. When we looked at consensus, it was obviously hard for us to know whether or not a weakening dollar had
been picked up. We thought it probably hadn't in most people's forecast that we published a few weeks ago. But
as I said, if you would use average January exchange rate for last year, revenues would have been $1.6 billion
higher and costs would have been $1.1 billion higher. So, as you work your numbers, I think you definitely have to
think about the impact of the weak dollar. It also impacts why we're sticking with a $31 billion cost target for 2022
which we think is $1 billion higher than what it was previously. And amongst that $1.6 billion of revenue uplift, it's
roughly half and half across non-interest income and net interest income.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the commercial bank [ph] please (01:29:27). If I look at this
year, you delivered a 1% RoTE. And if I normalize for provisions, maybe you get that up to 7% or 8% [ph] and it's
(01:29:40) the biggest consumer of RWAs in the group divisionally and it will be the biggest consumer of tangible
equity. So, what's constraining the commercial bank in terms of its RoTE and how are you planning to focus on
that specifically? And then also specifically on the commercial bank, are you still planning to recycle the RWAs
out of US GBM and into US commercial? And if so, why? Would it not be better to think about a restructuring of
that US commercial business and maybe adding that to your capital return plan? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Manus, thank you. Firstly, the commercial banking RoTE in 2020 was impacted by two things. Firstly, the IFRS
line provisions which you've drawn attention to and you would need to normalize for that; and secondly, the
impact of lower interest rates on what is a very liquid balance sheet in commercial banking. So it had a material
impact on the revenue of commercial banking in 2020.
Now, we're looking to reposition that aspect of the revenue decline by a greater focus on fee income, a greater
focus on repricing some of the asset book and driving greater collaboration with some of the GBM and fee income
product range which we've had a very successful track record of doing particularly in 2020, cross-selling more
capital market opportunities to CMB clients, more trade generated fee income products to CMB clients and more
M&A activity as well. We were particularly successful on that in the UK and in Asia, but it's still early days on that
transition into a low interest rate environment and rebooting other sources of revenue and fee income for
commercial banking.
With respect to the commercial bank in the US, actually pre-COVID, that was generating good returns both within
the US, and when you add in the cross-border referrals to other parts of the world, the inherent return from our
commercial banking clients in the US was strong. So I don't think strategically that is an underperforming business
23


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
the way we have an underperforming business in retail banking in the US and it's one that we think can continue
to generate good returns going forward as the economies normalize after COVID.

Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Thanks, Noel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, Manus. Maybe just one other thing to add. Yeah, as you model it too, I think customer activity was pretty
muted in a number of areas. So you'll see in some of the fee income lines, they were pretty depressed last year.
And again, we would expect those to recover as activity recovers.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Perhaps, if I can start on the tangible equity
allocation slide again, I'm just trying to understand this 2 percentage point shift per year that you're talking about
to get to about 50% Asia over time long term. What are the constraints to going faster than that? Do you think
that's the sort of addressable market? And obviously, your franchise in Asia looks very strong too. Is that the
fastest you can go within the addressable market of Asia or are there other constraints that we can't really think of
right now which might be bringing maybe some conservatism in there? And also, does that assume the US is [ph]
bold (01:33:26) in terms of your sort of target mix of the businesses? And I've got a second one on NIM, if that's
okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Let me just clarify a couple of comments on the reallocation of tangible equity. What we talked about was a
reallocation of around about 800 basis points essentially from West to East. We also said there was a reallocation
of tangible equity by business line as well and that's about 1,000 basis point or 10 percentage point shift out of
Global Banking and Markets utilizing that equity into other business lines such as Wealth and Commercial
Banking. And those two things obviously overlap to a degree. It's coming from the West principally out of Global
Banking and Markets in the US and Continental Europe which are low return markets for us relative to the return
opportunity in Asia.
24


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 23-Feb-2021
So we're in the process of, as we said, running down parts of our book in the US and Europe and reinvesting
those saved RWAs into Asia. And that's got to be done in an orderly manner. It can't be â€“ and we've made good
progress on that. 50% are gross RWA savings in the first year alone. So I think you should view it as we're pulling
the RWAs out of a lower return business, Global Banking and Markets; in lower return geographies, Europe and
US; and redeploying into Asia in Wealth and Commercial Banking and in global banking in Asia.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Got it. Thank you. The second one I guess was more on NIM and [ph] I'm wondering if Ewen wants to tackle
(01:35:13) this one. I was just wondering if you think HBAP NIM has now stabilized. It was only down 2 basis
points in the last quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, I mean, as you know, Raul, the HBAP NIM is very short dated in both the asset and liability side. So both
sides effectively repriced both on a one- or three-month basis. And it's highly dependent on the path of near-term
HIBOR which continues to be very volatile. So I would be hesitant to say that we've reached the bottom. I mean
certainly so far this year, HIBOR has been very, very weak. I think we're more optimistic that there was some
upside during the year, but I'm not going to predict the path of HIBOR and say that we're â€“ there's no further
weakness in NIM as a result in HBAP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Got it, Ewen. But if I look at slide 45 where you've got your HIBOR assumptions laid out, I think you've got 43
basis points on HIBOR up from 12 basis points and then rising up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, no, no, but I've noted it's also been 13 basis points so far in Q1, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Great. And I was just wondering whether other factors apart from HIBOR might be more at play here, but it
sounds like HIBOR is still the main driver.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
HIBOR is still â€“ we've repriced most of the liabilities at this point. There's probably some modest, but the biggest
driver of that NIM will be the trajectory of HIBOR this year.

I've got a couple of written questions which I'll read out [ph] well, I'll just say the return on equity (01:36:59)
reallocation is organic. A couple of questions, one from [ph] Winston Pang (01:37:33) of Manulife in Hong Kong.
How do we measure the success of your digital investments in terms of increased revenues, costs or risk
management, what are the sort of mix if we should measure the success of your digital investments, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think it's a great question, I think we need to do more on disclosure on the return. We get in on those digital
investments. I mean we measure that internally. We have every project tracked, understanding the digital
penetration rates, the automation that's taking place. But I think we should share more of that information with you
as we go forward.
John, is there anything you'd like to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Hinshaw A
Group Chief Operating Officer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, a couple of thoughts. I mean, we have a technology strategy that spans the bank that is aligned with every
single business objective both on the revenue side and the cost side and the risk management side. I think your
question, [ph] Winston, (01:37:50) asked about all three and there is a very extensive process and an ongoing
process to tick and tie all of those. So when you hear Peter talk about growth in Asia, there's technology that
underpins that. When you hear Nuno talk about the wealth program, that's all connected to the technology
objectives. When you hear our cost targets, there are specific technology objectives to take those costs out. And
we are investing a lot in operational resilience as well from the risk management perspective. So, as Noel says,
we got all that internally. Happy to share that as appropriate in more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean if I sort of look at what we're doing in finance as an example, yeah, it really depends on the project
and the metrics. So we're putting all of our reporting onto the cloud and creating a single data set as part of that
over the next few years. Yeah, we've done liquidity reporting over the last year or so. We're just starting on risk-
weighted assets in one of the markets at the moment. Yeah, we're processing 18 times more data, 8 times faster,
so 150 times improvement. We've taken out a whole bunch of manual intervention. So the control environment
materially improved. And we think when we finish their project, we'll be able to take cost down and finance by a
third. But the main benefits are going to be much, much better MI, much better reporting and a much better
control environment together with the significant uplift in productivity. So we're tracking all of the above on that
project.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Let me give you a couple of facts just quickly, but these are the sort of things we should probably share more
regularly with you. 90% of our personal banking transactions globally are on a digital platform. We had 1.28 billion
logins to our personal banking mobile apps in 2020. We had over 10.5 million chat conversations with our
personal banking customers last year online, and we had nearly 120,000 downloads of the HSBCnet corporate
treasury mobile app which we recently developed and upgraded in 2020. That represented around about a 150%
improvement year-on-year on its utilization rates. Now, they're the sort of things that we're tracking on how digital
investment is transforming the way we do business, but we'll come back to you and share more information on
future updates.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, I think the only thing to add to that, the other side of it is also a very meaningful shift that obviously got
accelerated last year in a reduction in traditional banking. So cash transactions across the ATMs and branches
were down 25% last year. Contact center volumes and what we describe as traditional contact center
conversations were down 11%. So, one thing COVID has done, I think, is dramatically shift away from some of
the old economy stuff towards digital.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Second question from the written questions from Yafei Tian from Citigroup in Hong Kong. Can you cite a bit better
for us the opportunity in the Pinnacle and wealth investments particularly in the Greater Bay Area? Are we talking
about hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars? Can you give us a bit of quantification there, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Nuno, do you want to pick up some of your thoughts? It's still early days on Pinnacle, but do you want to share
some of the early results and what you see?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nuno A. Matos A
Chief Executive, Wealth and Personal Banking, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. So, in Mainland China, as we know, we launched the Pinnacle Wealth Venture. We started with the first
foreign fintech license in Mainland China, by the way. In the first six months, we hired 200 wealth planners. They
are very well equipped and trained. They are performing above expectations at this moment both in terms of the
value of the business and ticket size. We expect to scale up by 3,000 by 2025 and cover 10 cities. And by the
way, this year we expect to scale up that number by another 600. We believe we can do it. And what I would like
to call the attention is this is not just an insurance strategy. This is a wealth strategy, okay? And that's the way we
are actually growing in Southeast Asia, in Mainland China. It's a non-mass market, non-branch-based strategy.
It's a digital-enabled strategy with personal wealth planners.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Is there anything that you can share with us on what you see as the opportunity for wealth in China for HSBC
particularly in the Greater Bay Area?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nuno A. Matos A
Chief Executive, Wealth and Personal Banking, HSBC Holdings Plc
In February, there's an MoU signed between PBOC, CBIRC between them and also with Hong Kong and Macau.
What the MoU is about is about mutual investment between the Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong. And that will
have substantial potential for us. The Pinnacle project that we're doing right now is actually also getting ready for
that because when the investment â€“ when the mutual investment is pushed between the two â€“ is pushed between
Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong, we're the leading bank in Hong Kong with the quality products and we're also
the leading foreign bank in China. And so the Pinnacle will work very well with the strategy because they will be
selling wealth planning in the Greater Bay Area.

Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Good morning, afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. The first one was just on NII and building on some
of your previous comments. The first about being on interest-earning assets. If we take the Q4 position, adjust the
FX, then reflect some loan growth as you suggested for later this year, would it be fair to assume interest-earning
asset should be up quite meaningfully versus the Q4 position at least in dollar terms, perhaps of mid-single digit?
And then on the NIM, obviously it grew in Q4, but you pointed to some headwinds from HIBOR, et cetera. If one
was to assume mid-single-digit reduction in NIM from here given that interest-earning asset balance growth, it
seemed to point to the 3%, 4% uplift to consensus NII in 2021, just trying to get a sense as to whether that
sounds reasonable or whether I'm being a bit too optimistic given where HIBOR is on sort of back end nature of
the loan growth this year.
And then just a quick follow-up on RWAs, thank you very much for the disclosure on the $40 billion to $50 billion
regulatory headwinds. Just wondering whether you might be able to break that down at all between FRTB, other
Basel III components, and other regulatory changes? And is there anything sort of beyond 2023 we should be
factoring in [indiscernible] (01:45:32) anything sort of residual beyond that 5% you would expect to be much less
in magnitude? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, on [indiscernible] (01:45:43), yes, that will have an impact on us on the current modeling in about
2027/2028, but it's a long time away and we would expect to have done work on how would we mitigate some of
that impact. So I think I've given you all of the inputs out to 2023. I am not going to comment on the individual
breakdown of all of that into a subcomponent part.
But on net interest income, yeah, relative to consensus, I guess just two things I'd note. One is I don't think
consensus as it was modeled or as we disclosed included the impact of dollar weakness which we think would
have added about $800 million. So I don't know where that was in your numbers. And I think we are more
optimistic, as you would expect us to be but probably more optimistic than consensus, which had quite low loan
growth this year, but some of the other headwinds, I think, would act as a partial counterweight to some of that.

Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi, and thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the details there. Just two quick ones. I guess
tangentially on NIM. The first one is your rate sensitivity on a 12-month basis has gone up. It looks like it's pretty
much all in the UK. Can I just understand what's really driven that and why you don't think your US rate sensitivity
would have gone up as well and in Hong Kong as well, of course.
And my second question was just, an earlier answer you gave on the commercial business talking about asset
repricing as being one of the pillars of revenue growth. Normally, when we see an excess liquidity, we've seen the
opposite in the sense that actually competition brings margins down. Can I just understand, like, what do you see
on the ground of underlying asset margin competition given, I guess, very high liquidity across the board, all of
your peers both global and local? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, just we are seeing some early signs of asset repricing taking place particularly in Asia. I don't want to
overpromise on the quantum of that, but we are seeing some early signs of that in the second half of last year. So
we do believe that is a viable option for mitigating some of the overall pressures on NIM from lower interest rates.
And Ewen?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, I think in the UK, again, in the mortgage market, actually we've seen better spreads and actually our share
of new business has gone up. And so, yeah, I mean, we're not â€“ it's not on the come. We are actually seeing
improved asset side margins in a number of parts of the business at the moment.
Yeah, on the interest rate sensitivity in the UK, I think it was mainly driven by higher short-term asset and liabilities
balances particularly on the liability side which has gone up materially. If you look at the liquidity in the UK, it's
very, very strong at the moment.

Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Thank you. Actually, a follow-up. How do you reconcile, I guess, looking ahead the high liquidity you're talking
about the UK and then obviously in Asia where you have sustainable asset repricing? What do you think is
different this time for us to kind of think, okay, repricing can hold and stay there with that much liquidity around?
Thanks.

I went through the GFC and life after the GFC, and we saw our asset repricing taking place there as well. And I
think Peter, your track record in Asia of dealing with low interest rates environment post GFC, do you just want to
share some of your thoughts about how you've handled that in the past?

Peter Wong Tung Shun A
Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive-The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. We remember back in after the Lehman crisis, the interest rate scenario was extremely low. However, we
were able to â€“ between 2010 to 2019, our total income went up on a compounded basis by 6%. If we look at 2016
to 2019, it would be 9%. So we're accustomed to dealing with a low interest rate environment and we're able to
reprice our asset â€“ our asset portfolio and also change the mix of our deposit portfolio.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Back to you, Noel, to sum up. Thank you.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, thank you very much for your questions and for taking the time to be with us. I just want to remind you of
some of the key messages we shared with you earlier in the morning. First, we have executed our promises in
2020. And second, we will do the same again in 2021. We're pleased that we've been able to reactivate dividends
and we've tried to position the new dividend policy to be able to support both good yields and good growth.
And for that growth, we're willing to invest in the businesses. We're confident in our ability to drive growth even in
a low interest rate environment and we're willing to invest to make it happen. And that investment program is
material and it's different from what we've done in the past.
We look forward to discussing our plans with you on our progress over the coming weeks and months. Richard
and the team are available to you if you have any further questions. But in the meantime, stay safe and have a
good day or good evening wherever you are. Thank you very much.
