Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Paul and I are joining you from Orlando, Florida. We have
over 4,000 people attending our Independent Advisors Conference. It's great to see such an upbeat mood and
people really having a good time getting back together, as well as all the other educational sessions we have
here.
Since our founding over 60 years ago, Raymond James has maintained an unwavering commitment to placing
clients first through conservative decision-making that keeps us well-positioned over the long term. While
remaining focused on the long term has not always been easy or fully appreciated in good times, it has served us
very well over time. And it's times such as these, when even the financial system itself is challenged, that our
philosophy not only carries us through but enables us to thrive.
Just a few examples of our differentiated positioning that we've benefit recently from includes Tier 1 leverage
capital ratio of 11.5% over 2 times the regulatory requirement to be well-capitalized. 88% of our bank deposits are
FDIC-insured, including nearly 95% of Raymond James Bank, amongst the highest in the entire industry, And A
level rating with all three credit agencies, which Fitch reaffirmed in March at the height of the turmoil.
A few weeks later, we were able to renew and upsize our five-year committed revolver with enhanced terms,
thanks to the fantastic relationship we have with all of our bank partners. Further, we were able to buy back $350
million of shares at what we believe were attractive prices, and we still have $1.1 billion of capacity remaining
under our board authorization. In times like these, we are reminded of the importance of keeping a long-term
client-focused approach and our stakeholders benefit and appreciate the firm's dedication to placing them first.
Now, turning to our results, despite the challenging market and the high market volatility during the first six
months of the fiscal year, we generated record net revenues and record earnings. Reviewing second quarter
results starting on slide 4, the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion and net income available
to common shareholders of $425 million or $1.93 per diluted share.
Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $446
million or $2.03 per diluted share. The increase in interest-related revenues driven by short-term interest rates
drove significant earnings growth over the prior year. Net revenues increased 7% and net income available to
common shareholders grew 32%.
And despite the challenging market conditions and our robust capital position, we generated strong returns with
annualized return on common equity of 70.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of
22.3%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Moving to slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.2 trillion. PCG assets in
fee-based accounts of $666 billion and financial assets under management of $194 billion. With our continuing
focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high quality financial advisors, PCG consistently generates strong
organic growth, which is evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of $21.5 billion, representing an
8.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.
During the prior 12 months, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels,
financial advisors with approximately $275 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $38 billion of client assets at
their previous firms. Total clients' domestic sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$52.2 billion, down 14% from December of 2022. The sequential decline reflects the expected cash sorting
activity, which was partially offset by the launch of our Enhanced Savings Program.
We are pleased with the early success of our Enhanced Savings Program. This product offered to PCG clients
the Raymond James Bank is a fantastic option for clients seeking competitive rates while maintaining a high level
of FDIC insurance. We believe this product is really unique in the industry and certainly appealing in the current
environment. As of this week, Enhanced Savings Program balances have surpassed $4.5 billion. Total bank loans
decreased 1% from the preceding quarter to $44 billion, primarily reflecting a modest decline in securities-based
loans due to higher interest rate environment. We will touch on this more later on the call. But we plan to remain
very prudent with growing our corporate loans over the next several months given volatile market conditions.
Moving to slide 6. Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.14 billion and
pre-tax income of $441 million. Year-over-year asset-based revenues declined due to market declines. However,
PCG's results were listed by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees.
As Paul Shoukry will explain in more detail, this quarter was negatively impacted by some seasonal expenses, as
well as elevated legal costs. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $302 million and a
pre-tax loss of $34 million. Revenues declined 27% compared to the prior-year quarter, mostly driven by lower
investment banking revenues, as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues.
The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for investment banking, has strained the near-term
profitability of the segment. However, we are focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues
are depressed.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $82 million on net revenues of $216 million. The
year-over-year decreases in net revenue and pre-tax income were largely attributable to lower assets and fee-
based accounts, as net inflows into fee-based accounts and to the Private Client Group are offset by market
declines. Solid net inflows for Raymond James Investment Management helped boost financial assets under
management, which should provide a tailwind in the fiscal third quarter.
The Bank segment generated record net revenues of $540 million and pre-tax income of $91 million. Revenue
growth was largely due to the continued expansion of the Bank's net interest margin to 3.63% for the quarter, up
162 basis points over the year-ago quarter and 27 basis points from the preceding quarter. The NIM expansion
reflected the flexible and floating nature of our balance sheet. Although as Paul Shoukry will explain, we do
expect some headwinds to NIM, which reached very high levels across the industry over the past couple of
months.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $5.66 billion and record
net income available to common shareholders of $932 million, up 4% and 21%, respectively, over the prior year's
4

record. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 19.3% and annualized adjusted
return on tangible common equity of 24.2% for the six-month period.
On slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects the strong
organic growth in PCG and the benefit of higher interest related revenues whereas the weaker capital markets
results reflected the challenging environment for investment banking and brokerage revenues especially when
compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period.
And now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of the second quarter
financials. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting on slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $2.87 billion in the second
quarter, up 7% over the prior year and 3% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a
period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having
diversified and complementary businesses.
Asset management and related administrative fees declined 11% compared to the prior-year quarter and
increased 5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter,
partially offset by fewer billable days in the fiscal second quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets grew 5%,
providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter. Brokers'
revenues of $496 million declined 12% year-over-year and grew 2% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was
largely due to lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG, as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the
Capital Markets segment.
I'll discuss account service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $154 million
declined 34% year-over-year and grew 9% sequentially. As experienced across the industry, M&A revenues were
particularly challenged this quarter, declining 37% year-over-year and 15% sequentially.
Despite a healthy banking pipeline, a solid new business activity, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace
and timings of deals launching and closing, given the heightened market volatility. It remains too difficult to say
when conditions will become conducive to increase investment banking revenues.
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$52.2 billion, down 14% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.9% of domestic PCG client
assets.
The Enhanced Savings Program added approximately $2.7 billion in new deposits in March as the offering was
only open to net new balances until April. And a good portion of these new balances were derived from brand-
new clients to the firm, following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, highlighting the attractiveness of this product
and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability. As Paul said, the Enhanced Savings
Program balances exceeded $4.5 billion this week, continuing to grow nicely and partially offsetting the
anticipated decline in sweep balances largely due to the quarterly fee billings in April.
Whilst difficult to parse through the disclosures to make sure we are comparing apples to apples, of the handful of
peers who have reported thus far, we estimate year-over-year cash sweep declines for those peers were
approximately 35% to 45%. This compares to a 35% year-over-year decline in our domestic sweep balances in
5

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
March. So this dynamic of declining sweep balances has really been the experience of roughly the same order of
magnitude for most of the firms in our industry. And as most of you know, we have been expecting,
communicating and preparing for this sorting activity for quite some time.
Looking forward, we expect additional cash sorting activity although we believe we are much closer to the end of
that dynamic than we are at the beginning if rates settle out in near-term levels. As the average sweep balance
per account over the approximately 3.4 million accounts domestically is now less than $15,000. And we hope to
continue to offset any further cash sorting activities through our diversified funding sources, including the
Enhanced Savings Program, TriState deposit franchise and other initiatives. And when the sorting dynamic does
stabilize, we would then expect to grow sweep balances given our strong organic rate in PCG.
Meanwhile, to be prudent, we would strive to maintain a strong funding cushion of domestic cash swept to third-
party banks, not too much lower than where it ended the March quarter. We would also plan to keep elevated
cash balances in the Bank segment, which grew from $1.8 billion in December to $5 billion at the end of the fiscal
second quarter. While these actions don't optimize net interest margin over the short term, we believe they give
us the most flexibility over the long term.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $731 million, up
226% over the prior year quarter and 1% over the preceding quarter, as the sequential decrease in RJBDP fees
from third-party banks was more than offset by higher firm-wide net interest income.
The Bank segment's net interest margin increased 27 basis points sequentially to 3.63% for the quarter, and the
average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 53 basis points to 3.25%. Our longstanding
approach of maintaining a high concentration of floating rate assets not only helped drive more immediate upside
to higher short-term interest rates, but also preserve a relatively flexible balance sheet compared to the banks that
have much higher concentration of duration risk.
Looking forward, we expect combined net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline
sequentially in fiscal third quarter due to a decrease in third-party RJBDP fees, given the lower average balances
with third-party banks.
We would also expect the Bank segment's NIM to contract from the second quarter, given the higher level of cash
balances we plan to maintain during this volatile period, as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding
sources. But as we have always said, instead of focusing on maximizing NIM, we are focused on preserving
flexibility and growing net interest income over the long term, which we still believe we are well-positioned to do
after the cash sorting dynamic is behind us. But near term, we expect headwinds for the net interest income and
RJBDP fees for the reasons I just explained.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13, compensation expense was $1.8 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.3%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.8% during the quarter.
The compensation ratio continues to benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party
banks. The sequential increase in compensation reflects higher revenues, as well as the impact of salary
increases effective on January 1, along with the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. we
are very pleased to generate a 62.8% adjusted compensation ratio, given these factors, and the extremely
challenging market environment for capital markets.
Non-compensation expenses of $496 million increased 25% sequentially. Adjusting for acquisition-related non-
compensation expenses and a favorable settlement received in the fiscal first quarter, which are all including our
6

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
non-GAAP earning adjustments, non-compensation expenses grew 16% during the quarter. This increase was
largely driven by higher legal and regulatory costs, including an unfavorable arbitration award totaling $20 million,
along with higher communication and information processing expenses which reflect continued technology
investments and the seasonal impact of year-end mailings.
The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $28 million largely reflects the charge-off of a C&I loan
that's been challenged for several quarters, as well as higher allowances in the CRE portfolio. I'll discuss more
related to the credit quality in the Bank segment shortly.
In summary, we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest and grow and ensuring high
service levels for advisors and their clients. While there's been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory
expenses this quarter and there are always some seasonal expenses that hit in the first calendar quarter of the
year, none of the non-compensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last
provided guidance for the fiscal year, but legal and regulatory expenses are inherently difficult to predict.
Slide 14 shows a pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pre-tax
margin of 19.4%, an adjusted pre-tax margin of 20.4%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges
impacting capital markets.
On slide 15, at quarter end, total assets were $79 billion, a 3% sequential increase, largely reflecting the $3.2
billion increase of cash balances in the Bank segment during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remained very
strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. A tier
1 leverage ratio of 11.5% and total capital ratio of 21.4% are both more than double the regulatory requirements
to be well-capitalized. The 11.5% tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital above our
conservative 10% target, which would still be two times the regulatory requirement to be well-capitalized. Our
capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.
We were pleased to have our A- credit rating, reaffirmed by Fitch in mid-March. In the announcement, Fitch cited
the firm's strong capital cushion, significant deposit funding, and access to unsecured debt markets, among other
drivers as reason for the rating.
Also in April, we renewed our revolving credit facility and expanded it from $500 million to $750 million. Our strong
balance sheet and longstanding relationships with our banking partners enabled us to upsize the five-year
committed corporate revolver with enhanced terms to further strengthen our contingent liquidity sources.
The ability to execute this facility in a challenging market environment is a testament to our long-term
conservative approach. I know many of our bankers are listening on this call, so I'd like to thank all of you for your
continued support and partnership.
We also have other significant sources of contingent funding. For example, just to be proactive, given the market
uncertainty in March, we increased our FHLB borrowings in the Bank segment by only $500 million from
December 31 to March 31. And given our strong cash position, we've already paid $200 million of that down in
April. That leaves us more than $9 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.
Slide 16 provide a summary of capital actions over the past five quarters. During the fiscal second quarter, the
firm repurchased 3.75 million shares of common stock for $350 million at an average price of $93 per share. As of
April 26, approximately $1.1 billion were made available under the board's approved common stock repurchase
authorization, and we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we discussed previously,

particularly as this market volatility has provided attractive opportunities for us, and we don't plan on using as
much capital to support balance sheet growth over the next three to six months.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for the Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of our loan portfolio remains healthy. Criticized loans as a
percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 0.92%. The bank loan allowance for credit
losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 0.94%. The bank loan allowance
for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.67% at quarter
end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of
inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates, and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio.
I know there's been a lot of attention on commercial real estate across the industry, given the challenges with
property value and interest rates. So, let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE
and REIT loans of approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of our total loans. Our office portfolio is only
17% of these real estate loans. So, our office portfolio only represents approximately 3.5% of the Bank segment
total loans.
And based on the underwriting and origination, along with the most recent appraisals, the average loan to value of
this office portfolio is somewhere around 60%, which is probably a little bit higher now given pressure on
valuations in the industry, but still providing us a lot of cushion on this portfolio on average. Overall, we have
deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate and we underwrote office loans with what we believe were
conservative criteria. But we continue to monitor each loan closely, given the industry-wide challenges.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul, and as I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first six months of fiscal
2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market. And while
there is still a lot of near-term economic uncertainty, we are in a position of strength and I believe we are well-
positioned to drive growth over the long-term across all of our businesses.
In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of
assets and fee-based accounts. However, we do expect to have some headwinds from lower RJBDP fees from
third-party banks, given lower average balances.
Focusing more on the long term, I'm optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth, as current and
prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and our leading technology and product solutions.
For example, in our current advisor recruiting pipeline, we have several commitments from teams with $5 million
to $20 million of annual production.
In the Capital Markets segment, while M&A pipelines remain healthy and engagement levels are good, the pace
and timing of launching and closing transactions will be challenged until market conditions stabilize. And in the
fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available
for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. However, [indiscernible] (00:30:25)
enhances our position, as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility and has produced excellent
results since joining us.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
While we expect continued industry wide challenges over the next couple of quarters, over the long term, we are
well-positioned across the Capital Markets business for growth, given the investments we've made over the past
five years, which has significantly increased our productive capacity and market share. We will continue to
prudently manage expenses in these businesses, as the near-term revenues continue to come under pressure.
Obviously, we will take more significant actions if the industry headwinds prove to be more long term.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter up 5%
compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive
throughout the fiscal third quarter. We remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts in
the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.
In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management, which generated solid net inflows this quarter,
to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies.
And in the Bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet
with diversified funding sources.
While we'll continue to support our PCG clients when their demand for loans eventually recover, we will be very
prudent in growing corporate loans given market uncertainty. We believe there will be a more attractive
opportunities in the future if spreads widen to reflect the higher cost of funding and/or higher premium required for
credit risk across the entire banking industry. And just as we did during uncertain market environments in the
past, we have been and will continue to be opportunistic in selling certain loans to further de-risk the corporate
portfolio, especially when we believe the secondary market prices do not fully reflect the downside risks.
So overall, our approach in the Bank segment over the next three to six months is to build as much dry powder as
possible for what we believe will be a more attractive and opportunistic environment for loan growth in fiscal 2024.
In closing, we believe we are well-positioned with strong prospects for future growth and ample cash and liquidity.
On certain times like these are when clients need trusted advice the most, and I want to thank our advisors and
their associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each
and every day. The strength and stability of our firm is a direct reflection of your commitment. So, thank you all for
all you do.
And with that, operator, that concludes my remarks and we'll open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment, please, for the first question. The first question
comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Good afternoon, Paul and Paul. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Good. I hopped on a minute late, but yeah, the question Just on the net interest income outlook, I just want to
make sure I understood the commentary. So, is the expectation that it's going to take a near-term step-back and
then can grow off of whatever that new base is, or Paul, are you saying that you'll kind of resume growth off of the
fiscal second quarter level? And I guess related, I heard that you're going to operate, I think, with higher reserves.
So, just how much of a drag is that and I guess what would make you comfortable bringing that down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I'll let the other Paul go through the NIM, but I don't think we anticipate right now higher reserves, but then,
reserve cash maybe, we'll be carrying a little more cash, but I don't know which reserve you're referring to. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. I was referring to the cash reserve, which is the cash liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Oh. Yes. There's more cash in the bank. Go ahead, Paul. I'll let...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we did increase the cash balances at the bank, just given the volatility in March. We thought it would be
prudent. So we finished the quarter by, I think, $5 billion. So, we were up $4 billion for the quarter, ending the
quarter at $5 billion of cash at the Bank segment. And so, that is a drag on NIM because you're earning closer to
10


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
5% on that versus the 7-or-so-percent we're earning on new loans that we're putting on the book. But we think
that's prudent just given the volatility.
And in terms of the outlook going forward, near term, we do expect a pullback of net interest income and BDP
fees when you look at those on a combined basis. We plan on keeping the cash swept to third-party banks at
around the card level. Just because we think that $9 billion gives us a nice cushion. It also offers clients maximum
FDIC insurance, which we all know is really important for clients right now. And so, by doing that, even at $9
billion, those fees are probably going to be down. Average balances will be down 25% sequentially. And so, those
fees will be down 25% roughly depending on what happens with rates and other things. And then, the net interest
income will be pressured by having higher cash balances and then higher cost of funding that we raised since
launching the Enhanced Savings Program in March. So all net together, I think that would result in probably
somewhere around a 10% decline sequentially. And then, as we start growing balances from there, then that
would be probably a good jumping off point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Great color. I guess maybe just I want to follow-up on the same topic, and Paul, you just mentioned
the Enhanced Savings Program. Looks like you're having some nice success there. And I'm assuming that it's still
reasonably early in terms of the advisor penetration. So, just love to maybe talk about kind of the expectation for
growth there. And maybe would – could advisors be more active moving their customers' cash there in the near
term, just given that it's new, and so, that could pressure the, I guess, the rate on the liability side, or do you have
data that's just suggesting that the majority of the yield-seeking cash has already moved out of the accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would tell you, when we look at sort of the trends, it looks like a lot of the sorting activity, that the higher
yield-seeking activity has occurred. When we rolled out the Enhanced Savings Program in March, it was actually
to new money to the firm until we expanded it in April to certain security sales and new money to the bank. But we
raised $2.7 billion of brand new flows to the firm during the month of March, and most of it was mid-March during
the banking turmoil. So, we were pleased to see that those cash balances come in.
But even then, with – we're close to $5 billion today, these balances. That represents roughly 10% of the sweep
and enhanced yield savings balances, whereas most of our peers are at 50% of their balances being an
enhanced yield savings. So our relative cost of funds, when you look at those two balances together, is still very
attractive, even though we've been able to be more generous to clients on the sweep balances in terms of
passing on rates via the sweeps as well.
So, we feel like we're well-positioned. And right now, what we're really hoping to do is a lot of clients hold money
market fund positions and would prefer to have FDIC insurance. And so, a lot of those balances now are moving
to the enhanced yield savings, which we think is a really a win-win for the clients and the firm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yes. Got it. Okay. All very helpful. I will hop back in the queue [ph] with the other guys (00:39:37). Thanks so
much.

question.

Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. Maybe just a first question on the leverage ratio, obviously sitting at 11.5%. Just curious
whether you still feel that 10% target is a good level to think about as a near-term target, especially with the
macro environment and kind of the uncertainty that we're facing with the macro right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's the hard one to peg with. That's like happening today in the press even. We're going to be more
cautious until the industry is sorting down and that we see kind of a level field. We think that the 10% is a good
target, but in the short term, we're probably not going to be overaggressive to it, especially if we're not growing the
bank aggressively. We don't think that's the smart move right now. We will continue to let [ph] SPL (00:40:43)
balances and mortgage our client balances, fund those, those with priority. We're not sure it's a good time to get
into the increasing the corporate side of the lending right now just because of the market. So shorter term, I think
the capital ratio is going to be over the 10%, but we're not going to change the goal. But during the volatility like
we've seen with today's news and other things, we're going to be cautious till we're pretty comfortable the markets
settled down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
The only thing I would add to that is a lot of other banks have to worry about the impact of unrealized losses on
their securities portfolio. And we have some of those as well, obviously. But I think we would be north of 10%,
even if we factored in all of those losses because we kept duration relatively contained on our balance sheet. So,
we're in a position of strength when you look at our capital ratios and feel like we have a lot of flexibility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then, just maybe a follow-up question to that, just with your stock price where it's at today, obviously,
in the first quarter, calendar first quarter, you were up the buyback a bit here. But just wondering if you can kind of
compare the current valuation of your stock to maybe any opportunities that you're seeing in the M&A market. If
you kind of could expand upon some of those opportunities that you're seeing and what segments you're seeing
more opportunity in light of everything that's happened in the banking space as well, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. We've done a really good job of staying close to the people that we would like to join the firm, and those
opportunities are clearly up, and that includes the M&A and the private client space, again, whether they get
transactable because of price or other issues or some are more complex than others. But those conversations
that kind of went away, some have come back, but price adjustments of the buyer and the seller are always in line
in expectation with the market. We, as we've said in here, don't expect a near-term increase in our M&A volume
until this market settles out. I think lending has to kind of return, and that's not, our view, not going to happen until
we see interest rates settle and people get used to it. So – but we think there will be M&A opportunity. We have
both the capital and liquidity to handle that. Our balance sheet, as you know, is very leveraged and we have
access. So we're – as most downturns, we've been able to take advantage of the market. And our presumption is
12

we would be able to, but again, that all depends on buyers and sellers and opportunities and other factors in the
market.

Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. So, can we start with the outlook for NII? If I heard you correctly, I think you guys
are guiding to down 10% firm-wide NII. Can you help with some of the underlying assumptions in terms of NIM
firm-wide and maybe how are you thinking about the ultimate amount of cash that you need to run with on the
balance sheet? And obviously, it would be helpful to know what you're assuming for interest rates for the second
quarter underpinning that 10% decline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The 10% decline, Alex, includes the BDP fees as well. So, it's kind of a combined basis as we show it in the
presentation. And that factors in the 25-basis point increase that the market is expecting in May. And so, in terms
of the cash that we plan on holding on the bank's balance sheet, we plan on holding more than we need for –
during these volatile times, more than we hopefully need during these volatile times just to stay prudent. And as
Paul said, we're being deliberate and growing corporate loans and we're being actually opportunistic and selling
corporate loans. So, not much balance sheet growth forecasted over the next – at least during this period of
volatility.
And in some cases, for example, we've already sold over $400 million of corporate loans that we had rated lower
from a credit perspective, and we're able to get near par value for those loans. We had marks on them that were
higher than what the price we were able to get. So, we don't believe that the market's fully factoring in potentially
the downside risk on certain loans. And so, just as we've done in other volatile periods, we're sort of being
opportunistic knowing that we're just building dry powder, both capital, and hopefully, funding dry powder to
accelerate growth when the opportunities look more attractive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. Yeah. Combined makes a lot more sense. I appreciate that. My second question was around non-
comp expenses. And I appreciate that you guys think this is close to where you were budgeting for. But if we look
at non-comp, ex-provisions and backing out of the $20 million of the arbitration fee, it looks like it was up almost
$30 million sequentially. So, maybe help us reconcile what's driving the growth. And just given your outlook for
effectively peak rates, revenues in a challenging capital markets backdrop, when should we expect you guys to
become a little bit more aggressive on cost savings initiatives?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Yeah. The first two quarters are always a little bit lumpy in terms of the non-compensation expenses. So if you
look at it kind of on a combined basis, backing out the acquisition-related costs and backing out the loan loss
provision, which is how we made the guidance, it's around, I think, $830 million for the first six months of the year,
which actually trends lower than the $1.7 billion guidance I provided for the non-comp expenses, excluding
provision. So, we still – we're not changing that guidance for the time being because none of the – other than
legal and regulatory, which is inherently unpredictable, and we had a $20 million arbitration award, which we were
not expecting, obviously, this quarter, we are – most of the other line items are kind of coming in in line with what
we've forecasted when we provided that guidance. But of course, things change between now and the next six
months of the fiscal year. Then we certainly will update that and let you all know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that comparison was – looks bigger because of the $30 million last year...

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Last quarter recovery that we non-GAAP, too. But it's – we think they're in line, and yeah, legal fees certainly were
higher, that settlement was higher, but that's really driving and that's kind of lumpy. We think the run rate and the
guidance is still in the ballpark from what we can see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And with that being said, while it's coming in line with what we expected, we're also, given the market
environment, going to be very deliberate in managing all of those expenses while still investing in growth in high
service levels.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate you taking the question this evening. Maybe stepping back, and
perhaps, it's just too soon to tell, as you think about some of the structural changes that may evolve for the
banking industry on the side – the other side of the banking collapse and maybe your early stage conversation
with the regulators, how do you see the evolution for regulatory capital or leverage ratios? Does that affect your
10% bogey? And then maybe how you think about long-term growth in earning assets and the NIM associated
with that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, first, on capital, I think give it a 10%, we're well set over what anyone is – our competitors and other things.
We think that's still a very conservative target. We can't see any regulations that would make anything even close
to that. So, we'd still have buffer there. So, we're not worried about capital. Like everything, given the
environment, we've been focused on liquidity. That's why we rolled out the Enhanced Savings Program and are
very heartened that even after the quarter, we paid our $1.2 billion in asset management fees come out of there.
We had tax payments that usually go over $1 billion. Our cash balances are still steady. So on the liquidity side,
the question is just how much do we have to raise than the higher yielding programs. But we feel good about our
liquidity and not even touching our, really, our FHLB advances or that $9 billion buffer.
So third then becomes is when you start investing in that order, when you start investing in the growth in assets
and in the bank, and that, we're just going to have to decide. We're not going to be really aggressive. Where we
see opportunities, we could – we'll take them. If we see M&A opportunities we think are good, we'll act on them.
And we just don't think, given the banking market rising rates, and if people are predicting a recessionary
environment, it's the time to be very aggressive in growing corporate loans. So, I would say we're – our growth
plans are not really to expand the balance sheet much this next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think you asked the question about the future NIM prospects for the industry. And I think the banking
industry is pretty efficient. The good news is we already have a very conservative level of capital. So I think we're
well, as Paul said, well-positioned for those changes. But to the extent the capital rules do change or increase and
certainly that the cost of the average deposit in the industry, as all the big banks were saying, even the largest
banks are saying that's increasing as well, then you would expect, all else being equal, for spreads to expand
across the industry to preserve a reasonable NIM and a reasonable return on equity for the industry. And so to
the extent that we can be patient now and wait for more attractive opportunities at, at least, a more stable
environment, we think that'll serve our shareholders well over the long term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think if you really look at the industry over the last few years, certainly, deposits were extremely cheap and rates
are going up. But honestly, spreads weren't really what you'd expected historically given the types of loans folks
were making. So, it's natural in this kind of environment where people are being careful and the cost of funds are
higher, that I think spreads are going to expand. We believe that. So we can't say when, but we believe that'll
happen, and that's why we'll be a little more prudent in this next quarter or two with the balance sheet as we
watch what happens in the market.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
We've shown also in the other times whether we sold off COVID loans or other things during those periods. We've
found – we've shown we could expand the balance sheet pretty quickly. So, we're not worried about that. We're
just worried about making sure we do it in the right environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Understood. Just a quick follow-up and just a jumping off point there, as you think about, maybe Paul, should – if
you could just unpack, I think I understand it was between the sort the bank versus the third-party sweep impact,
but maybe unpack maybe where we are on a spot basis for the NIM. And as you think about this year, how do
you think about maybe earning asset levels? Because I hear a couple different things, cautious loan growth,
maybe some write-off to the corporate loan portfolio from sales, maybe some shrinkage on the investment
securities book. How do you think about maybe framing where the end of year might be in terms of your – you're
associated with that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hard to know where we're going to be. A lot can change as we learned in the last month or two, a lot can
change certainly in the next six months. And we're going to, as Paul said, we're going to be there for our clients in
the Private Client Group business. Half of our loans are securities-based loans and mortgages, and to the extent
demand picks back up over the next six months. Now they've been pressured in a rising rate environment. But
demand could come back if clients get used to the new normal in terms of rates and we want to be there to
support them.
As Paul said, we'll also be more conservative in sort of growing corporate loans, at least until we have a better
conviction around the risk-adjusted returns and growing that book. So in terms of the jumping off NIM, I would
expect just with the higher cash balances and the higher cost of funding, which again our patience have served us
well with the higher cost of funding as well. Because again, like I said, we only have 10% of our sweep and
Enhanced Yield Savings balances in the Enhanced Yield Savings Program.
Many of our competitors are at 40% or 50%. So we have a lot of ability to grow those balances. But as we grow
those balances, it would pressure NIM. So we think there's probably 20 basis points or so of pressure in the
upcoming quarter, maybe up to 30 basis points, again depending on what happens with the rate increases. And
now again that's due to the higher funding sources and elevated cash balances that we plan on holding on the
balance sheet.

Hey, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Can you take us through what happened with cash sorting in March and maybe since then? And I ask because
you noted in your press release last month that cash balances as of March 21st were near $51 billion. So it looks
like about $1.5 billion flowed out in last week, if you exclude the Enhanced Savings Program. So maybe take us
through what you were hearing from FAs and customers back then and what gives you the confidence that this
will slow from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say just jumping to kind of where we are today, for example, so we ended the quarter with sweep
balances and Enhanced Savings Program balances at $52.2 billion. You fast forward to where we are today and
we're right around $52 billion in sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances. And that reflects the fee billing
that we do quarterly, which was over $1.2 billion and also annual income tax payments.
So we feel comfortable and confident that the sorting dynamic is closer to the end than it has been to the
beginning. As I said on the comments, the average cash per account in the sweep program now is right around
$15,000, which is sort of a low point as far as we look back and have that data. So we're confident, but that things
are closer to the end, but we don't know how much longer obviously that dynamic will continue. Meanwhile, we'll
continue to be offer attractive products to our clients that give them good yields and give them good FDIC
coverage to keep deposit balances as strong as we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And I think you asked the FA reaction there, it's been, look, their job was to invest idle cash and they put it in
money markets and they didn't leave the system. They put it in money markets and they put it in treasuries and
CDs to get yields. And they said, just give us the yield. We like the program. So once we rolled it out, we've had
money flowing in. And so our job is to manage just how much of it we really need. It's in the system. We have a
very good product and we're just going to have to balance that given operations. We feel very comfortable at our
levels right now and with the reserves we have on top that we really haven't touched. So I think it's going to be
just a process of managing how much the higher cost of funds you need given the movement in the markets. So.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
One other metric that I think is pertinent on this topic is sort of deposit, aggregate deposit beta since rates started
rising, and really you have to look at it both at the sweep program and also adding the Enhanced Savings
Program balances. And on a spot basis, that aggregate deposit beta has only been for us 25% to 30%. And we
bet – which is lower than the competitors that we've seen so far. Again, they have a much higher mix of the higher
17


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
cost funding at this juncture, and that's with us being able to be more generous to our clients than most of our
competitors in the sweep program.
So to the extent that we have to raise some incremental higher cost deposits, 25% to 30% aggregate deposit beta
at this point is much lower than I think we all expected at this point in the cycle. So we have a lot of kind of
capacity and bandwidth to add higher cost funding while still generating attractive returns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That's helpful. And maybe as a related question then, can you talk about the puts and takes on the third-party
banks fee rate from here as we think over the next few quarters? So after the [indiscernible] (00:59:03) hiking
rates. I'm assuming that deposit betas will continue to rise and be a drag. But I guess at the same time, the
demand for these deposits will also likely be strong , is there some offset from the 12.5-basis-point or so of spread
that you make on that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
There's no doubt. I mean, there's huge demand for deposits in the system. So, the extent you have cash, banks
are hungry for it. So the question is, what happens with rate? And you would assume with that demand you might
get – the spreads should increase, right? So, yeah. So if the Fed stops raising it or you have a recessionary cash
returning out of the markets back into the regular sweep programs and deposit programs, you think you – our
prediction is you would – those spreads would increase, but we're not there at this point today.
So it's really hard looking forward right now. If we want to look forward a year or so, we feel a lot more
comfortable the next quarter just because we've been in the middle of since March of a very dynamic market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So it sounds like if balance is relatively flat in third-party banks, that you should also be relatively flat
beyond the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, if you look at the average, the average balances will be down 25% even if we keep them flat with
where they ended the quarter. So but beyond that then, it'll just depend on where the balance – the balances will
drive it more so than the spreads that we earned from the third party banks, I guess, is the easiest way to
describe it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, yeah, got it. Okay. And then just a quick clarification, on the office portfolio you mentioned in LTV of 60%.
How much of that is based on new appraisals versus valuation at the time the loan was made?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
It's a little bit of both, both on – to the extent that we have new appraisals that's factored into it. But, I mean, I think
you can assume, as I said in the prepared remarks, that valuations are probably lower now than even that new
appraisal date. So but the point being is we still have a reasonable cushion and underwrote those properties
conservatively. But we also expect there to be some challenges if the economy continues to soften particularly for
real estate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And in that percentage too, the extent you have REIT loans where even our experience in 2008 and 2009 was
that those diverse portfolios came through pretty well. And then when you have single property loans, you're more
idiosyncratic and so you just have to watch. But our total mix of commercial office is relatively low for any bank.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good evening. Just maybe circling back on Enhanced Savings Program, maybe a clarification, Paul. Are you
saying in March you had restrictions that required net new money and now those restrictions are off? And if that's
the case, how do you dial that back if you to? Is it just price? Or just want to make sure I understood what you're
saying on the Enhanced Savings product?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, the restrictions, we open it up for sales of certain securities for people that wanted to move from money
markets back into cash. But certainly recently in the money markets was the spread. So we've opened that up
and we have two choices. We can say – we we've given time limits. If we need more, we can extend the time
limits or if we want to cut it off, we can cut it off or you can always do that with rate and let it find – seek its own
level.
So we have all those options and we're just watching the balances. We're comfortable at these cash balances.
We're actually comfortable lower. But we're – Raymond James, we always seem to be accused of having excess
capital and excess balances. So we'll just dial it back or stop it or if we open it up to other securities type that you
really need it and there's treasuries, there's CDs, there's other things that have stayed on the system seeking
yield.
So we have a lot of flexibility, it just depends how much we need.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. So is this strategy from here, if and when we start to see sweet balances stabilize and it sounds like at least
the outflows are slowing a little bit in April, we'll see if that continues. But if that does stabilize, you sort of – is this
a level of deposits that you're comfortable with? You would sort of stop or slow the Enhanced Savings if you could
stabilize all in cash levels at the current levels – is this the defending level that you think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We think we're at a level even when we are at the end of the quarter, when you drop to below 50, we were
fine. But well we'll keep it so we have extra in this environment. We'd rather, if more flows in, we'll keep it for a
while. You can always again lower rate and have it flow out into other yielding instruments. But, yeah, we're not –
you're not trying to get it back into the 70s, that's for sure. We had excess – too much cash then but there was no
place to put it. But I think somewhere in the 50s level we'll try to – we would start slowing it down.

your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One, just it sounded like from Paul Shoukry's comments on the
comp ratio that if – unless we see some kind of substantial change in capital markets environment that the comp
ratio is probably – this is probably a reasonable zone to think about until that inflect. Number one, is that right?
And then if we do see a recovery in the capital markets revenue, what kind of order of magnitude would you
expect to feed through and pull down that comp ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's a mix – it's always complicated because it – revenue mix matters when you talk about our comp
ratio. So we expect PCG revenues to be up given the higher fees, assets and fee-based accounts, but that has a
higher compensation ratio associated with it than our net NII does, obviously. And so but, again, to the extent
capital markets revenues rebound to healthier levels, not even record levels, but that they were enjoying in the
last couple of years, but just healthy levels, then that would result, all else being equal, in an improvement to the
comp ratio.
So again, it's just hard given the revenue mix. I think 63% roughly for us historically has been very low, and that's
been helped by the high levels of interest income and BDP fees that are not directly compensable to the
producers. But I think the revenue mix going forward will dictate what the result will be, I think, anywhere close to
63%. Again, our guidance was 66% or lower just a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago. And that would have
been historically a pretty attractive place to be. I'm not saying that's where we're going to get to, but if we can stay
anywhere close to this range, we'd be pleased with that.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Brennan Hawken Q

Got it. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense with the 10% decline in RJBDP. So one more on cash and deposit
dynamics. I'm sorry, it's been a real dead horse to beat here, but you gave the trends quarter-to-date in the
Enhanced program, which is really helpful. Could you also speak to like overall trends in cash quarter-to-date?
And then if what we're seeing in the Enhanced program would be selling out of the purchase money fund and into
the deposit program, wouldn't then we see you moving in the direction of the peers. Paul Shoukry, I think you
commented a few times on how you're at 10% and peers are at 50%. Does that mean you're going to converge to
that level or would you be pulling on some of those price and other levers that you referenced before to prevent
that from happening? Thanks.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, yeah, the number one thing is the banking business, I think maybe people forgot over the last decade,
liquidity in protecting stable deposits. So that's number one. So that's, it really depends on the deposit level. And
to the extent, we've given kind of a general target to you on the deposit levels, you just – you have to compete
with rates and to grow them unless market conditions change. And we don't know when that will happen. So
yeah, if the market keeps doing that, my guess is ours will go up over 10 and theirs will go up over 50 because
the good – this deposits reprice and you're repricing more, that's going to be a trend for everybody. It'll be
industrywide. If it's idiosyncratic, for one institution for some reason that they need a lot more, it's going to go
higher. So a lot of that's market dynamics.
I think the biggest thing people forget when we limited kind of the money we put into banks for many years at 50%
and then when TriState joined, we opted, we have less leverage, about 70% of our deposits go roughly to our
banks. We have competitors at 90%. And if you're up, and it's not a criticism there, but if you're at 90%, you got to
be more aggressive for funding. We have more of a buffer. So we'll just watch it, and play it by year and watch it
closely and do what we have to do to make sure we maintain our liquidity. And the outcome will be how much of
higher cost deposits we have to have. But we're not doing it just to raise costs. We're only going to just do that if
we need it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And the only other thing I'll add to that is we have over $40 billion of purchased money market funds, our clients
have over $40 billion of purchased money market funds on the platform. So all the cash really stayed within the
system. To the extent that – and we are very little on those purchase money market funds as a firm. So to the
extent that our clients prefer to have the FDIC insurance at the attractive rates that we would be willing to offer
that we are offering today, then it could really be a win-win for the client and for the firm because now that cash,
even though it's higher cost of funding relative to our sweeps can give us – generate more economics than it's
staying in the purchase money market fund. So you kind of have to look at the holistic picture to determine
whether or not it's really a win-win. And as Paul said earlier, we always strive to look for those win-win
opportunities for both clients, advisors and the firm.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And part of the comfort we've had is just our nature. When you look at Raymond James Bank history, they have
95% of the deposits insured, we went way out of our way and paid money in programs to make sure they were
insured. Just as a matter of course, we weren't worried about we weren't worried about uninsured deposits of two

years ago the deposits were flush, but typical for us. We just looked down range and say, okay, for the premium,
it's worth it to have for clients to be protected. And then I think it keeps our funding sources more stable.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. And also for the added points on your philosophy. Could you touch on
the point about overall cash trends quarter-to-date beyond just Enhanced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, as I said, we are today right around where we ended the quarter. We're right around $52 billion of sweep
and Enhanced Savings Program balances. I think the Enhanced Savings Program balances are over $4.5 billion.
And again, to be flat in the month of April with the tax payments and the quarterly fee billing, we think is a good
result and hopefully portends well for the dynamic going forward.

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you, all, for joining us as I know you're all busy given all the dynamics in the market. So obviously,
uncertain market. But again I think the conservative way we've run the firm really puts us in good shape. We are
at our conference with 4,000 advisors here and they're pretty excited. So it's nice to be here. Thanks for joining us
and we'll talk to you all soon.
