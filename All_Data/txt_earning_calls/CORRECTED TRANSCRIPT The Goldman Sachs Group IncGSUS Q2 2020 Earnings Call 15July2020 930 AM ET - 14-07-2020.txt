Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Heather; and thank you, everyone, for joining this call this morning. I would like to start by saying that all
of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends, and your family remain safe and healthy during this
unprecedented global health crisis.
Let me begin on page 1 of the presentation to review our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net
revenues of $13.3 billion, up 41% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise was evident
this quarter as we delivered solid net earnings of $2.4 billion, earnings per share of $6.26, and a return on equity
of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.8%.
Our results in the quarter were strong, even while incurring higher credit provisions and litigation expenses, both
of which impacted our returns. Our second quarter results contributed to solid first-half 2020 revenues of $22
billion, net earnings of $3.6 billion, and an ROE of 8.4% and ROTE of 9%. Litigation costs burdened our first-half
returns by approximately 280 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses.
The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and was driven by significant new issue
volumes and the countercyclical performance of our market-making activities. We maintained our leading position

as the strategic advisor of choice for our Investment Banking clients with our strong league table positions across
underwriting markets, with extraordinary volumes in both debt and equity, enabling us to pick up market share.
We delivered exceptional performance in FICC and Equities on high levels of client activity, deploying our risk
intermediation expertise and our balance sheet on behalf of clients in a volatile market. We continued to provide
high-quality advice to our wealth management clients and generated another quarter of solid consumer deposit
growth.
In Asset Management, we recognized gains from market appreciation in our public investments, continued to
harvest private equity positions and experienced a partial recovery in our credit portfolio from the first quarter.
Importantly, we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet, with an improving capital position amid high
levels of market volatility and economic stress.
Turning to the operating environment on page 2, we are navigating an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop
brought on by an extraordinary global health crisis. During the second quarter, we experienced both positive and
negative forces, reflecting the near-term economic challenges related to recent business shutdowns,
counterbalanced by continued support from central banks and governments and market optimism as certain
economies began to reopen. However, as we speak today, the path to reopening in many US states and
corresponding economic consequences remain unclear.
Since our April earnings call, our economists' estimates for 2020 US GDP improved from an expected contraction
in 2020 of 6.2% to 4.6% today, driven by expectations of a faster rebound from a deeper trough. That said, on a
global basis, growth expectations for 2020 deteriorated from an expected 2.5% decline in April to a 3.4%
contraction expected today, with the second quarter, reflecting a deeper decline in activity than expected three
months ago. The prospect for a steeper recovery in the second half is in no small part due to the forceful and
rapid action by global central banks and governments, which are providing exceptional levels of liquidity and
ongoing fiscal stimulus. These actions have been key to market resilience, tempering the economic impact of the
virus.
In the United States, we are seeing early indications of economic improvement, including the better than expected
18% rebound in retail sales and notable improvement in unemployment in June to approximately 11% from more
elevated numbers in May. As markets assess the impact of the virus in the second quarter and its potential
economic consequence, we experienced a rise in the valuation of risk assets.
During the second quarter, the S&P 500 rallied by 20%, marking its best quarter since 1998; while broader global
equity markets rose a similar amount. Investment-grade spreads tightened by over 80 basis points and high-yield
spreads tightened by roughly 140 basis points this quarter. In the context of these moves in financial assets,
strong levels of client engagement during the second quarter demonstrate the breadth and the strength of our
franchise.
As we go forward as risk managers, we continue to prepare for the prolonged economic challenges and look
beyond market valuations and our overall assessment of risk. We maintain a strong financial profile and remain
agile with our balance sheet as we continue to serve our clients. Pivoting for a moment, I am pleased to note that
volatility in the first half of 2020 did not hinder our progress on most of our key growth initiatives.
On June 16, we officially launched our transaction banking service to US clients on time and below budget
despite the unexpected challenges of shifting our global team to work-from-home and launching the platform

remotely. As of quarter end, we have over 175 clients on the platform and $25 billion in deposits, many of which,
we expect will become operational as clients begin their utilization of the platform over time.
Second, in Alternatives, we accelerated the marketing of a new credit fund called, West Street Strategic Solutions
as a part of our transition to fund-driven investing. Client receptivity has been very strong. We believe this strategy
is well-timed to capture opportunities in the market today and provide critical private financing to companies in
need. Our approach is highly differentiated, leveraging the broad global sourcing capabilities of Goldman Sachs.
Just this week we have closed on over $6 billion of commitments. Ultimately, we expect to raise in excess of $10
billion in the coming months. What is most impressive is that our first close occurred in less than 90 days entirely
via virtual meetings.
We are broadening our client base to include leading institutions and pension fund investors that have not
partnered with Goldman Sachs before. These expanding relationships will be helpful to our efforts as additional
strategies and funds are launched. You will recall that this initiative was part of our strategy discussed at Investor
Day in January and promises to be significant in our move toward a less capital-intensive, more fee-driven model
for our investing platforms.
Third, in Wealth Management, we continue to integrate our new high net worth business, which we recently
rebranded, Personal Financial Management. Year-to-date we have generated over 400 client referrals between
Personal Financial Management and our flagship ultra-high net worth Private Wealth business, representing $1.5
billion in assets under supervision opportunity, as we now have a credible offering to serve high net worth clients.
That said, establishing new Wealth Management relationships in the current environment with only virtual
communications is challenging. We would expect our progress to accelerate under more normal circumstances.
Fourth, we continue to expand our digital consumer business. We were pleased to announce our new small
business lending partnership with Amazon, which will allow us to leverage our proprietary digital underwriting
decision platform using data shared by Amazon's third-party sellers to provide inventory and operational financing
to support their growth. This partnership, which is being launched on a smaller scale at this moment, is another
example of our innovation and our ability to partner with leading corporations to deliver differentiated value to our
customers. Our consumer partnerships also included our recent point-of-sale financing engagement with JetBlue,
and of course, our credit card with Apple.
Before turning to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on diversity and inclusion, which is a critical priority for
the firm and a personal focus of mine for many years. Like so many others over the past six weeks, I've spent a
lot of time listening and learning about the challenges we face as a nation on racial equity. While Goldman Sachs
has long sought to advance diversity and inclusion, we're still not where we need to be. It is both a moral and
economic imperative that we make progress. We must be a diverse and inclusive organization to unlock our full
potential as we serve a global marketplace that is diverse in all aspects including race, ethnicity, gender and
sexual orientation.
Lastly, let me review our business resiliency and return-to-office strategy which has begun in our major offices
globally. The firm continues to seamlessly serve our clients while the vast majority of our employees work
remotely, demonstrating the dedication of our people, the strength of our technology and our business resiliency.
Our firm has always had a team-oriented apprenticeship culture, and we benefit from being and working together.
So, as each of the communities where we operate reopens, we are taking the necessary steps to gradually return
to office in a safe manner.

We are following the lead of our Asia colleagues, wherein Hong Kong's using a split-team approach with up to
50% working from the office. We're also making progress in Europe, where on the continent, 35% returned; and in
the UK, where approximately 15% of our employees are back in office. Recently in New York, a small group of
employees have returned to office. Going forward, our progress will be dictated by circumstances in each region,
and we will adjust as needed.
We are taking many new precautions to ensure safety including through masks and social distancing. And it's
certainly not business as usual, but we're making tangible forward progress. As we take these steps, we will
continue to keep the health and safety of our people as our top priority.
In closing, I would just like to say how proud I am of the people of Goldman Sachs. They have worked tirelessly
during this time to engage and serve our clients, leverage technology to ensure our resiliency and prudently
manage our risk and financial resources.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen.

Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David; and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on page 3. During the second
quarter, we saw very strong performance from our Investment Banking and Global Markets segments, as clients
were exceptionally active in raising capital in the equity and debt markets, managing balance sheets,
repositioning investment portfolios, and hedging risks across asset classes.
We also saw year-over-year revenue growth in our Consumer & Wealth Management segment as we continued
to expand our Private Wealth, High Net Worth, and Consumer businesses. Gains across these three segments
were partly offset by a decline in our Asset Management segment, given smaller gains on equity investments
versus a year ago.
Before turning to segment results, I want to spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal
Reserve stress test results. On June 29, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative Stress Capital Buffer
estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.7%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.7% for the firm
effective October 1.
While higher than anticipated, this requirement is just slightly higher than our reported standardized CET1 ratio of
13.6% as of June 30. In fact, our current CET1 ratio improved by 110 basis points this quarter and is now 30
basis points higher than where we started this year, demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our capital,
while deploying balance sheet for our clients.
Consistent with the Federal Reserve's requirements for all large banks, we'll extend the suspension of share
repurchases into the third quarter. But it is our intention to maintain our dividends, both common and preferred
while complying with the SCB rule upon implementation. Furthermore, we will continue to pursue our long-
standing practice of deploying capital to our business where returns are accretive, and otherwise returning it to
our shareholders as permissible and ever mindful of the environment.
As we consider the results of the stress test, it is important to bear in mind that the firm, like the industry,
experienced an actual stress test over the past few months. The global economy contracted sharply, and
unemployment in the US hit levels higher than contemplated in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario.
During this period, we maintained robust levels of liquidity and capital. And despite the stress, the firm emerged

from the second quarter stronger and continues to serve clients from a position of financial and competitive
strength and with the objective of producing attractive returns for our shareholders.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at
Investor Day is appropriate for our firm on a medium-term basis, but we recognize our near-term capital
requirement is higher in light of the stress test results. We do not control the Federal Reserve's scenarios and
models, but the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing the strategy outlined at Investor Day,
with a focus on diversifying our business mix and reducing the stress capital intensity of our balance sheet.
As David highlighted, our execution of this strategy is advancing. We have sold or announced the sale of nearly
$4 billion in equity investments year-to-date, including our agreed sale of Global Atlantic just last week, which will
have positive implications for capital and balance sheet. We remain committed to capital efficiency as we diversify
our business and grow more durable revenues.
With that, let's now turn to our business performance on page 4, beginning with Investment Banking. Investment
Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $2.7 billion, up 36% versus a year-ago. Financial Advisory
revenues of $686 million remain healthy, but down 11% versus last year amid fewer transaction closings
consistent with the industry. Year-to-date, we participated in nearly $290 billion of announced transactions and
closed over 140 deals for $600 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced
and completed M&A league table rankings by a considerable margin.
While recent M&A announcements have slowed, our Investment Banking client dialogues remained very active,
with client interactions up over 30% versus last year, notwithstanding the continuing work-from-home dynamic. In
the second half, we are watching for a potential pickup in M&A activity, both from companies coming from a
position of strength, as well as those challenged by the environment. Dislocated asset prices will help drive those
opportunities, as will the significant amount of private capital available for deployment. That said, macro and
political uncertainty remain relevant and will influence outcomes.
As M&A announcements declined in the quarter, the headline for Investment Banking was in Underwriting. In
these turbulent markets, we have seen our Underwriting market shares increase as clients have turned to
Goldman Sachs, particularly for more complex and innovative financings, where execution matters. In Equity
underwriting, we delivered record quarterly net revenues of $1.1 billion. Year-to-date, we ranked number one
globally in equity underwriting as our volumes jumped to over $50 billion across more than 270 deals. We saw
strong activity this quarter across IPOs, follow-ons and private issuances. Convertibles also had record activity,
where we ranked number one.
In Debt underwriting, net revenues were $990 million, up 93% from a year ago, as we helped finance record US
investment-grade volumes and supported a broader reopening of the high-yield market. Since the crisis hit, our
market shares in investment-grade and high-yield have increased globally, driving our number four ranking in
global debt underwriting. This performance, amidst the volatility of the last several months, is the product of many
years of strategic focus and investment in our client franchise.
Given the pace of activity, our Investment Banking backlog decreased significantly versus the first quarter. This is
a function of both the volume of our recent deal execution and slower replenishment. It is also important to point
out that the timeline from discussion to execution, notably in financing, has shortened in this period, and therefore
backlog may, for the moment, be an incomplete indicator of forward activity.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Revenues from Corporate lending were negative $76 million, reflecting $200 million of hedge losses. For risk
management purposes, we maintain single-name hedges on certain larger relationship lending commitments. As
credit spreads tightened during the quarter, we reversed much of the $375 million hedge gain we saw last quarter.
With respect to relationship lending, we also saw a meaningful reversal of corporate commitment draws in the
quarter, totaling $9 billion in net pay-downs as financing conditions improved, and we helped clients access the
capital markets. The strong issuance market also enabled us to reduce our Underwriting commitments in the
deals book. For example, we successfully syndicated acquisition financings, including €10 billion for thyssenkrupp
and $27 billion for T-Mobile, thereby reducing exposure to the firm.
Moving to Global Markets on page 5, where we experienced considerable strength in performance. Net revenues
were $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity,
continued wider bid-ask spreads and strong risk management amid continued market volatility. The business
benefited from expanded market share as investment in the client franchise and our continued strategic
commitment to a global business model with scale across asset classes bolstered performance.
Turning to FICC on page 6. Net revenues were $4.2 billion. Growth versus last year was driven by a 163%
increase in intermediation and 71% increase in financing revenues. In FICC intermediation, we saw elevated
client flows, with all five of our businesses increasing versus last year. In credit, our performance benefited from
broad-based client engagement and strength across investment-grade, high-yield, and distressed, as well as
bank loans amid wider bid-ask margins, tighter credit spreads and high new issue volume. We also saw continued
success in systematic and electronic market-making, including high utilization rates for our bond pricing engine
and automated trading, all leading to higher market share for the business.
In currencies, we had another very active quarter with solid activity among corporates, banks and hedge fund
clients. Revenues improved as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume in the Americas and
Europe. Our rates franchise also performed well on strong trading and high-levels of client activity, as elevated
volatility normalized amid coordinated global central bank stimulus. In commodities, strong trading performance
was aided by high volumes and volatility across all of our businesses, including oil, natural gas and metals. In
mortgages, net revenues improved significantly on strength in agency and non-agency trading, partly offset by
lower loan trading volumes. Lastly, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength across repo and structured
credit.
Turning to Equities. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2.9 billion, up 46% versus a year-ago. Equities
intermediation net revenues of $2.2 billion rose 91%, aided by robust performance in cash and derivatives amid
elevated client volumes. We saw strength across the board in commissions, market-making, electronic trading,
and ETFs as we executed for a broad base of active, passive, hedge fund, and systematic clients. This reflects
our multiyear efforts to leverage our scale and expand wallet share. Equity financing revenues of $742 million
declined 14% year-over-year, driven by tighter spreads, lower average client balances and weakness in Europe,
given recent dividend cancellations.
Finally, across Global Markets, we continued to invest in technology platforms to enhance user experience and
straight-through processing. We also saw continued high levels of client activity on our Marquee platform through
the second quarter with our highest-ever external engagement in April.
Moving to Asset Management now on page 7. In the second quarter, we generated segment revenues of $2.1
billion, down 18% versus a year ago. As a reminder, this segment includes our platform that serves clients across
a full spectrum of asset classes, from liquidity to alternatives, as well as our own on-balance-sheet investing

activities. As David mentioned, we expect third-party investing in this segment to grow over time as part of our
broader strategic initiatives.
Management and other fees related to Asset Management clients totaled $684 million, up 3% versus a year-ago,
driven by higher assets under supervision, offset by mix, given growth in liquidity products. Equity investments
produced $924 million of net gains in the second quarter, aided by asset sales and a significant rebound in the
value of public equity positions.
More specifically, on our $2.6 billion public equity portfolio, we recognized $635 million of gains, including
approximately $200 million in gains on Avantor and Sprout, and significantly better performance across the
broader portfolio. Despite recent gains, we reduced the size of our public portfolio by roughly 35% over the past
five years.
On our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated event-driven gains of approximately $500 million from
various positions, including the sale of our UK student housing investment and AirTrunk, an Australian data
center, both of which we announced last quarter. These gains were offset by $415 million of negative marks
relating to certain COVID-impacted and other investments. This quarter, approximately 20% of companies in our
private equity portfolio saw their performance impacted by COVID-19. Lastly, we also had positive revenues of
$200 million related to our consolidated investment entities in the private equity portfolio.
Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $459 million, which
include approximately $200 million from net interest income, with the remainder from gains on fair-valued debt
securities and loans, reflecting tighter credit spreads, retracing nearly 25% of the losses taken last quarter.
Let me now turn to page 8, where we provide further transparency on the composition and diversification of our
Asset Management balance sheet. On the left of this slide, we show our equity investment portfolio broken out by
sector, geography, and vintage. We also provide new detail on our $20 billion portfolio of CIEs. These are
primarily comprised of real estate investments, of which $11 billion are financed predominantly by nonrecourse
debt. At the bottom of the slide, we show the diversification of the portfolio, with only 7% related to the retail sector
and 4% to hospitality.
On the right side of the slide, we reflect our $30 billion lending and debt investment portfolio, which includes $17
billion of loans that are predominantly secured and $13 billion of debt investments. We further break down these
amounts by accounting classification, sector and geography. This portfolio comprises corporate and real estate
loans and corporate debt securities. We will continue to refine this disclosure to be responsive to questions from
the investor community.
I'll now turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on page 9. In this segment, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues
in the second quarter, up 9% versus a year ago, driven by higher Wealth Management assets and higher
Consumer banking revenues. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $938 million rose 13%
versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision rose 14%
versus the prior year to $558 billion.
Consumer banking revenues were $258 million in the second quarter, rising 19% versus last year, reflecting
higher net interest income from credit card lending. Consumer deposits at quarter-end totaled $92 billion across
the US and UK, reflecting $20 billion of growth in the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at
roughly $7 billion, of which approximately $5 billion were from Marcus loans and $2 billion from Apple Card. We
continue to prudently risk-manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Now, let's turn to page 10 for our firmwide assets under supervision. Total client assets increased to $2.1 trillion,
up approximately $240 billion versus the first quarter and up nearly $400 billion versus a year ago. This marks the
first quarter in which we exceeded $2 trillion in assets under supervision. Our sequential improvement was driven
by $100 billion of market appreciation, $133 billion of liquidity inflows and $6 billion of long-term inflows.
On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firmwide net
interest income was $944 million for the second quarter, down sequentially and versus a year ago, amid lower
rates and an increase in our liquidity pool. Importantly, and as I have noted previously, as a firm, our overall
results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. While our balance sheet is modestly
asset-sensitive, given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and hedge floating rate liabilities, if interest
rates remain stable, we expect NII to gradually expand over time as our consumer deposits reprice.
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was
$117 billion, down $11 billion sequentially, as we saw significant paydowns on corporate revolvers, as I noted
earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, up $650 million versus last quarter.
Let me break this provision number down for you. On the wholesale portfolio, we took pool reserves of $700
million, as modeled losses under CECL were higher relative to the first quarter, principally as a function of
macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP worsening in the second quarter relative to similar
inputs during the first quarter. The $700 million included both higher loss expectations and lower recovery rates.
We also took impairments on wholesale loans of $540 million, primarily related to credits in the industrials, TMT
and natural resource sectors. Included in the $540 million of impairments was $155 million related to Hertz, as the
company declared bankruptcy. This impairment was the largest in the quarter and was offset by gains on hedges,
which served as a risk-mitigant, with hedge gains reported in the Lending subsegment of Investment Banking.
In our Consumer portfolio, provisions of $305 million increased versus last quarter, reflecting $220 million of
reserve build and $85 million of net charge-offs. During the quarter, we recognized firmwide net charge-offs of
$260 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 0.9%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter. At
quarter-end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9
billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans increased 120 basis points to 3.7% for our $105 billion
accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 17%.
Next, let's turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $8.4 billion increased versus
last year. This includes higher compensation expense in line with revenue growth. Our non-comp expense growth
was driven by $120 million increase in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees from higher client activity; $130
million of investments related to technology and new businesses, including Apple Card and PFM; and $100
million in CIE expense, which should decline as we harvest these investments; and a roughly $900 million
increase in litigation.
Our reported year-to-date efficiency ratio was 67%, which was burdened by over 5 percentage points due to
litigation. We continue to make progress on our medium-term expense savings initiatives as set forth at Investor
Day and expect to realize additional planned reductions in non-compensation expenses through the back half of
the year. Finally, our reported tax rate was 22% for the year-to-date, reflecting impact of higher earnings on
permanent tax benefits and nondeductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next
few years to be approximately 21%.

Turning to our capital levels on slide 13. As I mentioned, Common Tier 1 Equity ratio for the firm was 13.6% at the
end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, up 110 basis points sequentially, more than
recouping the decline seen in the first quarter. The improvement was driven largely by earnings and RWA
management. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 10 basis points to 12.4%, as higher capital was
partially offset by higher RWAs due to a full quarter impact of increased market volatility.
On the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, up 5% versus last quarter. We maintained
strong liquidity levels, with our global core liquid assets averaging a record $290 billion, with growth largely
commensurate with balance sheet expansion amid strong deposit growth. On the liability side, our total deposits
increased to $268 billion, up $48 billion versus last quarter, which should enable us to maintain low levels of
wholesale financing activity for the balance of the year, as had been our intention.
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise and our
ability to provide differentiated advice and market access in a volatile environment. We maintain a prudent risk
orientation, mindful of continued uncertainty in the markets and the ongoing health crisis. Our core businesses are
performing well, and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan. We remain confident in our
financial position, capital base and liquidity, which set the foundation for our ability to serve our clients through this
challenging time.
With that, thank you again for dialing in. And we'll now open up the line for questions.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So, my question on trading is towards the beginning of the year, say, at Investor Day, we
were talking about a little more focus on the financing side and felt like clients would pay for that. And
intermediation has been more commoditized, and volatility was low. And so, what do you know, intermediation
spikes because the world goes crazy.
So, I'm curious of two things on this front. One is, is the pickup in intermediation just a function of volatility, and
that'll subside as the world calms down? Has anything changed there in terms of pricing, market share and the
client needs for you? That's part A.
And part B is, on the financing front, you did show progress. It is growing, but is there anything in the way the
CCAR stress testing goes that would frown upon that, or would change your intention on continuing to grow the
financing side?

Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for the question. It's David. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start at a high level on
trading activity. And I think Stephen will answer the second point around financing and addressing your question
as to potential impacts of CCAR.

There's no question that when we step back and we think strategically about our franchise, we want to be in a
position to serve our clients. We've always had great confidence in the broad global footprint that we bring to
Global Markets, that we're in all products all over the world. And as our clients look to intermediate markets, we
have a full service capability to serve them.
There's no question that over the last decade, in a period of very low interest rates and low volatility, that has
been a more commoditized service. As you say, in a period, where there's enormous change and enormous
volatility in markets, we became super busy because our clients were super busy. And the reason you see this
pickup in activity is because there was a lot of activity from our clients.
I don't necessarily view that as permanent. But at the same point, it shows you that, whether it's in a more low,
muted environment where we're well positioned to grow our financing business to serve our clients' needs, or in a
period where our clients need more access to liquidity, our franchise is very well-positioned to serve them. And I
think we've got a benefit in this quarter from that positioning.
It's obviously very hard to predict, given the uncertain nature of the environment, how this would continue. I'd say
upfront, because I know it'll be a question from a number of you, that the activity levels that we saw at the end of
March and in April were really extraordinary. We've not seen the same level of activity over the course of the last
five or six weeks, since the beginning of June. But I would say, the activity levels over the last five or six weeks,
when looked at compared to activity levels in 2019 or 2018, still look pretty active. And so, we continue to see
clients very, very engaged in our Markets business.
I think Stephen should comment on financing, CCAR, and how we're thinking about that. So, I'll pass to Stephen.

Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, David; and thanks, Glenn, for the question. Just to sort of pivot off of David's comments, I would say, the
important thing to think about in the context of activity is that we were experiencing, as David put it, very elevated
volumes at wider bid-offer. And Goldman Sachs should have went to the market and didn't pull back and away
from the market. And in doing that, we've picked up market share, which I think will have lasting effect,
notwithstanding where the market goes in terms of its dynamic.
And the other thing I would point out is that in working through those flows, we managed risk really well, meaning,
we were not with elevated inventory. We saw high-velocity turn in our risk in serving the intermediation needs of
the clients. And I think that's an important point to make.
On the financing side of the business overall, it's important to bear in mind, financing in FICC was up about 71%.
We saw considerable strength both in repo and in structured credit. We saw similar activity on the equity financing
side as well.
As it relates to SCB and CCAR, I think that the ability of the firm to be agile and take our capital ratio up to 13.6%
kind of takes SCB off the table and capital off the table in terms of our ability to present ourselves into the third
quarter and beyond, as ready and open to play the role we did in the second quarter, which is stand ready to
meet the intermediation and trading needs of our clients.
And I think the final comment I'd make, just on capital is that, we said during Investor Day that we would be agile,
meaning we would be agile with the deployment of capital in and around the businesses of the firm. Now, at the
12

time, the questions that came to us were more about the ability to pull capital from the Securities business, not put
to it. In this quarter, we moved capital to it. Returns were extraordinary, super attractive, and we were able to
move that around as the kind of flexible organization that we like to think of ourselves as. And we'll continue to do
that based on what the market opportunity shows us.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Very helpful. And thank you for all that. One other question is, you mentioned the sale of Global Atlantic. I think
that closes in a few quarters. I think you guys should get a lot of respect for growing that from scratch, basically.
Just curious on how much of that – what percent did you own – Goldman Sachs own, not the private client –
Goldman Sachs own? Sizing of the gain, how much RWA that frees up, and anything you could help on that?
Considering it's a good business, it's just really dense RWA, I guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
No. I mean, Glenn, I think you characterized it exactly well, and you hit the point, which was our motivation for the
sale itself, which is this was a business that began in 2004. It was spun off in the second quarter of 2013. And
over time, because of its intensity as a financial institution, it becomes more capital-intensive. So, obviously, our
motivation is to free up that capital and deploy it elsewhere around.
We were about 25% of the ownership. We're selling out, if not all, then the preponderance of our position. On that
sale, we'll release about $2.2 billion of risk-weighted assets and about $400 million of attributed equity. I'd also
point out that this is part and parcel of kind of a larger move that will take place over the course of the entire year,
which is, this will be part of about $4 billion of sales off the balance sheet, all part of our broader strategy of
looking at lower capital intensity, lower balance-sheet-intense investments and moving more towards third-party
funds.
And so, we will, by the end of the year, reduce that down by about $4 billion. That will relieve us of about $2 billion
of capital and about $13 billion of risk-weighted assets, again Global Atlantic being part of that. I would say,
roughly speaking, almost half of that is done, with the other half announced and spoken for and expected through
the balance of the year.

Maybe just following up on the capital question just asked. I guess, if I think about your CET1 potential for another
50 basis points of G-SIB surcharge, maybe you might want some management buffer on top of what would be a
minimum SCB number.
Your actual capital requirements could be approaching 15% on the standardized side. So, maybe just help us
think about how you think about getting that number back down to more like 13%, 13.5%, which is your long-term
target. And then, sort of what are the implications for sort of your strategic growth initiatives to the extent you have
to bring down capital by that much?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Christian. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we remain committed over the medium term to the
range of 13% to 13.5%. I think we're executing at the moment in the moment, meaning we're in the midst of a
pandemic. Obviously, the results around CCAR and the SCB fixing was higher than what we had expected and
perhaps reflects a view about where we are at a moment in the market. But I think our strategy, as articulated at
Investor Day, and frankly speaking what I described in the path toward reducing down capital intensity of our
balance sheet investing, are all part and parcel of our ability to take down what is otherwise meant to be
represented in the peak to trough in the SCB.
And so, we're executing now. We are in a position, having grown back our capital ratio to be within narrow
distance of what's required. But, again, that's a moment. I wouldn't fix a permanent capital buffer, nor look to
amend what I view as our medium to long-term objective for a profile of the business which will benefit from key
strategic initiatives, which will lower the capital intensity of where we're going. And I think that's the forward path.
And so, we'll remain quick on our feet as it relates to this, but I just want to give you a sense of what the forward
direction is for the firm itself.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Great. Thank you. And then on cost, very strong core cost control ex litigation in the quarter. I believe you
mentioned you'd expect more non-comp benefit in the back half, so maybe help quantify that for us? And then,
maybe longer-term, you've had a bit of a chance now to get a sense of the post-COVID world, and so how do you
think about sort of structural expense trajectory, particularly in light of that sort of $1.3 billion target? How much
upside could there be in that number? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So in non-comp expenses, as you suggest, ex litigation, our non-comp expenses are up about 9%. And a
good portion of that increase is attributable to variable expense, like BC&E. So, this is expense obviously related
to the nature and level of activity that we experience in the business. And the other portion of that increase is
largely related to new businesses or larger-sized businesses than where we were a year ago. So, think, the
14


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(GS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
acquisition of United Capital, expenses associated with it or Apple Card. And so, expense control has been on the
front of our mind.
What I expect to play out in the back half of the year will be, as we've said previously, the benefits from a
reduction in double occupancy expense relating to real estate, two buildings both in London and in Bangalore that
roll off. And so, as we've long planned and expected, that will benefit us in terms of the reduction in non-comp
expense overall.
On a more structural plane, and thinking back to the $1.3 billion of expense reduction that we articulated, frankly, I
think we come at that number now with greater confidence in that number, and frankly, the ability to exceed it over
the medium to long term. And part of that is informed by judgments that we are making and analysis that we're
undergoing, not just simply about the size of the firm, but where the physical location of the firm can be. That is
our ability to take aggregation of people or whole businesses and look to move them to different locations either
around the world or around the country. And I think the flexibility and the agility that we can take from what we've
witnessed in the context of the last several months only feeds our confidence and the ability to do that, and
therefore, ability to hit the $1.3 billion target or better over time.

Wanted to ask just a follow-up on the funding optimization efforts that you guys have talked about before. And
certainly, the deposit growth continues to surprise positively, both on the consumer side, as well as within
transaction banking. Given that some of the growth appears to be tracking ahead of plan, it sounds like you're
quite confident on your expense savings targets from Investor Day. I was hoping you could give us an update on
the funding side as well, whether you are still quite confident in that $1 billion savings goal, recognizing that a lot
of it's going to be dependent on term structure, shape of the curve, what have you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So on deposits, your observation is right. I mean, total deposits for the firm now is $268 billion. That's up
$48 billion quarter-on-quarter. Marcus deposits now, again, through the retail channel are at $92 billion. That was
up $20 billion in the second quarter. And we're also seeing deposits come in, though not yet operational in the
transaction banking deposit side. So, the growth in the deposit channels overall has been really, really positive.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
The question of whether we can harvest the precise level of savings of $1 billion that we forecast rests largely on
market sort of developments. What I mean by that is the deposits in retail currently are, from a financial point of
view, less valuable in the moment than where they were in the January Investor Day, meaning, we've seen Fed
Funds come down by about 150 basis points, but we haven't experienced corresponding beta on the downside in
the retail deposit channel. That will come over time as we develop a more sort of substantive and profound level
of engagement with retail customers. The reliance on rate will become less so, and we'll be able to sort of capture
back where we were.
But I'd say that much of what we premised our Investor Day presentation on was an assumption about normal
markets. We're not in normal markets. The precipitous decline in rates, but not a corresponding decline in
deposits, will lessen some of the savings. But I wouldn't sort of put too much of a permanent conclusion to that.
Let's wait until we get to a more permanent state of a normal market to sort of judge that. By the way, by contrast,
we do see positive beta in other channels, which play that way, particularly in the High Net Worth channel, but I
think we'll need to sort of assess just the magnitude.
By the way, none of that is to take away from the strategic value of this consumer and the overall deposit channel,
which is enabling us, frankly, faster than we thought, to take out the wholesale funding channel. And just by way
of reference, we've got about $10 billion of wholesale debt through the balance of this year, either maturing or
subject to call. And we'll be able to sort of act on that, reducing down the liquidity that we hold, all as a
consequence of the growth that we've seen in the deposit channel overall.

Maybe just a question for you, David, on the M&A outlook. And one of the concerns we've heard from folks is the
challenging M&A backdrop could very well persist, just given low levels of CEO confidence and just uncertainty
around the election and future tax policy. I was hoping you could give some color as to what you're hearing from
the C-suite regarding appetite for M&A and willingness to do deals? And maybe what ingredients need to be in
place to help reinvigorate deal activity here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks for that question. And of course, you're right at a high level. And we've always said this, the number one
thing that drives M&A activity is CEO confidence. And there's no question, in this environment, given the high
level of uncertainty, it's much harder to see those same levels of confidence.
As a result of that, as we highlighted in our opening commentary, M&A volume – announced M&A transactions in
the second quarter were down 75%. And so, as you would expect, we saw a withdrawal of activity. We obviously
16


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(GS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
saw closings on previous activity, but we did not see replenishment in advisory transactions that we would
normally see.
And I'd say that in March and April, in particular, and into the first half of May, dialogue with CEOs around forward
strategic decision-making was very, very limited. People were in crisis mode and were very focused on dealing
with the immediacy of the health care crisis and the crisis as it was affecting their businesses.
We had seen over the course of the last six weeks or so, as economies around the world have started to reopen,
a reengagement by clients and CEOs in their forward strategic view. I would say that the dialogue levels right now
are particularly robust. I don't believe that we'll see short-term activity, but I would expect, over the course of the
next two to four quarters, those activity levels will build as we have a clear understanding as to the overall
direction of the health care issue that we all face and the overall economic impact that comes out of this. And as
people have more confidence, they'll be able to move forward.
You did see one or two significant M&A transactions during the course of the last week. I want to be clear. It's not
shut down, but I think you need a more certain environment with better insight into the health care situation and
the economic situation to see that replenishment normalize. My guess is we'll get that, but it'll take a couple of
quarters for sure.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First one, Stephen, just on the private equity sales this
year, I think you mentioned freeing up about $2 billion of capital. And if I'm not mistaken, I think during the
Investor Day, you guys mentioned, I think it was about $4 billion over a period of three years. So, just curious, is
this more accelerated? Has that opportunity set expanded? Just trying to get an understanding of maybe the pace
of that kind of strategic shift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, you have the facts right. I mean, by the end of the year, as I said, we'll free up about $2 billion, which is
50% of the way toward the objective of $4 billion. I would say that I don't view that $4 billion as being, in any way,
the limit of what we can get done. The more we can advance and increase the cadence on the migration to lower
capital density investing, the better we'll be, and we'll continue to pursue that.
Obviously, there's two sides to this that are both progressing. I mean, on one hand, we're effectuating sales that
will relieve us of capital, but we're doing that, not leaving ourselves in kind of a canyon of activity. In that, as we
said during the prepared remarks, we've really advanced on the raise of our first fund inside of 30 days, having a
first close in excess of $6 billion with a target of greater than $10 billion.
And while we set out the objective of doing about $100 billion of raise in and across a range of different funds, I
think we all have an expectation that we'll exceed the $20 billion target we thought we would get to this year and
look to revise targets across all of this, as and when we think it appropriate. But this is good forward progress, and
we're very determined to see it happen.

Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up, just on the trading activity, David, I think you mentioned just higher
activity year-over-year even in the past couple weeks. Just when you think about it, profit, products and client
type, obviously, we have ongoing volatility and uncertainty that kind of benefits the industry, are you seeing any –
I don't know if I want to say like structural shifts in terms of Goldman share gains, more use of the electronic
platforms, additional client relationships that can maybe be more sustainable once some of this volatility starts to
subside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I appreciate the question, Michael. There are a number of things going on that we've highlighted, but to
summarize or maybe put it in a different context that frames your question, one of the things we've done over the
last two years is we've thought very, very carefully about our Global Markets franchise, the way we wanted to
center that franchise, which was really around our clients. We invested in a One GS approach that we've talked
about that really tries to improve the client experience for our clients across that franchise. And we started making
an investment in those relationships, improving wallet gaps, improving shares.
That's an investment we started two years ago that was paying dividends. But I think what you saw, given the
increased volatility and the heightened activity on the part of our clients, we saw an acceleration of the benefits of
some of that investment during the course of the end of the first quarter and the second quarter.
I think the real share gains there – I'm getting a lot of feedback from clients directly that they really appreciate the
way we've invested in the client centricity of that business, the way we've kept the strong investment and really
meeting their needs. And I think we've reaped some dividends from that investment. Now, as that continues, we'll
work to protect those share gains.
But I'd also highlight, I still think there's upside for us when I look across the 100 largest players in that business,
and I look at our share across the 100 largest players and where we're top three with the 100 largest players.
While we've made progress, I think we still have upside in the medium term, if we continue to execute on our
strategy to take more wallet share, given the strength and the breadth of our franchise. And we're going to
continue to remain focused on that.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, just a couple questions. One, I know that earlier, there was a question around capital and how to utilize capital
most efficiently. And I wanted to raise it with regard to how – seeing VaR traject over this past quarter. And I'm
wondering, is there an opportunity here, given the capital generation that you've been enabled to do and also the
RWA compression, that we lean into the VaR and keep VaR relatively high? I know in the quarter it was up
significantly Q-on-Q. But how much of that is market-related? And how much do you anticipate running at maybe
a higher VaR than you have had in the past, given your capital flexibility that you have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, I think the premise of your question, Betsy, sort of strikes at the answer, which is we do have capital flexibility
to elevate our VaR, using VaR as a basis or as a metric, if you will, for extending into client needs. So, both
responding to the need for intermediation and positions, deploying capital against it, and equally being responsive
to the possibility of the market inflating, such that VaR increases in the context of inflated notional positions with
particular credits.
And so, I think we feel very comfortable. And part of the reason to take up our capital to sort of adequate levels
relative to where we will be required to be, I think gives us greater confidence to see VaR inflate, to the extent that
we are in a position to serve our clients in periods of continued uncertainty, as David's been speaking about in the
markets more broadly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And was there anything this quarter in particular that drove VaR? I guess, last quarter it was an $81 million
average VaR, and this quarter was $122 million. I know that's total. But it was up across the board in the various
categories. Maybe if you could speak to what you saw in this quarter that drove that VaR up, and what you think
could be sustained into the second half of the year, and what that means for trading revenues? Jamie yesterday
said, you should cut in half your trading revenues for 3Q, but where do you stand on that kind of question?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Well, I don't think any of us are in a position to make such a declarative judgment about exact direction of trading
revenues and through the second half of the year. I think that what we need to do is set ourselves up to be in the
service of clients and avail ourselves for the benefit of our shareholders of the opportunities as they present. And I
think David characterized it well, which is the second half will be more characterized by uncertainty than any
ability to forecast up or down in the market itself. And I think we're well-positioned from a liquidity, from a capital
and from a risk point of view to be able to avail ourselves.
The one thing I would say, as we think about risk in markets like this, is drawing the distinction between what's
liquid and what's not. So, when I look at the firm, I think that inventory was managed in the pursuit of
intermediation in the trading business exceptionally well. We saw very high velocity, as we've long been looking to
work with our Securities leadership to do, in terms of seeing quicker turnover in inventory in support of trading
activity.
When I look at illiquid, this is an area where, from a risk point of view, we used market opportunities to lower, for
example, commitments made in the deals book and took that book down and took risk down and positioned
ourselves now to take on more risk in through the second half of the year, to the extent that those opportunities
present themselves. And so, I feel quite good and confident about where we stand from a risk position, not limited
what we do in trading activity, which will present itself, but equally around other areas of the firm with more
structural and kind of less liquid risk to take onboard.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, my short question is, look, you're the number one advisor, so what are you advising clients to do? And
how are you allocating the firm's resources to back that up? And the color behind that is, it seems like the
elephant in the room is, look, COVID cases are going up; I think death rates [ph] followed (01:06:32) by about four
weeks, per an expert that we had on a call; and then you have shut downs. And you're seeing the shutdowns, like
in California and elsewhere.
So, there's two scenarios here. One is, maybe Goldman is needed less that investors and your clients go home
and sit on the sidelines, too much risk; or maybe Goldman Sachs is needed more. As you said, more complex
deals, wider bid-offer spreads, elevated volumes, have more of a freak-out market where you guys stay open for
business. So, what are you advising clients? How are you reallocating your resources for that? And what are your
thoughts on my questions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, it's a very uncertain environment, Mike. It's a very uncertain environment. And so, one of the things we're
advising clients is that it's a very uncertain environment, and they have to bring caution and planning to everything
they do. I watch TV and read the news, like everyone else, and I'm sometimes quite surprised by how certain
people are. I continue to be relatively uncertain as to the trajectory of all this.
As I've said before, we need to understand the health care risks associated with the virus and get to a point where
people feel safe and comfortable. Obviously, a vaccine would be a meaningful step forward with respect to that.
While there's no question that there's progress with respect to a whole bunch of companies that are making
20


The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
significant investments in a vaccine, and there was positive news again this morning, the exact trajectory of that
and how it'll be deployed, and whether it'll work, and the effectiveness of all of that is still unclear and uncertain.
I'm confident we will get through this, but the timing and the impact is relatively uncertain. We've also, because of
the shutdowns economically all around the world, have slowed economic activity. There's no question, as
reopenings occurred, we've seen a pickup in that activity. But with an increase in viruses and this uncertainty
persisting, I think you'll see a flattening in that economic pickup, and that will slow the progress we make
economically from here. So, we continue to revise clients to be thoughtful and cautious about that.
With respect to Goldman Sachs being open, and ready and willing to serve our clients, there's no question, in the
second quarter, that our clients were extremely active, and we were there to support them. It's unclear how active
they'll be in the third quarter, but there will be activity. We'll be open. And at the end of the third quarter, we can
kind of look back and say how that unfolded. But I think we've proven and we'll continue to prove, with great
humility, that we can be flexible, we can work remotely, we can adapt, and we can also help clients adapt.
And so this is a very challenging time for everyone. The human toll of this crisis is really very significant. Everyone
is focused on their employees. Everyone is focused on their businesses and their stakeholders and their
shareholders. And I think that people need to be cautious, because the economic repercussions of this will play
out over the medium term. And this is not going to be, in my opinion, a quick resolution. And we'll continue to try
to be nimble and flexible and help our clients navigate what I think will continue to be a very uncertain period.

As a follow-up, just as it relates to capital markets, we're all trying to fill in our models for the next several
quarters. What could be the next step in capital markets in terms of repositioning of portfolios due to the election,
and another government stimulus, or reamplification continuing; or you mentioned mergers, where you said
volumes are still above the level last year, even if coming down? People tend to give you a PE of 1 on your
earnings, like a quarter such as this, whereas you talk about the annuity with your clients. So, I'm just trying to
figure out kind of what's the next step with capital markets at Goldman Sachs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think our capital markets businesses have long been a leader, and we've been positioned as a very, very
strong leader in M&A advisory activity and equity underwriting activity for decades. We've made a significant
investment over the last decade in our debt capital markets business, and I think over the last few years, you've
seen the benefits of that investment. And I think we're very well-positioned to help our clients meet their capital
markets needs.
Capital markets is a volatile business, yet through the cycle our capital markets businesses produced significant
activity and significant profitability. I don't have a crystal ball as to what's going to happen in the next six months.
I've had some discussions with people, where people talk about some capital markets activity being pulled
forward. And there's no question that some refinancing has been pulled forward. At the same point, there's been a
whole bunch of activity that we could have never imagined would have recurred because of the virus and the
economic consequences of the shutdowns.
So, when you look at industries like airlines and cruise, and travel and leisure, there's been an enormous amount
of capital markets activity that was completely unanticipated. And so, as we look forward over the next six
months, I think there'll be other things based on the macro environment that will either lead to a pickup in some

places or a decrease. The one thing I know for sure is our franchise, on a global basis, is very well-positioned to
meet our clients' needs as that activity occurs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that – and this goes back to the initial question you asked,
which is, what are we doing with our clients? I mean, you can look in the capital markets at the need to apply
more creativity to structured solutions for clients than perhaps what we've seen in kind of straightway issuance in
more normalized markets.
Look at the deal that was completed for United Airlines, which I think brings some interesting ingenuity and
structure to what otherwise, in the normal course, would have been a fairly straightway financing. And I think
that's the nature and level of engagement with the clients that we're experiencing. And I think it responds a bit to
the question of where the capital markets are going. There may be more of a need of that, right, in the uncertainty
that David's been addressing.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate all the time. This quarter you guys made a purchase of
Folio, an RIA platform. And was kind of curious, if you could maybe give a little color on that, was that purely for
use by United Capital, or is there interest in providing third-party custody services in the RIA space, which is a
market where we're seeing some consolidation? And there's a lot there. We're going from three to two strong
providers of pure custody, so just curious if that's part of the plan there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think the way to think about it is, is that, in the end, we're looking to continue to build out kind of three
components of that business. There's obviously our Ultra-High Net Worth business; there's the High Net Worth
business, PFM, which was the United Capital. I think Folio serves to clearly provide added heft to that component
of what we're trying to build. The third leg in that stool would obviously be a more mass affluent consumer piece.
But the acquisition of Folio was clearly aligned with the strategy begun under United Capital and the provision of
third-party custody more broadly. So, I think it fits both a generalized strategy, but equally, it is entirely consistent
with what we were trying to build out in the High Net Worth or PFM space, which was the United Capital asset
itself.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thinking about your comments on the M&A market, interesting and very helpful about the pickup in dialogue in
the last six weeks. And clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty, as you flagged with health care and the economic
trajectory. But we also hear about the election uncertainty holding back some component of activity in the US. Are
you seeing a difference or a significant divergence in the level of dialogue in the United States versus other
geographies? And is it the other geographies that's leading to the greater engagement, or are you seeing it pick
up in the US as well? Just the nuance on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, sure, Brennan. And what I would say is, I don't see a difference in engagement levels in the US versus, let's
say, the rest of the world. Engagement levels were way down. Engagement levels are picking up everywhere.
While the election is certainly something that I think will get a lot of attention over the next five months, it's still five
months away. And I think that the health care crisis and the economic crisis as a result of the health care crisis
has had a much bigger impact on engagement levels than the election. As to how the election starts to impact
decision-making, I can see it, in some ways, being an accelerant; and in some ways, potentially creating
uncertainty and slowing things down. But I don't think the election cycle is yet playing a big role in client
engagement.

So, just want to drill a little bit more into the progress in Transaction Banking. And really just trying to think about
the scaling in that business, 175 clients today and making some progress on deposits. I guess, where do you feel
like you are in terms of market share with those clients? So, are they kind of test driving the platform today, but
there's still kind of a huge opportunity of maybe more penetration? And then, as you think about kind of scaling
that platform, kind of what are they using today? Why are they using Goldman Sachs? And what's the opportunity
to do more with them?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Sure. Appreciate the question, and I know there's been a lot of interest in this. There's also been a lot of questions
about our ability to execute on this. If you go back strategically, one of the reasons that we were very confident in
building this platform is we were a big customer of other institutions, and we saw a need based through our own
experience. And we've really put together what we think is a very, very friction-free digital platform that advances
the connectivity that clients have to their financial institution and ease-of-use in very, very meaningful ways.
The rollout has gone very, very well. I think we've been very cautious and conservative, as we talked about it,
particularly at Investor Day around client take-up. I think one of the reasons we felt comfortable that we could
build a platform and attract clients to it, if we built a good platform, is that we have relationships with all these
clients. These relationships are real. They rely on us. We lend to these clients. And if we had an offering that was
competitive, we felt it was a reasonable ask of our clients to consider our offering.
I think what you've seen in this initial rollout is a lot of clients have considered our offering. And the first and
easiest way to consider it is to leave deposits with us, to onboard, get an account, see the ease of use in doing
that and leave deposits with us. And so, I think that's accelerated at a much faster pace than we expected.
We have had a handful of significant clients turn operational, which is obviously where the business becomes
much more attractive to us. And I would expect over the course of the medium term, we will grow a very
substantial business, where these clients become operational on our platform, and that will lead to significant fee-
based revenue streams that will help that business grow. But we're in the very early stages. Our market share is
tiny. We don't have enormous market share aspirations, but we will grow this business, we believe, nicely over the
medium term. And it will make a reasonable contribution to the overall diversification of Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay, terrific. Appreciate that. And then just a follow-up question, just around the comp ratio. So, year-to-date, the
accrual is 35% versus 36% last year in the first half. So, I'm trying to just kind of parse through how much of that
is actually some of those expense savings coming through versus maybe leverage on mix, or the fact that
revenues were up 20%. So, trying to think about the accrual, and how you guys are thinking about that relative to
where you were last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, the way we think about it is that in each and every quarter, we take an accrual as at that quarter as to
what we forecast we need to pay the organization and compensate the organization on a pay-for-performance
basis, and it's not more than that. There's no signaling that's embedded in it or otherwise.
I think a good deal of the savings is not anticipated in the context of lowering our comp ratio. It's really looking at
the balance of expenses that I was addressing to an earlier question in terms of what we can do to bring down
some of the non-comp expense, and overall, bring our operating expenses down. But fixing this at 35% – as you
may remember, we were at 33.8% last year, and so this is an ongoing quarter-by-quarter assessment of what we
need to do, taking a look at the overall performance of the business itself.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on the SCB and DFAST. Just trying to – if we look at trading, as you
guys pointed out, and I agree, you've seen almost a countercyclicality in trading revenues holding up very well in
this kind of a stress test we just had from COVID, yet losses in trading through DFAST are still pretty high.
So, when we think about your SCB going forward, do you think there's any opportunity of sort of the Fed sort of
recalculating how they think about trading losses, which could be a benefit to you, or is simply the view to get the
SCB sort of down is to just continue to do what you're doing over time and remix assets? Just trying to see if you
think there's a potential for a little benefit from the performance over the last six months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So I would say that for us, pursuing both paths of petition and action is right, meaning there's a do-it-
yourself proposition here, which is to drive what we've been talking about, that is lower capital intensity of balance
sheet investing, third-party funds, and the like. All of that is subject to self-help, and we are minded to
aggressively address that, so as to bring the intensity down.
As a related matter, I think, as you would imagine, we have been very active in our engagement and discussions
with the Fed about the very observation you're making, which is when we look back historically at our own
performance, volatility carries a positive correlation to trading revenue. And it's not uncorrelated. And we have a
view about what that means in the context of what the downdraft would be and have been engaged in a very
active dialogue with the Fed on that topic. How to handicap the outcome of that is an impossibility, and so it is
why, notwithstanding that petition, we continue to engage in self-help and look to remedy this on our own terms.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Well, it's good to hear you're at least asking. And just maybe one quick follow-up on the advanced CET1. Given
the SCB is based on standardized, I mean, is there any constraints? Does it matter, the advanced CET1? I hate
to say it that way, but does it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think the rating agencies appropriately take a look at the advanced. And remember, this has the CVA
component in it that's not represented in standardized. And so you've got to be mindful in managing all of these
capital ratios that there's not one, but many constituencies to bear in mind. And so, we do that and obviously pay
attention to all of these ratios in the context of how we carry ourselves.

Sure. Thanks. Just one real quick one on credit. Is there any way you guys could give an update on kind of where
you're at with regards to deferrals and delinquencies? And then, also how you're thinking about reserve builds
from here? I mean, you've built the reserve, a decent amount this quarter. I mean, is this the peak or are you guys
sufficiently reserved for go-forward losses? Thanks.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So why don't I start on deferrals or forbearance. So, it's quite light across our whole portfolio. There's only
3% of total credit itself that is subject to forbearance. It's higher in the Consumer portfolio. It's been about 10% of
the total portfolio that has taken up forbearance. Interestingly, of those that do, about 50% are current on their
payments. But bear in mind, that's a very small component of the overall risk profile of the firm at $7 billion total.
So, over across the whole of it, it's about 3%. It's not significant in the context of how we operate and how we
think about the risk, overall, given how low it is.
I would say, as it relates to the consumer, it is one reason why the coverage ratio that we have through our
reserve on a consumer portfolio is as high as it is at 17%. That's not at all a reflection of our current experience in
terms of losses. Losses actually are trending lower, notwithstanding the moment in the market. But out of
prudence and caution, and given how young that portfolio is, and given the fact that forbearance can mask risk,
we've taken up our provision there.
More generally, on your question about provisioning, as you note, we took a provision of $1.6 billion in the
quarter. The methodology we use is the same we did in the first, and will hold ourselves going forward, which is
we look at macroeconomic indicators including unemployment that sort of correlate well to expectations around
default rates, and then pull that through to avail ourselves of pool reserves.
And we broke that down in the prepared remarks, which amounted to about $700 million of the $1.6 billion that's
there, with the balance being impairments and the Consumer component of provisions that I spoke about. It
leaves us with a coverage ratio of about 3.7%, which I think is roughly in line with where the market is, and
accurately reflecting risk that's there. So what happens in the forward, it'll purely be a function of what plays out in
the market and whether certain of these macroeconomic indicators worsen or improve from here. And that
obviously will flow through our model and dictate the level of provisioning we take.
