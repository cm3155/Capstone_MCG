Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter 2020 financial results. I want to begin our call this
morning by saying that our thoughts go out to all those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. This is an event
without parallel for our company, our region and our nation. We recognize that our clients and communities
depend on us now more than ever.
As a company that serves a vital role in the economies of our footprint, we see, firsthand, the impact that this
crisis has on individuals and companies and we remain committed to helping our clients through this trouble time.
And while our call will detail our first quarter results, we'll spend a significant amount of time today discussing the
impact of this new economic environment on our company. As Steven mentioned, we have a big lineup today that
should provide insight into our response and our outlook relative to COVID-19.
With respect to the first quarter, BOK Financial recorded net income of $62.1 million and diluted earnings per
share of $0.88. Earnings this quarter were impacted dramatically from a shifting economic outlook and falling oil

prices that drove the significant increase in our loan loss provisions under the newly adopted CECL accounting
standards, which Marc Maun will talk about in detail a bit later.
Not to minimize expected credit losses, but if we focus on pre-provision net revenue in comparison to previous
quarters, the results were really solid. Pre-provision net revenue was $173.1 million this quarter versus $160
million last quarter and $148.2 million for the first quarter last year, showcasing the contribution of our diversified
mix of business revenues.
Net interest revenue declined $8.9 million to $261.4 million this quarter. Despite multiple rate cuts in the latter half
of 2019 and 150 basis points of emergency rate cuts in March of 2020, LIBOR has remained relatively elevated.
This, combined with our ability to decrease deposit costs, has preserved a large portion of our margin.
Steven will talk later about actions we've taken to position the balance sheet and drive deposit costs further down.
Our brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenues continue to outperform on strong mortgage-backed
securities trading and mortgage loan production volumes. Fees and commissions revenue was up over 7% from
last quarter, building on the previous year's momentum, while mortgage banking revenues grew over 46% on a
linked-quarter basis.
As you can imagine, the growth in this area accelerated in the last month in the first quarter and likely will
continue to be a leader in coming quarters.
Expense management was excellent this quarter as well with expenses down 7% compared to last quarter. While
decreased incentive compensation was the main driver this quarter, we also took several steps related to delaying
the filling of open positions and reducing discretionary spend in detail later in the call, which should help expense
levels for the remainder of this year.
Turning to slide 5, period-end loans were $22.5 billion, up over [ph] 30% (00:04:58) from last quarter. While this
was positive for the company overall, a significant portion of this was due to increased draws, particularly in our
commercial and industrial portfolio.
Period-end deposits were up nearly 6% linked-quarter and up over 15% year-over-year, a continuation of the
streak we demonstrated in 2019. Even with the significant growth in deposits, we were able to bring overall
interest-bearing deposit costs down from 1.09% in the fourth quarter to 0.98% this quarter as we were able to
adjust rates paid on exception price deposits in our commercial portfolio much more quickly than expected.
Assets under management or in custody were understandably down for the quarter as equity markets weighed on
asset prices. That said, prudent diversification of our clients' assets helped us to relatively outperform the broad
market sell-off. In addition, we saw an opportunity to invest further in our company this quarter as we bought back
442,000 BOKF shares at $75.52 per share in the open market.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results after the prepared remarks. But now, I'll turn it over to Marty
Grunst, our Chief Risk Officer, to cover our business resiliency and employee safety response to the coronavirus
pandemic. Marty and his team were instrumental in making sure we were able to respond quickly, while also
maintaining business continuity throughout our footprint.
Marty?

Martin E. Grunst
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Steve. I will summarize the steps we have taken since activating our business continuity plan. At the
outset, our Chief Human Resources Officer and I established a dual mandate of maximizing employee safety and
ensuring continuity of service. We then developed and implemented an array of strategies to accomplish those
goals, including work from home for 70% of our employee base whose jobs can be performed remotely, an array
of social distancing actions for those working in the office, which includes separating work teams among multiple
locations, further separation using split shifts and assigning dedicated entry and exit doors, break rooms and the
like for different teams. We migrated banking centers to a drive-thru and appointment-only format and
subsequently reduced hours a bit and closed some banking centers temporarily to enable more shift rotation.
Enhanced cleaning procedures have been implemented in all our locations. To address increased demand on our
call center and increased volumes in both mortgage and SBA lendings, we have temporarily repositioned
employees from banking centers and other departments all across the firm into those high-demand areas.
And most importantly, we rolled out an array of employee support initiatives in recognition of the changing
environment for our staff. These include up to five days of additional paid time-off, incremental financial support
for employee childcare, waiving co-pays for usage of our telemedicine capability and premium pay for certain non-
exempt employees who need to remain in the office. Our team is ready to support operations in whatever
environment we find ourselves in. Lastly, I would like to offer my thanks to the many employees who have worked
tirelessly these past several weeks to ensure we are there for each other, our customers and our communities.
I'll now turn the call over to Norm Bagwell to cover our response to customer needs. Norm?

Norman P. Bagwell
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks & Chief Executive Officer-Bank of Texas, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. The impact of COVID-19 on many mid-size and small businesses across the nation is
unprecedented. The necessary distancing efforts were not only impactful to businesses with a high reliance on
social gatherings, but the spillover effects are being felt throughout our markets.
Our clients rely on us now more than ever. So our focus has been on coordinating the building of an effective
bridge to clients as most of our bankers have transitioned to working from home. We've engaged our clients in
deep portfolio management discussions focused on the state of business along with managing through the
request for payment deferrals and renewals.
We are also working with clients to right-size interest costs by adjusting earning credit rate and interest rates on
deposits as the interest rate environment has shifted. We have reintroduced interest rate floors where
appropriate. We're having active discussions on interest rate swaps [ph] that are also recurring (00:09:15) and
some of our clients take advantage of the low-rate environment.
New business is being booked as we have been able to pull through pipeline items during this time as well, all the
while we are actually risk-grading our portfolio through the cycle. We've also been incredibly proactive with our
clients in wealth management space. Active management and high-touch client service have been out of favor
recently, but times like these allow us to demonstrate why BOK Financial's wealth management expertise is a
standout amongst peers.

We have employees providing guidance to thousands of clients running from advising individuals on how weather
trying markets with personal assets, they're helping corporate clients reposition their balance sheets. While high-
set service has been facilitated primarily by the phone and e-mail, we were also seeing these clients utilize our
technology at a higher rate.
Our Private Wealth and retail brokerage digital log-ins were up 16% and 6.5% month-over-month, respectively.
And we've seen a 32% increase in digital transactions by participants in our institutional wealth offerings. Our
digital account performance monitoring capabilities have seen dramatic increases in usage as well with some
areas of wealth management staying upwards of 65% increases in performance logins from February to March.
With all of this rapid adoption, continuous digital communication with our clients about the broader economic
factors at play has been a real key.
Most recently, our client discussions have been centered on the CARES Act and it's aimed to provide nearly $350
billion of loans to small businesses via the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program or PPP.
As a certified SBA lender, BOKF was open for PPP business the day the program went live on Friday, April 3.
Hundreds of our employees were redeployed from their typical roles in commercial banking and consumer
banking working tirelessly to take applications and reserve funding for their clients.
Feedback from our clients as it relates to our ability to respond has been very positive and proven differentiated
versus our peers.
I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to serve our clients and communities by helping them bridge this time of
economic uncertainty. BOK Financial has processed approximately 4,700 completed PPP applications and we've
received $1.8 billion SBA approvals.
While we would characterize our quick action for our clients as a success, it was not without its challenges. The
short 10-day funding window presented a bit of an operational burden, but we have successfully met that
standard. Additionally, the sheer volume of applications for our credit services team in such a short time was
challenging to say the least, but the resiliency and flexibility of our credit team has proved out. In fact, enhanced
quality control checks were put in place during this time to ensure [ph] accuracy and (00:12:08) viability of the
applications.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Stacy to cover our energy, healthcare and commercial real estate portfolios.
Stacy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Norm. As you can see on slide 11, period-end loans were $22.5 billion, up more than 3% for the quarter.
Our commercial real estate was largely flat this quarter. C&I expanded over 5% from the previous quarter,
primarily in the general business, energy and healthcare portfolios.
In general, the traditional C&I portfolio had growth that was a combination of both seasonal factors and customer
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These revolving lines of credit are generally secured and governed by a
borrowing base. And in many cases, the customer draws were deposited back into the bank.
There were very limited draw request in the specialized lines of business in response to the current macro
environment. Line of credit draws have leveled off and are relatively unchanged since the end of March. Energy
loans outstanding totaled $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter or 18% of total loans. Our energy exposure has

created volatility in our stock price, but supporting the energy industry has been a hallmark of the company for
over a century.
On slide 12, you can see that the majority of this portfolio is first lean, senior secured, reserve-based lending to oil
and gas producers which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. A decline in the demand for energy
related to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the OPEC+ production conflict, has led the declines in the current
spot in future oil prices. Approximately, 62% of our committed production loans are secured by properties
primarily producing oil. The remaining 38% are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas, which has
not been significantly impacted by the recent events.
Most clients had a production mix of oil and natural gas. As we have said in the past, we believe the duration of
the oil price decline is a more significant factor affecting performance than the level of prices. If drivers of this
decline are short term, meaning less than 12 months, then our expected losses in the portfolio will not be overly
impactful to the company.
One factor that is much more in our favor during this downturn is customer hedges that are in place. Of all energy
customers that we stress test, which makes up 92% of production loans outstanding, 95% of those customers
have some level hedging in the 12-month range and many of them carrying into the 24-month range.
We believe the combination of our disciplined underwriting approach and customer hedging positions will work to
weather this downturn as we have previous downturns. Our healthcare sector loan balances increased $131
million to $3.2 billion or 14% of total loans.
On slide 13, you can see that our healthcare sector loans primarily consist of $2.4 billion of senior housing and
care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally, we lend to borrowers
with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risk specific to a single facility.
We have had a few instances of COVID-19 among a handful of facilities, but the response of our healthcare
operators has mitigated any significant impact up to this point. The remaining balance of our healthcare portfolio
is comprised of hospitals and other medical service providers who have also been impacted by a deferral of
elective procedures to ensure adequate protective equipment and ventilators for those providing acute care for
virus patients.
It should also be pointed out that the CARES Act has multiple revenue-enhancement measures for both hospitals
and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the risks of the virus. We remain confident in the long-term
outlook in this space and expect it to continue to be a growth leader once the health and economic conditions
migrate to a more normal state.
Commercial real estate loan balances were largely unchanged from the last quarter, representing 20% of total
loans. Looking a little deeper into this segment on slide 14, loan secured by office buildings and other properties
increased the total of $141 million this quarter. This increase was largely offset by a decrease of $128 million of
loans secured by industrial facilities. Multifamily residential loans are our largest segment on commercial real
estate lending totaling $1.3 billion at quarter-end.
Loans secured by retail facilities were $774 million at March 31. As we think about real estate more broadly, we
enter this downturn relatively well-positioned. We have traditionally limited CRE to 175% of Tier 1 capital, which
supplements our category, construction, tenant and state.

At March 31, our legacy commercial real estate portfolio was under all our limits and sub-limits. Clearly, the retail
portion of this portfolio is the most vulnerable to sustain stay-at-home and shelter-in-place directives. This portfolio
is roughly split between goods and services. As of the end of 2019, the retail CRE segment had a weighted
average regulatory loan-to-value of 58% and a weighted average debt service coverage of almost 1.5 times.
As with oil, the lost content in retail will be closely correlated with the duration of the various governmental orders
and adjustments in consumer behavior after these orders are lifted. While office and multifamily will see impact
here, we believe our geographic footprint will help us in these segments in the long term because of the strong in-
migration over time.
We will not be able to avoid the impacts of all the macroeconomic credit issues impacting financial institutions. We
have historically proven to be disciplined underwriters of credit. The last cycle certainly demonstrated that and we
remain confident our standards will perform well in the current cycle.
I'll turn the call over to Marc Maun to discuss other loan portfolios, credit metrics and the impact of CECL
implementation. Marc?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 16, we've compiled a list of loan segments we consider more exposed to the
economic slowdown driven by the social distancing measures in place to combat the coronavirus. As you can
see, the exposure to entertainment and recreation, retail, hotels, churches, airline travel and higher education that
are dependent on large social gatherings to remain profitable is roughly 7.7% of our total portfolio.
This group of loans is highly diversified with over 550 loans for an average loan size of less than $3 million. Some
of these clients will participate in the Paycheck Protection Program that will provide some measure of relief to
stress that they may be feeling. We'll obviously be monitoring these exposures closely in the coming months.
Just a few words from my seat as Chief Credit Officer on the energy portfolio that Stacy described above. On the
energy side, the spring borrowing base redetermination season is underway and we will be engineering the value
of our customers' reserves during the second quarter. We also conduct a quarterly stress test of our energy
borrowers with more than 50% funding on their lines of credit and all criticized loans using a price deck
discounted by 20%, which helps us identify potential issues. The most recent stress test, which takes customer
hedges into consideration, resulted in no surprises.
On slide 17, you can see credit quality has remained well intact to this point. But our expectation is to see
migration of non-accrual and potential problem loans given the current economic environment. Additionally, we
have taken action regarding loan modification requests on a case by case basis. Requests have generally been
for 90 days of principal and possibly interest with a re-evaluation at the end of that period for another 90 days.
Based on the recent regulatory guidance, these loans are not considered troubled debt restructures if they are in
correct status as of March 1, 2020. Non-accruing loans decreased $17.8 million this quarter, primarily due to a
$19 million decrease in non-accruing commercial real estate loans. However, non-accruing energy loans
increased $4.7 million in the first quarter. New non-accruing loans identified in the first quarter totaled $30 million,
offset by $9 million in payments and received a $19 million in charge-offs.
Potential problem loans totaled $293 million at March 31, up from $160 million at December 31. This increase
largely comes from the energy portfolio as the recent oil price declines, coupled with the capital markets

environment requiring certain customers to work through their liquidity needs, weighed on some energy
borrowers. This situation may lead to additional non-accruals and some impairments.
As Steve noted in his opening comments, the company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2020, and we have
increased total reserves by $131.5 million since 12/31.
Slide 18 shows the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision under CECL. The day
one adjustment shows an increase in ACL reserves of $49.4 million. The total day one adjustment includes an
additional $12 million for mortgage banking activities and HTM securities for a total of $61.4 million, which is what
we disclosed last quarter, and that amount impacted capital, not earnings this quarter.
The day two provision for credit losses under CECL was $93.8 million for the first quarter. A degrading
macroeconomic outlook during the first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price declines were the
two factors most impacting the CECL calculations. In those calculations, the company used base case, downside
and upside economic scenarios, including key economic indicators such as gross domestic product,
unemployment and oil prices.
Assumptions used in the scenarios for the second quarter of 2020 range from negative 10% to negative 30% for
GDP, 6% to almost 10% for unemployment and $19 to $27 for oil prices. The forward view of the economy
improves modestly over the remaining quarters of 2020. Other economic factors used in the models include credit
spreads, home price indexes and vacancy rates. More detail will be provided in our first quarter 10-Q to support
sensitivity analysis of these factors as it relates to our total portfolio.
Portfolio changes represent the impact of shifts in loan balances, age and mix as well as credit quality, adding
$16 million to the ACL. First quarter provision expense also included $17.2 million related to net charge-off
activity. Our allowance for loan losses after day one and day two first quarter provision totaled $315 million plus
another $28.5 million recorded in other liabilities to cover unfunded loan commitments. Although the entire
reserve from loan losses is available to cover losses in any portfolio, $100 million is attributed to our outstanding
energy portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to Steven Nell. Steven?

Thanks, Marc.
As noted on slide 20, net interest revenue for the quarter was $261 million, down $8.9 million from the fourth
quarter. Net interest margin was 2.80%, down only 8 basis points from the previous quarter as LIBOR has
remained elevated relative to its historical relationship to other short-term market interest rates. This coupled with
our ability to move interest-bearing deposit costs down 11 basis points has allowed us to preserve a large portion
of our margin. While the 150 basis points of interest rate cuts by the Fed in March did have an impact on both net
interest revenue and net interest margin, the full effect will be realized in the second quarter.
The most significant component of net interest revenue and net interest margin that we can most influence is
deposit costs. We're working closely with our depositors to secure and maintain balances but price appropriately
given the almost-zero rate environment at which we operate. In the month of March, our interest-bearing deposit
cost declined to 79 basis points and we believe we can continue to lower our costs over the coming months.

On slide 21, fees and commissions were $193 million, an increase of 7.4% from last quarter and 20% quarterly
year-over-year, continuing to be primarily fueled by strength in our brokerage and trading and mortgage
businesses. We generated record revenues in our trading and derivative businesses this quarter with total
brokerage and trading revenues eclipsing $50 million. The majority of this was derived from mortgage related
trading activity with first quarter MBS/TBA trading revenue of $31.7 million, a 40% increase over linked quarter
and a 212% increase from the same quarter a year ago.
While the growth rates here are impressive, even more impressive was that this increased revenue from
mortgage trading activity was partially muted by a decrease in the fair value of asset backed and municipal
securities due to widening spreads. Given the lower rates and higher volatility in the mortgage markets, our
traders have done a phenomenal job supporting our clients' management and repositioning of their investment
and hedging portfolios.
Mortgage banking saw a significant surge in production revenue this quarter, growing $11.8 million or over 46%
relative to last quarter and almost 56% from the same quarter a year ago. Total mortgage production volume
increased to over $1 billion from three finances representing 57% of that volume. Additionally, we increased our
gain on sale margins by 62 basis points compared to last quarter.
Another success story of the quarter relates to the hedging of our mortgage servicing rights. Given the speed and
magnitude of the decline in mortgage rates, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights declined $88.5 million
in the first quarter. However, our securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge offset $86.8
million of that decline. The securities held as hedges also yielded net interest revenue of $4.6 million. So the net
MSR activity resulted in a $2.6 million benefit this quarter, an impressive outcome for this environment.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue was down just over 1% this quarter, which might be a surprise to some
given the perceived market sensitivity of this segment. In reality, only about a third of these assets are exposed to
equities today which has added resiliency through the cycle. Strong sales efforts coupled with this prudent
diversification proved out with relative outperformance. Many of our fee businesses are clearly off to a great start
this year and once again highlight the significance of the revenue diversity that our company has.
Turning to slide 22, total operating expenses decreased a little more than $20 million, down 7% from the fourth
quarter. Personnel expense decreased $12.2 million this quarter, largely due to the combination of a decrease in
both deferred compensation and regular compensation of $2.2 million. Additionally, the fourth quarter included
approximately $2 million in severance costs due to realignment of personnel that did not recur.
Employee benefits increased $3.6 million as a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan expenses
was partially offset by decreased employee healthcare costs. Non-personnel expense decreased as well, down
$7.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Mortgage banking costs decreased $3.7 million, largely due to the
reduction in MSR amortization expense. Business promotion expense decreased $2.6 million due to the seasonal
decrease in advertising costs, combined with reduced travel costs as a result of the current pandemic. In addition,
the fourth quarter included a $2 million charitable contribution to the BOKF foundation which did not recur this
quarter.
As Steve alluded to earlier, we have taken steps to help maintain lower expense levels for the remainder of 2020.
First, we have put a hold on all planned adds to staff and are challenging all positions that become open before
we recruit a replacement. Second, we will achieve savings in business promotion, [ph] special (00:29:40)
consulting fees and occupancy-related expenses in the current work-from-home environment. And lastly, we've
decided to delay all nonessential IT and other projects in this less than favorable operating environment. We'll

continue to support client-facing initiatives that enhance our customers' overall experience and other important
projects in support of infrastructure. Prioritizing and slowing the pace of less-critical projects is prudent until the
economic picture becomes clear.
While our liquidity remains strong given the extraordinary impact of the pandemic on the capital markets, we've
taken a number of precautionary measures to ensure it remains so, including enhanced daily monitoring of our
liquidity by tracking deposit inflows and outflows by customer, analyzing loan advances by segment, optimizing
our borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, and increasing our collateral to Federal Reserve
Discount Window among other things.
As mentioned earlier, our deposit balances and ability to gather additional deposits have remained strong. As
noted on slide 23, we have over $12 billion of secured borrowing capacity and over $7 billion of unsecured and
contingent liquidity capacity to support the liquidity needs of the company. Additionally, we're in a position to fund
PPP loans now totaling $1.8 billion via the Federal Reserve PPP liquidity facility.
Our capital position also remains strong. In fact, it was a noted reason that BOKF, NA, the primary source of
holding company liquidity, had its A rating reaffirmed recently by S&P and Moody's. With a common equity tier 1
ratio of 10.9%, well ahead of our internal operating range minimum and a full 390 basis points above regulatory
minimums, we are in good shape. We will also take advantage of the OCC's capital phase-in plan for CECL
implementation.
And lastly, a word on guidance. Due to the uncertainty around the severity and duration of the pandemic and its
impact on the broader economy, we will not provide the more formal guidance we've given in the past, but we'll
leave with a few thoughts that might be helpful. Apart from the loan advances to-date of $751 million and the PPP
fundings of $1.8 billion, we expect no loan growth for the foreseeable future.
Energy deals will likely not be done at current prices, healthcare opportunities are generally on hold due to the
pandemic, and little activity will be present in our CRE and C&I portfolios. We will continue to originate mortgage
loans with a very limited amount ending up in our permanent portfolio. We will continue to reduce deposit costs,
ensuring our deposits are appropriately priced given the near-zero rate environment all in the context of overall
funding needs.
We took advantage of the dramatic widening of mortgage spreads in the first quarter to pre-invest several months
of anticipated cash flows from our available-for-sale securities portfolio at significantly advantageous spreads.
After those anticipated casuals have been realized, we will resume reinvesting in mortgage-backed securities with
appropriate spreads and controlled prepayment and extension characteristics.
Our diversity revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall earnings pressure
being felt in the spread businesses. Our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non-personnel cost will
continue. We have no plans to cut existing capabilities or products and although we will slow less-critical projects,
we'll continue to provide funding for improvements in the client experience in technology infrastructure. We
entered this downturn with a strong capital position and do not see a threat to the dividends we pay. As always we
view stock buybacks optimistically but within the context of maintaining our strong capital position. I'll turn the call
back to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Thanks, Steven. The first quarter as we describe contains some positive operating results. No doubt, the Day 2
CECL provision was meaningful and we can't predict at this point what subsequent quarters will hold. We've yet to
spend the full quarter in a near zero rate environment this year, so we fully expect that to weigh on our spread
businesses going forward. That, coupled with a self-induced economic slowdown took a bath to spread of the
virus will dampen growth for all financial institutions in 2020.
That said, there are several bright spots specifically at BOKF namely, in our wealth management and mortgage
businesses that have every opportunity to outperform in 2020. As always, we are taking a measured approach to
all decisions. We are absorbing the impact of much lower asset rates while looking for the best cost alternatives in
funding going forward. We have strong liquidity and capital so we have the luxury of making thoughtful changes
that won't inhibit our growth opportunities when this environment corrects as it inevitably will.
In the meantime, we will continue to work to manage expenses where possible, putting some projects on hold and
curtailing personnel growth as well as other measures until we see a definite improvement in demand. I would say
that we've added some negative bias since the quarter end as we seek to understand the long road ahead for the
return of meaningful economic activity.
We can envision a GDP decline and rate of unemployment in the second quarter that is more severe than what
we modeled at quarter end. But these are uncharted waters for us all, so we will respond on behalf of our

Thought we might as well start off with energy. I know you said that 95% of your customers have some level of
hedging. So, hopefully, I would like to know how much hedging? But the real question is could you just talk about
the credit quality of either the energy loans or the borrowers that either don't have any hedging at all or even part
of that 95% on that part of their production that is not hedged, i.e., is that much more at risk? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. I'll speak to the customer heading. Over three quarters of our current oil-weighted commitments are
at least 50% hedged in 2020 at an average price in excess of $55. So we feel very good about the level of
hedging that we have within our customer base and really that is one of the most extraordinary mitigants of the
downside and we continue to point to the time horizon as being the bigger risk than the absolute price of the
commodity.
Clearly, as you go into the cycle, we came into the cycle with a relatively good book. We had some certain
customers who had a certain level of weakness. But as we look at that going into this, we feel very good about
that. And I think that that as we position ourselves for the time horizon, we're going to be in a shape that's very
manageable for us.
Just to remind everybody because we get awfully focused on the spot price and what's happening on The Daily
Ticker. Oil prices collapsed in 2008/2009 from $141 a barrel to $34 a barrel in a short period of time. In 2014, we
saw another oil price collapse from $105 a barrel to $26 a barrel in a relatively short time. During that period of
time, natural gas was also under a significant amount of pressure.
In the five-year period ending at the end of 2019, our cumulative losses from the last collapse over a five-year
period was $89 million. We don't know the length or duration of this cycle, but we do know that we've done a good
job historically of underwriting energy credits. And so, we feel very confident in our ability to work through and

manage this. But our focus is not on short-term pricing, but on the long-term curve because we believe that's
more indicative of how our customers will perform over time.

Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
...I'm just going to add one quick thing to this is that even today looking at this, the forward curve, we need to keep
in mind that it's highly contango, it's very steep. So, even if customers, even after looking at for the last couple of
days, if you look at even later this year and into 2021, you're seeing prices that are reaching $30 or over $30 a
barrel. So, there is opportunity on those customers who were not hedged that they have opportunity for us to work
with them to identify ways that we can enhance their overall quality of their cash flow by taking a look at hedging
opportunities and working with them in that way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a second question, obviously, you mentioned the LIBOR has
been a big driver of why your NIMs held up as much as it has. If and when LIBOR does start to normalize relative
to fed funds, could you just help us quantify like how meaningful is that to your portfolio and what's it mean for
margin, how much is exposed to LIBOR versus prime for example? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure, Ken. This is Steven Nell. Yeah, LIBOR has held about a 40 to 45 basis point advantage relative to its
historic relationships. It's actually come in about 10 or 15 basis points over the last week. That's somewhat
meaningful because, as you know, 75% roughly of our loan book is variable. And I would say the majority of that
is LIBOR based. And so, we have gotten some advantage from that spread. We do think it will come in over time.
And without giving a specific dollar amount or percentage impact, it will have some narrowing impact on our
margin going forward if it reverts back to a more historical position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
And this is Stacy. The one thing I might add there is we certainly have benefited from the slow fall of LIBOR. It's
really given us time in our deposit base to focus on higher rate deposits and managing through that. If we look at,
we have about $4 billion of what we call exception price deposits, so that we're kind of higher rate than the
standard pricing. We've moved that down over 90 basis points since the end of February through the middle of
14

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
April. So, it's not – there's multiple sides to that equation as we think about the margin going forward, clearly,
we've benefited from LIBOR. But as it's been slow to fall, it's given us time to kind of right-size the pricing on our
broader deposit base which we think will help us as a counterbalance there.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe sticking with credit, first, can you share with us what level of deferral activity you've had in the – specifically
in the at-risk portfolios, energy, healthcare, CRE, that are surrounded by the COVID umbrella that aren't
necessarily classified as TDRs at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marc Maun. I can give you that. I mean, on the energy side, we've actually had zero deferrals at this
point in time. And our overall deferral on the commercial side is around 3.7% with the higher level of that is in the
healthcare space. On the commercial real estate side, it's running about 8.2% of total dollars, these are dollars
outstanding. As I've looked at surveys of our peer groups, we are running on the lower end of the percentage of
dollars being deferred across all those categories to-date.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then specifically on the energy side, what's your forecast for oil prices as you're determining
this current reserve? So when you're looking out once we get past that 12-month period, where are you looking at
oil prices? And I guess maybe just going back to first quarter of 2016, the allowance was 3.1%. I guess I'm just a
little confused on how the allowance could be lower now given the broader move as well as the impact of CECL?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, a couple of comments on the price forecast. We follow the forward curve on the price deck that is published
on a regular basis. We set our price deck at the first day of each month based on the most recent changes in the
price – or the recent price deck for the five days preceding that beginning of that month. And then during the
month, we will assess whether price declines are sufficient to justify reducing that price deck during the month.
At this point in time, our price deck for April is pretty consistent with the exception of the spot price, which we don't
focus on. We focus on, first, we throw out the first month and look at the price deck beyond that, and our price
deck for April is consistent with what the price forward curve is as of this morning. So, we're still looking at it and
kind of the opening – the first year running around $28 and from there growing to about $40 by 2023.
The second part of your question was more on the reserve size for energy. Our $100 million reserves as Stacy
noted compares very favorably to our net charge off performance of the past five years. It's up $52 million for
12/31. It peaked in 2016 at $101 million. And midstream makes up a little bit bigger piece of that today which has
a little bit lower reserve allocation than it did in 2016.
At the same time we're in April and we were doing this as of March 31 based on the information we knew at that
time. I won't say that there won't be opportunities to build reserves as we move forward and watch what happens
in our market, what happens with our customers and what happens with energy prices in general.
But at the base – two or three weeks post the OPEC Plus changes, the reserve made sense based on that and
based on our history we're comfortable with it as it is today and we will evaluate it going forward and make the
appropriate reserve expectations during the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Again, a couple of things I might add there, when we peaked in our reserve for energy as a percent, it really
peaked because we had pretty dramatic energy pay downs occurring so we had over $600 million coming down
and we had the allowance, we weren't using it to the extent that we had provided for it. So that was really a kind of
a denominator effect that rose that percentage up. I think the absolute dollar amount that Marc alluded to is a
more fair comparison there from that perspective. I think Marc touched on it, but clearly trying to peg, anticipated
future losses around any of the portfolios really, but energy particularly is a very difficult thing to do and we'll
continue to evaluate over time. I think the key for us to understand is we have a extraordinarily strong mix of fee
revenue, and we have a very high level of pre-tax, pre-provision revenue such that we have the flexibility to
continue to add to the reserve at pretty material levels without ever impacting capital. And so we're well-positioned
for the future, but we will continue to evaluate as things change to ensure that our provision remains adequate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And just finally from me, on the capital last quarter, you had talked about a desire to build
capital levels. Obviously, there's been big, dramatic changes in the first quarter. But I guess how long do you feel
comfortable with an elevated total capital return ratio at this point before we, I guess, worry about maybe other
capital actions to help grow capital?

Yeah. This is Steven Nell. I'm very comfortable with the level of our Common Equity Tier 1 at that 2.98%. If you
compare that to many peers, it's well ahead. So I think we've got good capital flexibility. As I mentioned in the
comments, I don't feel like there's any threat at this point in time on our dividend. And I think we'll stay
opportunistic. I don't want to say we'll suspend today any buybacks. I want to stay opportunistic but all in the
context of that strong capital position.
So let's let some time go by here and see what occurs. I agree with Stacy's comments. We've got tremendous
pre-provision or net revenue generation. We've got good revenue diversity. So we've got plenty of strength in
terms of earnings power. We've got a very adequate reserve and a very strong capital position. So, I think we've
got good opportunity there to continue paying dividends and be opportunistic as we go forward on buybacks.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to circle back on the energy portfolio. Maybe what I think
I'm hearing you say is that based on what we know now because if I look at your downside case, it's actually
above the 12-month strip as it stands today. So, what I think I hear you saying is that with – assuming you end the
quarter near these levels and with borrowing base redeterminations going on and borrowing base is obviously
going to come down, you would expect to have another reserve build for the energy book in the second quarter. Is
that the way we should think about it, Marc?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think, we will – we have to factor in the hedging component too as part of the borrowing base
redetermination season and we have substantial hedge book. But certainly, right now, the forward curve of the
price deck that we're using is going to be based on the forward curve and it likely will bring borrowing bases down.
We've completed about 25% to-date. So, we'll take a look and see what the appropriate reserve level will be once
we get through that spring determination season.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just to round out on energy and tie it up, what is different this energy
downturn versus the 2014 to 2016 period and then the 2009 period? It would seem from the outside looking in
that E&Ps would be more at risk this go around just given constraints on liquidity and variable access to capital
outside of bank lines? So maybe if you can just give the puts and takes on what's different this time? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think the biggest thing that's different is the level of hedging. It is significant. And as we've looked at, Marc
mentioned about a quarter of these, it's been pretty impressive to see the level of hedging and how that has
helped buoy the borrowing base and we see customers making decisions that – around production, around
drilling much more quickly this time even to shut in wells at some level, much more quickly this time than we've
seen historically.
And that will have a pretty big supply effect but it will take some time for that to play through. Clearly, the demand
impact from COVID-19 is the wild card here. When does the economy begin to rebound, when do we get planes
in the air, which are large users of oil through jet fuel, when does the demand return? I think to me at this point,
this is really a demand equation less than the supply equation. I think the supply is going to come down and it's
going to come down relatively quickly.
But the wild card from my perspective is the demand question how quickly that comes back. You had demand
issues as well in the 2008/2009 price decline from the broader recession. And so, at the end of the day, you have
imbalances in supply/demand that have to be worked through.
And I think that you'll see the market do that. And it has historically done that, but it takes time, generally, 12 to 18
months for it to find some kind of equilibrium, which is why we continue to focus on that time period as opposed to
the absolute on what we see today. But we think the markets have responded appropriately, but we think the
primary risk, as we look forward here, is really around the demand impact and how quickly that can recover once
we get a resumption of some kind of business activity.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I was wondering – Steven, could you provide some color on the second quarter outlook on some of the fee
income businesses? I mean you had great quarters – quarter in brokerage and trading and mortgage. And I'm just
wondering if that level is going to be sustainable and if you could just talk about some of the other businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I can do that, Peter. Whether it's sustainable, I mean the environment is really an odd environment. So it's
hard to say. I think what I've said in the kind of limited guidance that we gave is that I do feel like the brokerage
and trading and the mortgage business will clearly be supportive and additive to revenue streams to help offset
some of the pressure that we'll feel on net interest income and net interest margin.
So, my expectation is they'll stay strong. The environment is – it's volatile. It does provide us opportunity on the
trading side to help our clients position hedges, to position their investment portfolios. Certainly, the mortgage
activity, as of today, continues to be very, very strong. We did a really nice job, I think, of improving margins in our
mortgage business, up 61 basis points, I believe and that will continue.
So I think they'll be very supportive in the second quarter as they were in, in the first quarter. Now, to what level?
I'm not – won't go there, but certainly, I think they'll be very supportive.

I might let Stacy answer on the transfer and payment businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. If you think about the payments business, I think as we go into April, we certainly saw a decline in ATM and
debit activity related to that business. We also have seen more recently a pickup in activity as those stimulus
checks have arrived. I don't think it's a dramatic slowdown, but I think it is a modest slowdown on the payment
side of the business as we look forward. That business is awfully stable in good times and bad times. But on a
relative basis, I think you'll see the impact of slower consumer spending broadly in the second quarter in our
payments business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Peter, this is Steve Bradshaw. I think on the wealth management side, we would expect to see some
improving flow there. There are some of our businesses like corporate trust that we think will grow in this current
environment. We also are seeing inflows on the equity side as we were seeing people feeling that there's – the
bottom has been reached in many cases. So we're seeing some flow out of cash into equity.

And obviously, we're seeing a lot of reposition on the fixed income side. That was a big driver in the first quarter.
Don't see anything as we sit here today that would suggest that that has abated any. So I would expect that area
to continue, to Steven's point, to be strong and to have some opportunities to grow even in this challenging
environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And then, just on the credit front, on healthcare, particularly the senior housing, I'm just wondering if you could dig
down a little bit deeper in terms of what you're seeing with the COVID impact from a credit quality standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure, Peter. This is Stacy. I'm glad to handle that. I think there's three sectors that are impacted in the healthcare
space. Hospitals, if you're a rural hospital today, if this is going to be very – it could be very devastating impact to
you. We don't have rural hospitals in our portfolio that has – particularly in our footprint where largely most of the
states have not opted into the Affordable Care Act, rural hospitals have already been under significant pressure.
And that has not been an area of business development focus for us.
The hospital systems that we have have been impacted by really multiple things, the delay of elective procedures,
which is a higher-margin business for them as well as frankly people not utilizing the facilities, in some cases,
when they need to because of fear of people being there who are COVID-positive and contracting that. Those are
very high-end hospital health systems. They have large endowments and they will be able to weather that.
We fully expect to see more liquidity needs from that health systems group as they are unlikely want to sell out of
their endowment in a depressed and securities pricing environment. So, they're going to be more likely to use
lines of credit and things like that. So we expect some increases from the portfolio, but we really don't see
material credit risk at all in that health systems group.
When we acquired CoBiz, they had a really strong and robust medical and physicians large practice group and
that is the area that we've seen the larger amount of request in healthcare for deferral request. And that's really
because these are specialty styled practices that have been impacted most by the deferral of elective procedures.
And so, our view is that we would expect that to be relatively temporary. And generally, [indiscernible] (00:59:57)
have doctors – specific doctors who are guaranteeing the facility in addition to the corporate entity. And so, there
may be some timing, there may be some classification over time as we get financial statements there. I don't see
that as a significant risk of loss today, although if we have a long period of time without access to those types of
facilities that could certainly change.
In the senior housing space, that's where certainly people have been most focused around credit risk and risk of
loss. I think that it's important to understand we have in excess of 350 skilled nursing facilities that are part of our
portfolio. We alluded in our earlier comments that we prefer multi – facility operators because of the
diversification. We have – around 5% of our skilled nursing facilities have reported at least one case of COVID,
so, in the broader scale, are relatively small.
But there is a lot of government support that will go into both the health systems and the skilled nursing in terms
of Medicare, Medicaid enhancements as well as additional funding to help with funding these enhanced controls
around infection and funds for additional purchase of protective equipment et cetera. That portfolio is holding up
20

well. It will take time. That's not a portfolio that we're going to know today what exactly the impact is. It's going to
take some time.
We're obviously having conversations with our borrowers, understanding how they're impacted and what they're
doing. But like I said, roughly 5% of the facilities in our portfolio have reported a case. So we certainly understand
that could change over time, but as things begin to stabilize, I feel pretty confident about the skilled nursing
portfolio. It won't be perfect, but I'm not – have a lot of concern there.

Well, I had a question on energy hedging. The energy market has acted so squarely this week when you saw the
price of the May forward contracts go negative. I was just wondering if that is an impact at all to the hedges that
your energy companies have. I'm not sure if they use the forward contracts to hedge and there is basis risk there,
those hedges not worked in the way that they're supposed to or if they hedge via some other means.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. I mean that's part of the noise that comes around everybody watching the spot price. If we had
been able to do that, I think everybody in Texas and Oklahoma would have filled up their swimming pools with oil
to be able to get paid to do that. The borrowers really – the hedging works on kind of on daily average basis for
the 20 trading days prior to closing the contract. So, that anomaly around we saw with the closing of the May
contract was really not particularly impactful to the hedging and certainly creates noise and a lot of headlines, but
is not meaningful to the actual settlement of these hedges.

Okay. And then, on the expense side, you had a decent step-down in the compensation expenses. I've heard you
say some of that is related to incentive comp, but I mean fees did really well and comp went down. Normally,
those kind of move together, but maybe just help size it out. As we look to the second quarter, how do you think
that comp line will trend? Is 1Q a good run rate or how much of that was kind of a one-time in nature benefit from

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brady. This is Steven. I would say roughly $8 million of that step-down was related to deferred
compensation that runs through that line item and I would not expect that to recur. So, that's a reduction in the
first quarter that won't recur. But everything else, I think, is pretty good. We look – we stepped down a little bit on
our personnel, our regular and part-time salaries. I think that will continue with some of the efforts that we're
taking on as the staff and certainly open positions and replacement of positions slowing some of our project cost
and down a little bit. So I think with regard to looking forward, that one item of about $8 million would be
something that I would consider not to recur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Then, lastly for me, just on the net interest margin, Steven, you're saying we're not going to see the full
impact until the second quarter. Any idea of the magnitude of how much the margin could decline in 2Q? I mean
1Q was down I think 7 basis points or 8 basis points. How much do you think it could be down in 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think there's too many moving parts. I mean you've got significant advances on your loan book, partially
related to COVID. You've got PPP loans that are on the balance sheet now. You've got funding costs related to
that. You've got significant inflows of deposits. It's impossible to tell you the exact magnitude of what the NIM will
look like. But I'll tell you and I'll reiterate what Stacy said earlier, the biggest thing that we can do is really control
our deposit costs.
And we are working very, very hard. He gave you an example of about $4 billion of exception price deposits that
we have moved down significantly. I think our March interest-bearing deposit cost was 79 basis points and I
expect that to migrate significantly lower over the coming quarters. So that's going to be a nice benefit to help
support net interest margin.
But clearly, with the decline in – the huge decline in rates that we saw in kind of early to mid-part of March is
going to have an impact on NIM. And there's just a lot of moving parts to consider. So I'm not going to step out
and say it's going to be X number of basis points, but it will be lower than the 2.80% that you saw in the first
quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning. Back to the energy loans, could you help us frame just one comparison that investors may be
looking at and that is that, yesterday, Comerica reported and noted that their energy reserve today is about 10%
versus your 2.4%, 2.5%? So can you frame that up for us? And also, could you just talk about how you stress
tested the energy book specifically in terms of a longer duration for this lower oil demand? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Jennifer, this is Marc Maun. Let me touch on framing it against Comerica. And to be honest, I don't know their
portfolio. So, can't really assess how they're coming up with their particular numbers. But I will say that in the
2015 to 2017 downturn, we saw a number of banks that stepped out with significant energy reserves, early in the
process, we tended to be at the lower end with some other banks that are very active in the energy space.
We base our energy reserve on what we're looking at in terms of our portfolios' characteristics are based on what
we can assess from the structure of their engineering. We have 16 engineers and techs on staff. So, we feel we
are doing a very strong analysis of what the – not only what the price deck impacts are, but understanding exactly
how the well production and performance of those wells will be completed as part of that engineering process.
And then, we also come back continually to the hedging concept is that that has a price protection that helps us
not just look at what the current price deck is.
So we think we take all of those things together and we evaluate based on our past history too, we've been
consistent that we've had sufficient reserve, more than sufficient reserves [ph] throughout (01:09:31) cycles in
energy to cover our ultimate losses and we will continue, as we said, before to evaluate on an ongoing basis to
see that we have the appropriate reserve.
With regards to the stress test, we tend to run at about 20%, as I said earlier, a discount to our existing price
deck, which, in the crude oil side, ran it from [ph] 23% (01:09:58) early in 2020 up to kind of topping out around
[ph] 33% (01:10:05) or a little plus on that and then natural gas at $1.52 growing to about $1.92 over a five-year
period. That stress test is done on – without hedging basis.
As I said earlier, right now, that stress test is still reflective of what the forward curve is. It's well below what the –
it's still at the 20% below roughly of where the forward curve is today. And so, we take a look at that, take a look
at the hedging that's associated with the individual customers, determine where our highest risks are. We had a
very small number of customers that continue to not have sufficient hedging and those are the ones we've
identified. The rest we had already identified as criticized loans and we're working with.
So, [ph] it wasn't a (01:10:54) substantial increase in the number of customers that we think are higher risk and
that's how we looked at the stress test.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
And I won't speak to a specific other entity, but just broadly speaking, we are in the control seat for 69% of our
energy relationships whether as the lead, as the syndicating agent, as the – maybe it's a single bank facility. But I
think that really helps us as we work through this to kind of help navigate and work through any issues that may
come up in this environment.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. That's all very helpful. When you pointed out the more pandemic-sensitive industries, casinos,
restaurants, hotels, et cetera, what kind of deferral rate are you seeing among industries from that [ph] slide
(01:11:50)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Actually I don't know that I have a specific for that broken down by industry. I go back to the fact that our – almost
all of those are in our C&I portfolio. We're running about 3.8% total dollars. I know that we have had some deferral
requests on the casinos, because they are completely shut down. However, those are mostly tribal casinos,
almost all of them, which have pretty substantial liquidity reserves and in a lot of cases are maintaining their
employment. And that is one of the reasons that they're asking for modifications.
We really haven't had any to speak of of significance in the convenience stores, specialty stores, hotels, the
colleges and universities or airlines. Yet, the restaurant side, we have seen some that is – a sizable portion of that
is franchisee finance. However, we're with very large brands, very well-known brands. And so, while we're hearing
sales are down 20% to 30%, we know that they're still able to do drive-thru and curbside and delivery. And the
brand names are being supported by the franchisor in a lot of cases to provide longer-term support should this
carry out farther.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
And as you know, Jennifer, these types of areas are ones that we've materially underweighted over a very long
period of time at BOK Financial. These types of businesses have a harder time sustaining through a downturn.
And so, we have historically not been a significant lender in this space.
The other area that we have been underweighted in significantly is any kind of leverage lending. Marc and his
credit team have done a really good job managing through that where we have a large level of kind of cash flow
only as our source of repayment. So we feel pretty good as it relates to those more high risk segments of the
spectrum.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Can you talk about just the unique aspects of that casino portfolio, the Indian casino portfolio and how
severe the losses could be and how recourse works for those types of credits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I mean I'll talk about the way they're structured. I mean they are direct. [ph] They're to the (01:14:40) casino
operations of the individual tribes. We generally, as you know, cannot take mortgages on casinos because of the
sovereign nation status. But all the nations have waived sovereign immunity on this and the way recourse would
work is we take over the cash flow associated with the casino.
As I said, these casinos are shut down for now. However, they have strong liquidity and have substantial cash
balances. So we don't see significant risk of loss as we would expect when the economy reopens that these
facilities will reopen as well. It's hard to assess. It depends, again, how long before they reopen. We're
24

comfortable that they've got cash reserves on the most – on the large – vast majority of this portfolio that will
support it through a reasonable closure period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Jennifer, an interesting side note on that is the stimulus payments began to roll out. We saw a large uptick in our
gaming segment of our debit card as well. So it's hard to assess. There's going to be some offsets there. These
are very strong gaming operations and tribes that are behind them. So it should be a very good portfolio.

Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks so much.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Olney with Stephens. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the discussion around energy hedges. And once we move
beyond that 12 months' timeframe, can you give us an idea or just some more clarity on how much that hedge
production declines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marc. We have about – our customer base – about a third of our oil weighted customers have more
than hit 50% of their average price – their portfolio hedged at an average price of $52 ended through 2021. And
the gas is about a little bit larger, more like 36% hedged at an average price at [ph] $2.63 (01:17:08).
What I would note is that, we are still seeing people increasing their hedging activity into 2021 based on the curve
price, especially a couple of weeks ago when you were still looking at $40 plus oil in 2021. So we would anticipate
that hedge activity will start increasing over the latter half of this year as well into that 2021 year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
And in fact over the last couple weeks, we have seen significant hedging that's not reflected in these numbers.
You can hedge 2021 at $33 a barrel as of 8 O'clock AM this morning, 2022 at $36 a barrel. So there's still ample
opportunity for hedges to be layered in. A lot of these companies will have maybe 18-month rolling hedge
programs and things like that. So I think the 2021 number will continue to improve over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And I think one thing I should add is that this kind of price levels, we don't need a return to $50 or even $40 level
to see improved cash flow significantly for these companies in an environment where they're discontinuing their
drilling activity.
25


BOK Financial Corp.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
If we see a couple dollar increase because of their operating expense leverage in this kind of environment, they
will have a dramatic increase in their overall cash flow and significantly reduce the potential risk of loss associated
with these particular loans in this portfolio. That is because they're not having the expense of trying to use existing
production to support CapEx expense.
Now, that would change if drilling increased, but at this point in time, given the current environment, we don't
anticipate any significant drilling activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And can you talk more about counterparty risk within the hedges? Are these hedges going
through be okay or someone else? Just trying to figure out what entity is holding the wrong end of that hedge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, a lot of them are done through an exchange. So you've got the exchange counterparties in hold post margin
and the credit risk on that exchange is really very small. We have some number of hedges that are done with
single counterparties who were high investment grade rated, but with very low credit lines bilaterally. And so,
there's cash exchanged on a daily basis to settle any differences between the credit line provided and the
changes in the price during that period of time.
So, there is a modest amount of counterparty risk there, but it is very slight at this point. Much, much different
than it was in the 2008/2009 time period, where most of this trading was done with single counterparties at credit
limits much higher than what we use today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. That's helpful, Stacy. That's all for me. Thank you, guys.

Please proceed with your question.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks, guys. Good morning. Had a couple of questions. First is, on the retail commercial real estate portfolio,
that $775 million, you highlighted about $605 million of that on that COVID-19 impact slide. Can you tell us the
areas maybe that you did not include on that slide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I'll let Stacy talk to you on the CRE, but I want to be clear that COVID-19 slide, that retail is in our C&I
portfolio. That is not part of the CRE retail portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
[ph] Is that part of the (01:21:15) retail trade portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
And the retail CRE portfolio is very well-positioned. I alluded to kind of that average debt service coverage we had
at the end of 2019 for that portfolio. What I failed to mention was that 1.5 times was based on kind of a stress that
we do at this case [ph] 6.25% rate on a 25-year RAM (01:21:42). So actual debt service will be much lower –
much better than that, but we look at it on a kind of to try to normalize rates and things like that and as we look at
that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And so, since you mentioned that, that retail piece is from that wholesale and retail trade portfolio, is the
other $1.4 billion of that $2 billion segment, is that all wholesale trade or is there other retail segments of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No. The $605 million is the full amount of our retail exposure. The rest of it would be in the wholesale side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then, I'd just ask one more question on the energy front. I'm trying to square the dynamics
we saw in the E&P space last year, where crude was over $50 for the majority of the year and we still had
growing levels of bankruptcies. So, this year and looking forward, even with a portion of the production hedged at
$52, obviously the unhedged portion brings down kind of the weighted average price per barrel that the producers
would be getting. And then, if you hedged going forward in the $30 or low-30s over the next couple years, that
would seem to still generate a lot more vulnerability for the reserve base producers or the borrowers relative to
where we saw the commodity price last year. Can you help me spur that again?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Yeah. I think the piece that you're missing is total debt. So the common denominator in the increase in
bankruptcies is largely unsecured capital market style debt that they can't roll or refinance, not nearly as much on
the senior secured lending related to the revolver. We've got borrowers who are in or contemplating bankruptcy
who we would expect to be able to leave on accrual because the issue is not the bank debt, the issue is the
unsecured bond debt or debt outside of the bank facility that they can't refinance or repay.
And so, you're having a restructure that happens around those bondholders becoming the equity holder and
having to go through a bankruptcy process to do that. I think that's the link that in your analysis is not as prevalent
as probably it should be.
