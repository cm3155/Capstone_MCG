Thank you, Raquel. Welcome and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our second-quarter results which were released before the market opened this morning. The earnings
release and investor presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
Second-quarter performance was outstanding as we continue to build upon the momentum generated by
remaining open and externally focused over the past 17 months. Excluding PPP, our teams generated record
quarterly loan production, exceeding $600 million for the first time in our history and shattering the previous record
set in the fourth quarter of last year. Moreover, deposit inflows remained robust and well above our expectations.
Our Financial Services Group and Trust Company are having a breakout year, and credit quality is exceptional.
Making a great quarter even better, we announced our entrance into the Northern California market with the
signing of a definitive merger agreement with Sacramento-based Bank of Commerce Holdings.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Our success this quarter was due to the forward focus of all of our employees. Throughout the pandemic, we
remained safely open and available to existing and prospective clients. Our bankers continue to cultivate
relationships and win new business by deploying their solutions-based approach to meeting individual client
needs, and the benefits of their efforts over the past year are evident in our year-to-date balance sheet growth
and earnings performance.
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the line and
take your questions. As a reminder, we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further
information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release, our website or our SEC
filings.
This time, I'll turn the call over to Aaron.

Thank you, Clint, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, Columbia generated net income of $55 million
or $0.77 per share. Adjusted for $510,000 of acquisition-related costs, pre-tax pre-provision income of $66.3
million was one of our best quarters on record. This strong performance was driven by solid fundamentals.
Earning assets increased, our cost of deposits remained among the best in the industry, and noninterest income
was again a solid contributor. Total deposits increased by $578 million or 16% annualized during the quarter to
$15.3 billion at June 30. Our cost of deposits held steady at just 4 basis points.
Total loans increased modestly to $9.7 billion at June 30. Net of PPP, our loan balance has increased by $219
million or 10% annualized and surpassed $9 billion for the first time in our history. The increase was driven by
record production. During the quarter, we originated $657 million of new loans which includes $52 million of PPP
loans. New loan production, excluding PPP, was brought on at an average tax-adjusted coupon rate of 3.14%
which compares to the overall portfolio rate, also excluding PPP, of 3.90%.
Our investment securities portfolio was $6.2 billion as of June 30, which was a linked quarter increase of $718
million driven by $942 million of purchases. During the quarter, we transferred securities with a fair value of $2
billion from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification. Because the intent was to
hold these investments to maturity, the securities are no longer subject to valuation adjustments connected to
interest rate changes, and that should reduce the related volatility in equity and book value.
The net interest margin decreased 15 basis points linked quarter to 3.16%, while our net interest income
increased by $1.5 million linked quarter as we deployed more of our deposit growth into loans and investment
securities. The deposit inflows and larger investment portfolio were key factors behind the margin pressure in the
quarter as higher securities balances and lower yields on those balances together contributed 10 basis points to
the margin decline. The remaining decline is primarily due to a reduction in loan yields, mostly due to a drop in
amortized fees from the PPP portfolio but also from lower coupon rates on new loans.
Noninterest income was down slightly on a linked-quarter basis to $22.7 million. The drop was centered in loan
revenue stemming from lower mortgage banking income, but most of that pressure [ph] was also by strength
(00:05:32) in other business lines. Notably, card revenues, mostly driven by interchange fees, increased by $1
million while financial services and trust revenue rose by $864,000, and deposit and treasury management fees
increased by $343,000. Noninterest expense of $84.1 million included professional services cost of $510,000

related to the pending Merchants Bank of Commerce transaction. Excluding these acquisition costs, noninterest
expense of $83.6 million was essentially flat when compared to the first quarter.
Compensation and benefit costs increased in the quarter mostly due to higher capitalized loan origination costs in
the first quarter when compared to the second quarter. That said, even in the second quarter, we continued to
benefit from a high level of capitalized loan origination expense. Meanwhile, the other expense line decreased
linked quarter due to $1.3 million of less provision for unfunded commitments. Lastly, the provision for income
taxes increased $2 million on a linked-quarter basis to $14.5 million, representing a 20.9% effective rate. We
continue to expect our 2021 tax rate to remain in the range of 19% to 21%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher M. Merrywell
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Throughout the economic turbulence of the past 17 months, we
have focused on what we can control in order to take care of our employees, clients, and communities. We
continue to invest in our people, relationship training, and banking systems. Our bankers have responded by
keeping the pipeline full and providing custom solutions to meet the needs of existing and new clients. Following
this business-as-usual mindset positioned us to capitalize on high-quality credits and win new business during the
quarter.
While still in the background during the second quarter, the pandemic is no longer the lead story. The bank
continued to originate PPP loans through the program's end on May 4. And in the final tally for both rounds of
PPP, approximately 9,300 loans were originated, which infused over $1.5 billion into the Pacific Northwest
economy. Forgiveness for both rounds is now underway as the Round 2 platform opened for our clients on July 7.
Net of unearned income, PPP loans were $692 million at the end of the second quarter. We have received over
$820 million of payoffs and pay-downs related to Round 1 of the program. And we have received over 2,000
applications for forgiveness of Round 2 loans since the portal opened. As Clint noted, excluding Round 2 PPP
loans, we achieved a new loan production record of $605 million, which was notably higher than the prior quarter
record of $468 million set during the fourth quarter of 2020. Production was especially strong in CRE and C&I was
diversified with good growth in real estate lending and leasing, healthcare, construction, and the agriculture
sectors. Line utilization was flat at 44.6%, but we saw absolute dollar increases in C&I and construction lines.
Excluding PPP, the quarterly production mix was 58% fixed, 34% floating, and 8% variable. The composition of
the loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged and the overall portfolio mix is now 7% PPP loans, 49% non-
PPP fixed, 33% floating, and 11% variable. As was mentioned, deposits grew by $578 million during the quarter
and by over $2 billion over the past 12 months. The quarterly inflows were split between noninterest and interest-
bearing with the majority from business customers. Over half of the increase is from new accounts with the
remainder attributed to delayed spending and investment by existing business clients and consumers.
Approximately 60% of the quarterly increase came from our Puget Sound region with approximately 35% from
Oregon and the Columbia Gorge clients. The deposit mix increased slightly to 61% business and 39% consumer.
We continue to drive exception rates down maintaining our industry-leading cost of deposits. Although residential
mortgage activity slowed on a linked-quarter basis, other fee income categories were up during the quarter as we
benefit from our relationship focus and higher quality referrals. CB Financial Services and Columbia Trust
Company have both had a tremendous year, achieving record revenues in assets under management. Card
revenues was up $1 million on a linked-quarter basis and deposit service fees increased by $343,000.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
As part of our ongoing branch rationalization process, we recently announced the consolidation of three branches
scheduled to occur during September and October of this year. We are continually optimizing our delivery
strategy and have been proactive in consolidating branches over the past decade, expanding each branch of
service coverage area given local market conditions and projected growth.
Continuing to expand our delivery strategy, on July 12 we relocated our Tigard, Oregon branch and opened a new
financial hub. It joins our Ballard and Boise NeighborHubs, which are specifically designed to support a
relationship-based approach to helping our clients achieve their financial goals.
Now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.

Andrew L. McDonald
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Chris.
This quarter's allowance for credit losses totaled $143 million, a reduction of $5.3 million from last quarter. Net
recoveries of about $200,000 led to a provision release of $5.5 million for the quarter. It should also be noted that
the release from the provision was muted by over $215 million in loan growth, net of PPP during the quarter. Our
IHS market economic forecast assumes full-year GDP growth of 6.7% for 2021 and 4.7% for 2022 with the
unemployment rate predicted to end 2021 at 4.2% and in 2022 close to pre-pandemic levels. This forecast is an
improvement over last quarter when GDP was forecasted at 5.7% for 2021. The improved forecast is
counterbalanced by the continued stress in our loan portfolio as borrowers continue to be impacted by the
lingering effects of the pandemic and related lockdowns. As such, we continue to apply an overlay for what we
consider high-risk commercial real estate and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a
significant Northwest employer.
These amounted to a combined $10 million in Q2 reserves, a decrease from $11.7 million in Q1. Our adjustment
is driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic affecting hospitality, shifting dynamics in office and retail, and
business closures and labor challenges in the restaurant industry. We ended the quarter with an allowance
relative to period-end loans of 1.48%. Adjusting for PPP loans, the allowance to period-end loans increases to
1.59%.
NPAs for the quarter improved to 14 basis points. The decline in NPAs is principally due to pay-downs and
payoffs with a modest amount returning to accrual status. Most of our remaining NPAs are assets that have
gained to this classification due to reasons not related to the pandemic. However, with that said, the pandemic
has, in some cases, impacted the business' ability to rebound. Nevertheless, at 14 basis points, NPAs are very
manageable at this point.
Past due loans for the quarter were 17 basis points compared to 11 basis points last quarter. Net charge-offs, as
noted earlier, posted a small recovery of about $200,000. Problem loans, which we define as loans rated watch or
worse, declined from $920 million last quarter to $804 million as of June 30, 2021. When compared to a year ago
when problem loans were about $1.1 billion, you can see there has been a meaningful amount of healing within
the portfolio. This is principally within the hospitality, transportation, food and beverage, and retail portfolios.
Okay. Deferrals. At the close of the quarter, we had $40 million in active deferrals or less than 1% of our portfolio
excluding PPP loans. This is of course very different from this time last year when we had $1.6 billion. The
majority of these deferrals are roughly 75% are on their first deferral. It can be found in our hospitality and

restaurant portfolios along with some [ph] urban parking lots (00:15:38). Deferrals for the most part continue to
run off as expected.
We continue to classify our retail, hospitality, restaurant, and aviation portfolios as portfolio subject to an elevated
level of risk due to the pandemic. In aggregate these portfolios account for about $1.2 billion in loans or 13% of
our loan portfolio. Retail is the largest segment at $572 million in loans outstanding at the end of the quarter.
While we remain concerned over the pandemic's impact on this portfolio, problem loans are actually down year-
over-year as well as from last quarter. In fact, this portfolio has now exhibited improving credit trends for four
consecutive quarters, and problem loans are half of what they were a year ago.
We had no past dues in this segment, nonaccruals were only 4 basis points, and no retail loans were on deferral
as of June 30. As mentioned before, PPP loans have certainly made a difference for our borrowers in this
portfolio. While these statistics are all positive, we continue to be cautious here given the colloquial evidence we
see in our footprint along with conditions seen in the labor markets.
Hospitality, at $331 million, has shown a mixed bag of results. In total, problem loans in this segment declined
during the quarter and now represent about 53% of the portfolio, down from 70% a year ago.
As discussed last quarter, there is clearly a bifurcation in the portfolio between leisure-oriented and business-
oriented properties. Leisure accounts for about 69% of our portfolio while business accounts for 31%. Leisure
properties have weathered the pandemic much better than our original expectations. While business-oriented
properties, which make up most of the substandard assets in this portfolio, are taking longer to recover. About half
of hospitality's portfolio's $169 million of problem loans are substandard or roughly $89 million. It does appear that
this level of classification in substandard hospitality loans has leveled off. For most of these hotel properties rated
substandard, we have put into place long-term action plans to help get our customers through to recovery.
Restaurants, which account for about $217 million, remained consistent this past quarter. Problem loans were
stable at roughly 22% of the portfolio. We had about $2.6 million in deferrals in this portfolio at quarter end.
Similar to the bank in general, deferrals this time last year amounted to $66 million, so a dramatic reduction year-
over-year. Again, PPP loans have had a meaningful impact for restaurant operators.
As of June 30th, 100% of our restaurant operators were cleared to open at 100% occupancy, which of course is
great news. However, the new issue affecting these operators is finding enough employees to support 100%
occupancy. So, it's a good news/bad news scenario for restaurant operators.
Finally, the aviation portfolio had roughly $117 million, down by about $32 million from a year ago, was stable
during the quarter. As in past quarters, no loans were past due, all customers continue to pay as agreed, and no
loans were on deferral. This industry will take time to recover mostly due to business travel, which, as of yet, has
not rebounded as dramatically as leisure travel.
There is a lot of pent-up demand on the leisure side as seen by the TSA traffic with July traffic averaging 80%
[indiscernible] (00:19:51) 2019 levels. Grandparents are excited to go visit their grandchildren, and many families
are finally taking that long awaited trip to Hawaii. However, headwinds continue with low demand for business
travel, as noted before, and an unequal global recovery. Despite the slow recovery due to these continued
headwinds, many US airlines are projecting a return to positive cash flow within the next few quarters and have
begun using their liquidity to retire debt and deleverage their balance sheets.
I will now hand the call back over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Andy.
We're excited to have Bank of Commerce Holdings join the Columbia family and are still on target for our fourth
quarter close. Randy Eslick and his team have been working closely with their Columbia counterparts to ensure a
seamless closing and integration of the merger. The partnership will bring together two community-focused banks
with complementary business models and cultures.
This morning we announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.28. This quarter's dividend will be paid on August
25 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 11.
This concludes our prepared comments. As a reminder, Andy, Chris, and Aaron are with me to answer your
questions. And now, Raquel, we will open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Very strong production this quarter, and wanted to get a better sense of the type of commercial real estate
production that you're doing assuming that retail, office, hospitality are still areas of some concern in terms of new
business. Just want to get a sense for what drove that commercial real estate piece of production.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, just a sec. Let me get it in front of me. I have too much paper. So, while Andy finds the detailed map, I'll just
speak in general in terms of the record production for the quarter. And as I noted in my opening comments, it was
– far surpassed the record, previous record set in the fourth quarter of last year. And so, that's just a continuation
of what we saw at the end of the third quarter of last year going into the fourth quarter. And that momentum
continued to build in terms of pipeline activity. And what we're seeing just broadly is even though there's a lot of
liquidity still out there in the market, it's a very competitive atmosphere. We're taking market share [ph] in some
longtime (00:23:18) clients. And that's what you saw that really drove that record production during the quarter.
I think Andy has the detail that will respond to your question.

Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. So, most of the growth is actually an owner-occupied CRE. And it's a combination of owner-occupied office
warehouse and warehouse-type properties. And then we've also done a little bit in the retail space, but that's
pretty modest at $4 million. So, it's predominantly owner-occupied.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then how does the pipeline compare to last quarter coming out of 2Q? Given the production, is it –
pipeline, is it down and you feel like you need to kind of backfill or I'm just trying to get a sense for the change on
a percentage basis from last quarter or even year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure, Matt. And as expected, you would expect that after a record quarter at those levels that the pipeline would
pull back some. We're very pleased with where it's at and our bankers continue to prospect, win new deals. And
we're holding on to a lot of our existing loans on the books as well. So, yeah, it's retreated a little but in historic, if
you look at it historically, we're very pleased at the level that it's at and it should lead to growth for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just on the new coupons at [ph] 3.14% (00:25:04), that's down pretty materially from last quarter I
think at [ph] 3.90% (00:25:08) ex-PPP. I guess, how much of that was related to the mix and then how much of
that might be related to just be more competitive on price?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I'll take a start on that, and then Aaron can comment on maybe some more details. It does have to do
mostly with the mix. During the quarter we had the opportunity to participate in some municipal deals that drove
some larger balances. Those are highly competitive RFPs. Our approach, our expertise in that space allowed us
to win those deals. But those high-quality credits certainly come along at a lower coupon, and that skewed the
number for the quarter. And I think past that, we see a more of a return to leveled out numbers and improving
numbers.
And, Aaron, is there anything you'd like to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I'd just add in, Matt, that the loan yields during the quarter, excluding PPP, was [ph] 4.26%, and that compares to
4.28% (00:26:13) in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. And then just on – I know it's a small piece of the revenue pie, but on the mortgage, the weaker
mortgage gain on sale and I think it's embedded in your loan revenue fee line. Can you give us a sense for how
much in the way of loans were sold in the specific gain this quarter versus last?

Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, Matt, I'm not sure we're going to provide the specifics on that. But, generally speaking, the volume of sales as
well as the gain on sale is not materially different from quarter-to-quarter. What changed was the pipeline and the
value of the pipeline. So, that was really what drove the decline sequentially. So, it's more of the volume of activity
in the business versus the gain on sale amount that drove the change.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Question on the – just trying to ball together the margin and your securities investments. I guess if you could kind
of offer any thoughts on go-forward, what you think you'd do with that earning asset balance as well as kind of
stabilizing the margin. And I know the goal is [ph] spread income (00:27:54) dollars, but just the interplay and
anything you could kind of point to what you think back half. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The margin is going to continue to be a bit of a challenge. I mean, there's a lot of factors at play. As you noted, we
have had a very significant increase in investment securities balances during the quarter, and the balances that
did come on came on at lower yields. Ultimately, to see that the margin kind of rebound is going to take either
improvements in the rate environments or a significant shift back toward loans.
So, I think over the next couple of quarters, you're going to have the noise of PPP continuing to add that. We still
have $700 million of PPP loans on the balance sheet. My expectation, as I said, much of that will be forgiven over
this quarter and next. And so, that will continue to drive some of the fee income on that and benefit the margin.
Underlying that, you're going to see the full quarter impacts of the changes that I just discussed with respect to the
securities portfolio and lower yields on both the securities as well as on the loan portfolio. So, there's going to be
some fundamental pressure there that continues. That said, I do think that we're getting closer to where I would
expect that to bottom out. And obviously, I'm very hopeful that we get some improvement in the rate environment.
The rates this quarter were not ideal. Not only did we see the [ph] 10-year (00:29:50) come in quite a bit, but the
flattening was not ideal.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Encouragingly though, some of the more recent forecasts that I've seen for rates are more suggestive that we
could see a good lift by the end of the year. So, hopefully, the operating environment in terms of rates show some
improvement from here. And then, with the worst of the kind of balance sheet pressures kind of working through
the system, my expectation is that the core margin is closer to a bottoming than not, but we probably still have a
little further to go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And I'll just add on to that that to me the wildcard around the margin is what happens with deposit growth. And
that's really created the liquidity and the shift into, I guess, the earning asset mix shift. And, as you know, Jeff ,
from all the years you followed us that in a normal environment virtually all of our deposit growth comes in the
second half of the year. And we had another $1.5 billion in the first half of this year of deposit growth. So, it
certainly impacts the margin calculation. And I know that's an important component of your modeling, but we're
still at 4 basis points for cost of funds.
And so, where I'm really focused and the team is really focused is making sure that we're growing net interest
income. And I think that if we should continue to have strong deposit growth while we'll push the loan-to-deposit
ratio down, and perhaps grow in the short-term the size of the securities book, it should result in increased
revenue for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. I appreciate the commentary. Maybe one other, just a different angle. On the expense line, you kind of
noted some of the PPP impact there, but that's a pretty low number. You guys had talked about a mid to upper
80s kind of run rate. Can we adjust that lower? Is it squarely kind of mid-80s if we came in a bit? I'm just trying to
sense if that's come in or if there's significant investment in the second half we should look for?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff. I guess, I'm just inclined to guide you lower at this point. That said, I commend the team for doing a
great job controlling expenses. And as Chris noted, we're going to be doing a little bit consolidation here in the
back half that'll help some. But the [ph] FAS-91 (00:32:49) in the second quarter were still pretty strong. There's
probably a couple million of that. And I would expect that that's going to have much less of a beneficial impact on
our expenses in the third quarter. And then we've also got some project costs that I'm expecting are probably
going to hit our data processing and software line in the third quarter.
So, at this point, I think that the prior guidance still stands particularly as we're seeing a lot more of our folks get
out. And while they've been active with clients throughout, I think we're starting to see a little bit more travel and
entertainment kind of expenses. And so, that's going to probably [ph] push that up, too (00:33:36). But we're
certainly being very mindful of holding those costs in check.

Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sorry, I unmute myself. Hi, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Hi, Jackie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of context for where my question is coming from. So, I apologize if this is a little
bit wordy, but I want to make sure I make it clear what I'm asking. This is one of the – one of the [ph] lesser
quarters (00:34:12) that I've had. And looking through other earnings releases, I really think that I've been asking
the wrong question. And so, I have the opportunity to actually ask the right one, which is I feel like I've been really
focused on line utilization when what I should be focused on is actual line draws. And you had, if I did my math
right, excluding PPP, you had balanced growth in the commercial business portfolio. And so, I want to see where
that's coming from. If you have a sense whether it's from customers that are actually out there and spending more
or whether it's some of the new generation that you were talking about, and just kind of how you think of the
momentum going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That's absolutely the right way to think about it because – especially if you're looking at year-over-year or even on
linked-quarter as our bankers are out there originating new commitments and new balances on those
commitments that it can skew that utilization ratio. I'm looking at – the line utilization number itself does not
change from quarter-to-quarter. But you're right to be thinking about the draws have increased just as the
commitments have increased.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think – yeah, I mean, you have some context for that change, because I think what you're really trying to
figure out is how much of those roughly $200 million of growth came from growth in new outstanding lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Just wondering – my thesis, and I don't know if this is going to play out or not, is that though we're not seeing
line utilization change, that's because you're adding new customers, which is drawing the commitment level up.
And so, it's masking the benefit of some of the drawers that you are seeing. Does that sound fair?

Jackie, I think that's a fair question and apologize for not having that right at the tip of our fingers. I'd be happy to
talk...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, I know it's really a nuance. Sorry to put you on the spot like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No worries. We'll see if in our information here we do have it. And you can either get back if you have another
question or we'll get back to you afterwards certainly. It's a great question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
...and the new balances, the new clients that are coming on are certainly transferring line balances. And it does
mask the overall aspect of it. So, yeah, it's an excellent question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And that – I mean, your comments right there, Chris, kind of gets to the heart of what I'm looking at which is
more just the general momentum that you're seeing more so than an actual dollar figure.
And then the second thing I wanted to ask is just related to construction, I know demand is high in the market, but
obviously there are constraints relating to supply chains and just availability of land and inventory and everything.
And so, I'm wondering what you're seeing in that market in terms of growth potential and how projects are moving
along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. So, referring more to our Builder Banking group, they're having a fantastic year. Builders are still – they
have inventory. They're finding – projects are delayed and taking longer, they're getting through to the end. Sales
up into the second quarter were very strong. I think the biggest challenge for us, when you look at that segment,
is houses are selling so quickly that they're not staying around on our books. So, the churn of it is pretty robust.
Now, we're going to move into a season where house sales tend to slow down and things of that nature may give
us a little bit of a lift there. But, to-date, it's been extremely quick other than the delays from the supply chain.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Maybe just back to the question on deposits. You're expecting similar second half deposit growth to maybe what
we see historically. In other words, are you seeing some normalization developing in deposit flows or do we still
have some of the accesses out there in the market in terms of money flowing in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Wow, that's a forward-looking question that I'd love to have an exact answer for. But, historically, yes, you've seen
that. I think that it remains to be seen, and there's still a lot of liquidity in the system. We've talked in previous
quarters about what's it going to take for that liquidity to exit the system. All things being equal, I think I can't
pinpoint that we'll be at the same exact levels, but there is a lot of economic activity. Money is changing hands,
and I would expect that our client base will continue to behave as they have.
With that said and I think one of the variables could be new client acquisition and what continues to come on in
that space, which may be an offset to – if normal activity is not there, we may see a pickup in that which would
then offset it. So, all that around, I would say, yeah, I would think it's going to be fairly normal, but the components
of it may be different.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I mean, there's one other variable that comes into play, and that's what we do through our CB Financial Services
group. And that's something that, as clients begin to maybe look for returns above what we're paying on bank
deposit rates, then we see some activity, and we've seen that in pre-pandemic, it was several hundred million
dollars bank for a couple of quarters that move off our balance sheet into assets under management with our
financial services group.
So, we still drive positive economics from that. And you can see some of that activity still occurring today, and you
see that with that upward trajectory in terms of the fee income that we're driving from that group. So, that's
something that, as we progress through the third quarter or fourth quarter, if that's a significant driver of net
deposit balances, then we'll certainly highlight that for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That was another question I had, so I can scratch it off my list. So, I appreciate that. Andy, question for you.
One of your quotes on the release is things are very strong and you appreciate all the puts and takes in terms of
the reserve and provision. But what does it take, what more does it take to keep bringing the reserve down? Is it
economic improvement that does it? Is it changing of your factors? And I guess I'm just trying to get a bit of a
forward look because of some of these negative provisions that we've seen in the last couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Right. Well, for Columbia, we still have $400 million plus in substandard loans. And so, we need to continue to
work through and help those borrowers recover. And that will have a meaningful impact on our level allowance for
credit losses. I think as the economy stabilizes and we do not see dramatic changes in economic forecasts, the
economic forecast will be less of a driver and more traditional levels of the problem loans, charge-offs, and those
kinds of activities will be driving the provision.
Does that answer your question? I mean, I trying to be I guess a little bit more specific to COLB.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, that does help I guess. From an outsider's point of view, I still see the reserve levels as relatively high
particularly relative to your NPAs. So, I just kind of wanted to get a flavor for what we should expect in terms of
the quarterly impact on the P&L?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Last question maybe for you, Clint. Just on this loan production and growth numbers that you've
been seeing. It feels like something is different in your model in a positive way. And you guys always highlight
expenses to average assets. And we've touched a little bit on expected deposit growth, so that brings up assets

as well. But I'm just curious what kind of capacity you feel like you have to add assets without a lot of hiring and
spending? Another way is what kind of leverage do you have in your business model and is it different than a
couple of years ago?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, what – do you want to repeat it just to make sure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I'm just curious about the operating leverage in your business because I'm looking at – the loan production is
going up. And you always highlight the operating leverage piece of the business. And I'm just curious if – is the
business model a little bit different, meaning you have the capacity to add assets without hiring a lot of new
lenders? And is there the potential for longer-term improvement in operating leverage based on some of the
changes you made over the last couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The short answer is yes to both of those, but it's more nuanced in terms of internal capacity and, in
particular, in our ability to handle additional loan volume; is something that we've worked on for the past several
years. And even with the things that we've discussed over the past year where we – when we say that our
bankers remained externally focused, and we continued throughout the pandemic in a near-normal operating
capacity, well, that also included moving forward on internal initiatives in the back office, process improvement,
increased automation, and all of those types of activities, as well as just the collaboration amongst our various
teams and groups in getting the right banker in front of the client. And that's resulted in relationships on both sides
of the balance sheet, driving activity to Columbia Trust Company as well as CB Financial Services. And that's
always been the goal; is to have that type of activity and volume to be able to scale our business. So, we have
been working on it. And I think that results of our participation in both rounds of the PPP program where we [ph]
put (00:49:49) over 10,000 PPP loans for about $1.6 billion just demonstrated the capabilities and the progress
that we've made on that.
If you think it wasn't too long ago that – well, that – just PPP alone, from a volume standpoint, was about double
the number of loans that we would typically do in a year, and then equate it to what our annual production was
just a couple of years ago. And so, to be able to do that and in the midst of that have two of our top three quarters
of production, and do it in a very controlled manner, it wasn't – other than the first part of PPP, which was all-
hands-on-deck effort, everything else was handled in essentially a business-as-usual fashion. So, that's the long-
winded way of saying, yes, we can do more with the existing talent and infrastructure that we have. But I think it's
also important to note that there's some disruption that's occurring with some of the large national banks in terms
of how they serve their clients. And that's creating some dissatisfaction at the client level that we're benefiting
from but also – they have some really good bankers. And if we have the opportunity to bring in good bankers,
we'll make room on the bus for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Good. It's a long game. So, I appreciate all that, and I think it was a good quarter, so thank you.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Terrell with Stephens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Maybe just to start, Aaron. Can you remind us just what the approach you're taking from a duration
perspective to investing in the securities portfolio is? It seems like you might be buying in a bit longer duration just
given where the overall portfolio duration during this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. [ph] We don't have to add (00:52:29) a little bit further on the curve. I don't think we're going to extend
beyond where we've been buying. The overall duration in the portfolio is inched up. We're now right about five
years. And as you noted, we split the portfolio between an AFS and an HTM portfolio. So, there's a little bit of
differential between those two. The AFS is at about 4.7, and the held-to-maturity is about 5.8. The new purchases
in the quarter were right around 6, so as I said, we have [ph] gone out some (00:53:11), but we also have been
pretty thoughtful of what we're buying. So, we're buying things that have lower likelihood of prepay. We're buying
things that have pretty good up-front cash flows so that to the extent that we are seeing continued strong loan
growth, we – and if deposit flows aren't keeping up that we have those cash flows to reinvest into the loan growth.
So, we're being really mindful about what we're doing and, of course, you know that we tend to stick with very
high-quality type of purchases. So, it's a very deliberate process that we go through, obviously, with the size that
the book has gotten to be. We need to be very thoughtful about how we're managing that, and we're doing so, but
I would not expect that you're going to see that portfolio duration extend the maturity from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And apologies for maybe the back-to-back kind of technical questions, but
looking at it based on the slide deck, about half of the loan book is variable, and another – about 40% of that is
currently out of floor rate right now. Just for those loans currently at floor rates, how many rate hikes do you think
we would need to see before breaking past kind of the average loan floor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't have that offhand, but it's – they're various – it's a mix where there's some that are going to lift pretty
quickly, and there's others that are going to take a little longer. So, we'll – we actually look at this inter-quarter,
and it's something that we're going to I think start providing some better disclosure for because our hope,
obviously, is that rates are going to be moved [ph] even (00:55:02) higher, not lower. And so, I think we can start
providing you with some additional context that will help with that.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Matthew Clark from Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Just had a few follow-ups. Just to circle the wagons on the deposit-related question, kind of a traditional –
traditionally stronger second half in terms of growth. And I assume you're also expecting that $700 million of PPP
loans, a lot of that likely translates into deposits as well, which is just going to cause that phenomenon to continue
here in the second half. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think that's a fair assumption because – to qualify for forgiveness if probably they've already spent the money.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. And then just on the securities purchases, can you give us the weighted average rate on what you
bought this quarter? And, yeah, that's my second question I guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. So that – the rate on the new purchases was 1.59% and – which is actually up from the first quarter where
we're at 1.46%. So, despite the drop in rates to the quarter, the average purchased [indiscernible] (00:56:41). I
was pleased to see that. And [ph] particularly (00:56:45) given the volume that we added during the quarter, we
had about $942 million of purchases. And so, I – my expectation is that we won't be buying in that volume again
going forward, but that – hopefully that answers your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. And I guess my – the follow-up part of that question was related to what the curve has done. It's kind of
gone against you and everybody else. So, I guess what are your thoughts on – I guess if you were to buy
something today, what is that kind of the blended rate on that, knowing the volume of what you're going to
purchase this coming quarter is going to obviously be lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I mean we are continuing to purchase. I mean, it's not like we're suspending that because we're going to
have cash flows, and things will need to be reinvested. But I would say that, of the purchases that I have seen as
[ph] waste (00:57:46), they're a little below where the average was in the second quarter. But we'll see what
happens through the quarter. We're still pretty early, so I can't tell you directionally what's either going to happen

with [indiscernible] (00:58:01) with purchases. But at this point, I guess, we're down a little bit from where we were
in the second quarter, but hopefully, that turns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just finally, on the loan purchases, I think you had mentioned it earlier on in your comments, but I
didn't pick – I didn't catch it. Can you give us the amount of loans purchased, and what specifically you bought,
and what's your appetite to do more of that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Not sure what you're [indiscernible] (00:58:35) – we did not make any loan purchases during the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. I know you did last quarter. I just didn't – wasn't sure if I heard you did more of it this quarter. So, I assume
no more single-family resi purchases.

Aaron James Deer A

We – well, periodically, if it makes sense, given paydowns in the portfolio, we might do some topping up of that,
