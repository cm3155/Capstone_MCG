MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Investor and Analyst Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings Plc's Earnings Release for the First Quarter 2022. For your information, this conference is being
recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ewen Stevenson, Group Chief Financial Officer.

Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks and good morning in London and good afternoon in Hong Kong. Thanks for joining today for our first
quarter results. I'll run quickly through the presentation and then open up for questions.
At our full-year results, Noel and I set out a path back to double-digit returns, strong revenue growth driven by
volumes and rising rates, and tight cost discipline. Our strategy to get there is on track. All of these building blocks
were reflected in our first quarter results, strong underlying volume growth across most of our businesses, with
$21 billion of lending growth and lending up in every global business and region.
The benefit of rate rises is now being reflected in our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was up 7 basis
points in the quarter, our highest quarterly NIM since the second quarter of 2020, and implied consensus policy
rates have further strengthened since full-year results with further positive implications for our net interest margin
and net interest income in 2022 and 2023. We maintained good cost discipline with adjusted costs down 2%
versus first quarter last year, in line with our target of keeping costs flat this year and within a 0% to 2% growth

range for 2023. Despite more challenged macro conditions this quarter, we remain firmly on track at this point to
deliver double-digit returns in 2023.
While reported profits before tax were down on last year's first quarter, this mainly reflected a weaker quarter for
wealth, driven by a combination of weak markets and Hong Kong COVID restrictions. Together with a turnaround
towards a more normalized level of expected credit losses from net write-backs in first quarter last year.
On capital, with a 14.1% Core Tier 1 ratio, we're now back within our 14% to 14.5% target range. We've
completed the $2 billion buyback we announced at our third quarter results, and we expect to launch our next $1
billion buyback in early May following our Annual General Meeting later this week. And with the now expected
benefit of higher net interest income in 2023, this should strengthen our returns outlook and our capacity to fund
attractive growth in distributions.
On the next slide, we're seeing good momentum across most parts of our franchise, reflecting our focus back to
areas of competitive strength. In Wealth and Personal Banking, our underlying insurance business performed well
with new business levels equivalent to pre-pandemic sales, and that's despite the closure of the Hong Kong
Mainland China border and the impact of COVID restrictions on Hong Kong branch openings. And our mortgage
franchise continues to underpin good growth in Personal Banking.
In Commercial Banking, we saw strong lending growth of $9 billion or 3% versus the fourth quarter, with credit
and lending up $6 billion and trade balances up $3 billion. Commercial Banking fees were also up 13%, the
seventh straight quarter of increased fee income in Commercial Banking. We were profitable in all regions,
including strong performances in the UK ring-fenced bank and the Middle East. You will have already seen our
sustainability announcements which we are now working hard to implement. And we made further progress in
reducing our real estate footprint with a further seven buildings closed in the first quarter. Our footprint is now
down 25% since the end of 2019.
On the next slide, we provided an update on our business in Hong Kong and Mainland China in light of the
material COVID restrictions that have been in place in both markets. In Hong Kong, branch closures and soft
markets clearly impacted revenue, but we continue to see good sales activity in the quarter underpinned by the
increasing shift to digital sales and the investment we've made over recent years to support those. Our remote
sales capability particularly benefited insurance, which delivered pre-pandemic levels of sales volumes despite
the branch closures and the continued closure of the Mainland China border.
As we've seen globally with the short cycle of Omicron, Hong Kong is now starting to reopen. Our branches are
operating normally again as of last week, and we expect client activity to begin to normalize as a result. In
Mainland China, we had another solid performance despite the impact of COVID restrictions on our own team and
more widely. Revenues were up 9% on last year's first quarter, lending grew by $6 billion or 11%, with the strong
Commercial Banking performances that standout.
Turning to slide 5, I've touched on most of this already. Adjusted net interest income was up 10% at $7 billion in
the quarter, reflecting both rate rises and balance sheet growth. But non-net interest income was down 16%,
mainly due to insurance market impacts and the effects of COVID restrictions on Asia Wealth. Our tangible net
asset value per share was $7.80, down $0.08, with profit generation more than offset by fair value movements
and the impact of FX.
Turning to revenue on the next slide, while Wealth and Personal Banking revenue was down 6%, the bulk of
those was due to insurance market impacts. We had a good Personal Banking performance, revenues up 7% on

first quarter last year, benefiting from rate rises and balance sheet growth. This was offset, however, by a weaker
quarter in wealth, with revenues down 19%, driven by the impact of weaker markets and Hong Kong COVID
restrictions.
Commercial Banking revenue was up 9%, spread across all our main products, with continued good fee income
growth. GLCM and trade were the standout performers, GLCM up 21%, reflecting both higher balances and
higher interest rates and trade reflecting continued balance sheet – balanced growth.
While Global Banking and Markets revenue was down 4%, this was mainly from lower revaluation gains and
principal investments. Markets and security services revenues were down 2% against the strong first quarter last
year, underpinned by good performance in FX up 15%. Global banking was up 4%, reflecting our different
business mix to many peers, with GLCM revenues up 21% from higher rates and volumes.
On slide 7, net interest income was $7 billion, up $483 million versus last year's first quarter. This was mainly
driven by higher rates and volumes, particularly in Wealth and Personal Banking and Commercial Banking. On
right, the net interest margin was 126 basis points. That's up 7 basis points on the fourth quarter. Implied
consensus policy rates have further strengthened since full-year results, with further positive implications for net
interest income in 2022 and 2023, giving us even greater confidence in achieving double-digit returns in 2023.
On the next slide on credit performance, we've reported a net charge of $642 million of ECLs in the quarter, some
25 basis points of average loans. The overall quality of our loan book remains good. Stage 3 loans as a
percentage of total loans are stable at 1.8%. The ECL charge includes around $250 million relating to Russia
exposures, and around $160 million relating to China commercial real estate.
We've released most of our remaining COVID-19 provisions, some $600 million in the quarter. This was largely
offset by additional reserves of $525 million, comprising $275 million of forward economic guidance-driven
additional expected credit losses and a $250 million central management provision, reflecting a cautious
approach given the increased economic uncertainty. We continue to expect ECLs to normalize towards 30 basis
points of average loans for the year.
Turning to slide 9, first quarter adjusted operating costs were down 2% on the same period last year, driven by
continued cost control and a lower performance-related pay accrual relative to last year's first quarter. As in
previous quarters, we are continuing to invest in technology while reducing other BAU costs. We've made a
further $600 million of cost program savings during the first quarter, with costs to achieve spend of around $400
million. We remain on track to achieve the higher end of our $5 billion to $5.5 billion of cost savings over the three
years to the end of this year, with at least a further $0.5 billion of cost savings from this program now expected in
2023.
To reiterate, despite a low run rate cost to achieve in the quarter, we continue to expect to have total cost to
achieve spend of around $3.4 billion this year, which will complete our combined cost to achieve spend of $7
billion when the three-year program ends in the fourth quarter of this year. We remain on track to achieve stable
costs this year compared with 2021, and we remain committed to keeping underlying cost growth in 2023 within a
0% to 2% growth range.
Turning to capital on slide 10, our Core Tier 1 ratio was 14.1%, down 170 basis points on the fourth quarter and
back to being within our 14% to 14.5% target range. We flagged the impact of regulatory changes and the unwind
of software capitalization benefits at our full-year results. Together, these reduced our Core Tier 1 ratio by around

80 basis points in the quarter. And the dividend accrual and the announced additional $1 billion buyback
accounted for another 30 basis points.
In addition, the steepening of the yield curves on financial assets designated as hold to collect and sell reflected a
negative after-tax reserve movements of $3.1 billion or around 40 basis points, which was reflected in other
comprehensive income and our Core Tier 1.
Reported RWAs were up $24 billion on the fourth quarter, due largely to regulatory changes and lending growth,
partly offset by ongoing risk-weighted assets sales and FX movements. Our cumulative RWA sales are now $112
billion. We're firmly on track to achieve our new ambition of at least $120 billion of cumulative RWA sales by this
year-end.
Just as a reminder, later this year, we expect an impact of around 35 basis points of Core Tier 1 from the sale of
our French retail business, which we expect to contribute to us falling below our 14% to 14.5% target range during
the coming quarters. But as I said at our full-year results, our intention is to manage within the 14% to 14.5%
range over time. We've now completed our $2 billion buyback announced in October and we expect to launch our
next $1 billion buyback in early May following our AGM later this week.
As we're now at the bottom of our target range due to the impact of fair value market losses and that we're
continuing to see good expected growth in the business, we're now unlikely to announce further buybacks during
2022. However, buybacks remain an integral part of our capital management tool kit going forward.
So, to conclude, despite a tougher set of operating conditions this quarter, we remain very focused on getting
back to double-digit returns in 2023. To achieve this, we need to see good volume growth, rising rates and cost
discipline. All of these attributes were there in these results. Underlying volumes grew in most parts of our
business, underpinned by lending growth of $21 billion. Our net interest margin rose 7 basis points for our highest
quarterly net interest margin since the second quarter of 2020, and costs declined by 2%.
So, despite the macro environment impacting wealth revenues and expected credit losses this quarter, the
fundamentals of the benefit of rising rates have only strengthened since our full-year results, increasing our
confidence in delivering double-digit returns in 2023 and our capacity to fund attractive growth in distributions.
With that, Martin, if we could please open up for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question today. This
comes from the line of Joseph Dickerson of Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Good morning.

Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Joseph.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one, just on the Q1 non-interest income, I mean, how much of
this is frankly backward-looking given you've got a lot of market impacts et cetera? And it sounds like from your
commentary, things are starting to pick up in Hong Kong. Can we start to see some – I guess, are you able to
recoup some of the "lost revenue" from things like wealth sales? And markets will do what they will, but, I guess, it
seems like if most of this is backward-looking, you're set for quite a rebound in non-interest income over the
coming quarters. Just would like your commentary on that, please. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Joseph. Thanks. I think it's a mix. So there'll be insurance market impacts. So, obviously, yeah, that will
depend on the performance of markets in the second quarter, but we certainly wouldn't – are not anticipating the
same extent of negative market adjustment that we saw in Q1. Yeah, there are some line items like equity
brokerage, the flow business. But obviously equity brokerage volumes for us in Hong Kong were down almost
50% in the quarter, we do expect that to normalize back. Q1 is normally our strongest quarter, but we don't think
we'll recoup the flow business that we lost in Q1. If you look at something like mutual fund sales, which in Hong
Kong were down around 30%, I think it will be a mix. I do think part of that, yeah, we should recoup in the coming
quarters.
So, overall, I would, yeah, I think you'll see a decent recovery in Q2, Q3, Q4. Yeah, some of what happened in Q1
I think is lost. And just remember that Q1 is our strongest quarter normally. So you have to seasonalize my
comments that I've just made.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, Ewen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning. Two questions if I may, one on revenue. You're flagging up further net interest income outlook, but
note that you retained the kind of mid-single digit revenue growth aspiration for this year. So just wanted to be
exactly clear on to what extent there was an offset in non-interest income. Is this simply because of the activity
impact in Hong Kong and China? And what kind of assumption you're making about on reopening when you're
thinking about mid-single digit revenue growth in 2022?
The second was around FX. I think this is something typically consensus struggles to model very well for HSBC.
And I note that there is a pretty meaningful revenue headwind from FX of about $1.4 billion based on March,
offset by $900 million lower costs based on the average FX in March. If I was to look at spot FX rates, they're
probably even a touch weaker here. And particularly for revenues, if I was to rebase your 2021 revenue for the
updated FX and factor in your mid-single digit revenue guide, it probably is pointing to 2022 revenues around $51
billion, consensus is around $53 billion. So, I mean, does that math sound about right to you? Is there any
additional color that you'd add to that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, we do think that we'll see net interest income growth comfortably in excess of sort of mid-single
digits, yeah, offset by slower non-net interest income growth, particularly given the impacts that we've seen in the
first quarter on Asia Wealth, yeah, which will hold – yeah, which will impact non-interest income for the remainder
of the year. But, yeah, there will be an FX impact. Yeah, I do think your estimate around $1.4 billion – $1.4 billion,
$1.5 billion is a reasonable estimate of that FX impact roughly split I guess across noninterest income and net
interest income. Your forecast feels a bit light to me actually, despite everything I've said about the impact of FX.
So, yeah, that's probably all I'm going to say on year-end forecast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q

That's great. Thank you very much.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Good morning, Ewen. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just focusing a little bit on
the NIM trajectory and on slide 18 you're, again, showing a very helpful breakdown. And what is interesting here
is the UK Bank NIM actually improved quite significantly quarter-on-quarter, whereas clearly everything else is

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
picking up very nicely as we go along. So I guess my question is, is there anything specific in terms of re-pricing
you're seeing in the UK to explain that movement?
And related to the Hong Kong, how should we think about the gap between HIBOR and LIBOR? It's about 50
basis points now? HIBOR is obviously lagging the move up in US interest rates. How should we think about that
impacting the NII trajectory?
And then unrelated just another follow-up question, if I can, on RWA, you've obviously had positive credit
migration again from asset quality this quarter. I was just wondering what you think about the moving parts in
RWAs for the rest of the year. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. On the NIM trajectory in the UK, I think there's nothing really to call out in relation to the asset – on the
asset side, continuing pressure, as you all know, in sort of the UK mortgage market. But the main thing you're
seeing is the benefit of the two rate rises that had already come through in the quarter. And as we talked about,
yeah, deposit beta is being sort of below 50% for the first few rate rises. So, yeah, we continue to think that we
will see very material net interest income growth in the UK as policy rates continue to rise over the remainder of
the year as we expect.
In Hong Kong, with HIBOR, consensus is to be – the current consensus in our own forecasts at HSBC I think for a
50 basis point rise in Fed funds next month, and another 50 basis points in June. If we get that 100 basis point
rate rises come through, it's very difficult to see how HIBOR doesn't react. So if you'd asked me, at full-year
results, I would have said we could have envisaged a sort of six month lag between HIBOR and US dollar rates.
Given the shape of US dollar rate rises that we're now likely to see being much more front-end loaded, I think it's
hard to see they're gapping more than one quarter.
So, on risk-weighted assets, for the remainder of the year, yeah, in terms of things to call out, you've obviously got
FX. Yeah, I don't think there's any material rate movement from here to call out. You've obviously got the impact
of M&A to factor through, including the French retail bank exit and a few smaller acquisitions that we've made.
But, Q1 was definitely the quarter that we expected to see most of the activity that we've now seen. So, it will be a
much more normalized trajectory, I think, in the coming quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you. That's really helpful. I don't know if I can follow up, but on regulatory changes, last quarter you'd called
out about a 5% RWA inflation guide for the medium term on regulatory changes, and how much of that is
remaining, just thinking more medium-term about RWA loss?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, I think at the moment, we're through most of it. Yeah, you then roll forward to the introduction of
Basel, I guess, January 1, 2025 maybe. We're actually thinking that will be a small net benefit to us. Even further
forward, by the time we're out to 2030, we may see the impact of output flows at that point which would be, I think
unless we adjusted our business model, would be a negative at that point. But certainly over the next few years, I
think we're through the bulk of it. And as I say, on January 1, 2025, as we currently model, we think Basel will be
a net positive for us.

Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Jason Napier of UBS. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Good morning, Ewen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Jason.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Thank you for taking my questions. Two, please, both on net interest income. The first is, if we take 4% volume
growth over the year and just run it into 2023 and then give you about 150 basis points of kind of yield curve
moves, I'm getting sort of $37 billion to $38 billion of net interest income. Consensus is sort of in the $33 billion. I
take what you're saying about FX, but I guess we've all got our opinions on using a 50% deposit beta in the math.
So, is there anything kind of wrong with volumes plus 150 basis points that we should know about sort of
structurally as far as the look-forward into next year is concerned? And then I've got a second question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. I mean, well, you know I don't like talking about NIM and NII forecast, Jason. But, look, I think reflecting on
what's happened over the last couple of months, I think the average consensus model was probably updated
following our full-year results in late February. Since then, we've seen very material rate rises coming through in
March and April, which I don't think is reflected in consensus. So, our internal forecast, the maturity ahead of
consensus is they currently sit for net interest income in 2023 without commenting on your numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Sure. Thank you. And then the second one, perhaps a more useful one from your perspective, just in terms of the
mechanics of the way that [audio gap] (00:28:24) I've never quite been able to square the $5 billion number, even
if you are using a 50% deposit, even today I find myself even less capable of doing that. And I'll tell you why, the
unwind of FVOCI is sort of a $5 billion tailwind [audio gap] (00:28:47) period. But of course, that only relates to
$350 billion in bonds. And you've got $1 trillion in loans and deposits that match one another. I just wonder why
the rate gearing isn't substantially more than that if the bond tailwind on its own, given what's happened to rates,
it's about $5 billion. Is there something fundamental that I'm getting wrong there that you can spot?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I'm not sure of your bond tail. There's a bond tail, I think. So the way I think about it is, yeah, we have a
gross and net interest rate exposure. We hedge about 20% of our overall net interest income exposure through
9

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
that bond portfolio that you're referring to, which we've just taken the fair market value losses on. That doesn't
provide us with that incremental $4 billion, $5 billion of unwind over the next five quarters. We see that benefit in
the other 80% of the portfolio. And the interest rate sensitivity that we show you is the net interest rate sensitivity,
not the gross interest rate sensitivity. So, if we didn't have that portfolio and hedging in place, that $5.4 billion is
probably closer to $7 billion or something.
So, the benefit of higher rates that we've seen coming through that has created the fair market value losses, the
benefit of that higher net interest income, we won't see in that portfolio. We'll see in the unhedged 80% of the
portfolio that we've given you interest rate sensitivity for. I don't know whether that helps or hinders your
understanding, Jason.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
It does. No, it's very helpful. Thank you. So that's why your year one outlook is $5 billion, and your year three,
four, five gets to [indiscernible] (00:30:43).

Ewen James Stevenson A

Hi. Good morning. The first one is around the capital market side of the business, very resilient quarter, because
of market volatility, just wanted to get a bit of flavor with April volatility coming down a bit, how you're thinking
about the fixed and the capital market side of the revenue for second quarter?
And then secondly is to look at slide 25 where you give quite a lot of color on the impact through OCI, but just
wanted to have a better understanding how should we be modeling the coming few quarters at least the potential
OCI impact that is going to come from the higher rates that we're seeing. Thank you.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Yeah. So, on Global Banking and Markets and the outlook, I mean, I guess a few things, there's nothing really to
call out that surprised us so far in April. So, very much tracking according to underlying plans at the moment. We
haven't seen any material slowdown going on in our markets franchise month-to-date. Global Banking, but I don't
know whether it's us, but our pipeline continues to look pretty robust and has been pretty resilient. Probably in part
we are less exposed to the US M&A and IPO markets and some of the other markets that we are exposed to like
the Middle East have been outperforming for us.
The other thing I would note in our Global Banking and Markets franchise is a lot of the revenue line items are
interest rate sensitive. So, security services, GLCM, GTRF, they should outperform on the back of this better
rates environment, which will help cushion if there was any weakness that we saw in some of the sort of more
traditional investment banking lines and market lines that you would compare with peers. And I do think we're
continuing to operate in an environment with higher levels of FX volatility, which again should benefit our FX
franchise.
On OCI, I think the only thing to call out is if you take the month-to-date adjustment on the Treasury portfolio,
there's about an additional $1 billion pre-tax of fair value losses which would obviously run through OCI in April.

...very much depends on the forward curve of interest rates from here over the remainder of the quarter. If they
didn't move, it would be about $1 billion. If they do move, it will adjust up and down. But just to give you some
sense of sensitivity, and please take this as a very broad and basic sensitivity, but every approximately 25 basis
points of higher rates across the curve adds about $1 billion of additional fair value losses. And the reverse of that
also being true, i.e., if they were 25 basis points lower, that fair value loss would come in by about $1 billion.

Ya Fei Tian Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.
Got it. But how many quarters does that last? So, let's say, if rates curve stabilize, and I guess from that point
onwards, will there be any benefits that we should be thinking about once interest rates stabilize at certain level
from higher Treasury returns or should we just take that into account from the net interest income sensitivity you
have provided?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No, there'll be no latent one-off gain or loss at that point.
And then, effectively, you'll see the benefit of wherever those rates stabilize come through in net interest income
and the net interest margin over time.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So, as was commented earlier, market
expectations for policy rates have moved up since the full year. So, appreciate the sensitivity that's been given on
for the year one and year five. Can I perhaps just ask about how you're thinking about things in terms of the net
interest margin? If we think about 2019, I think the Fed fund's rate peaked out at about 2.5% and NIMs were quite
close to 1.6%. I think they were 1.59% over the year. Has anything changed in terms of the balance sheet
structure that would mean that just in terms of fence checking, that wouldn't be achievable again or is that a sort
of good target to think about?
And just on a related question to rates, could I ask – if you're thinking more over the medium-term, how
comfortable are you that the through the cycle 30 basis points loan loss guidance is right for a world where policy
rates are close to 3%? So, I guess the crux of the question, though, is to try and understand where the negatives
from higher rates might offset the positive than if that inflection rate is substantially higher above 3%? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. I mean, what's changed since 2019? I mean, firstly, the balance sheet is materially bigger. So, average
interest-earning assets have gone up materially. So, on a rate by volume basis, we should be earning higher net
interest income if we return to previous NIM levels.
The other thing is, I think the market-implied rates particularly in some markets are actually higher than 2019. So,
yeah, we certainly expect to see a very strong recovery back in NIM. As you model it through, maybe in some
markets that gets you back to higher levels of NIM in different currencies than you had previously, and the
balance sheet's larger.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
On the negative impacts of higher rates, look, there's a few things. I mean, firstly on costs, the higher rates
reflects higher inflation. If you looked at our fixed pay increases this year, they were more than double the fixed
pay increases that we put through in 2020 or the year before. So, we do think we're managing to offset that
inflation at the moment by additional cost saves, and we've committed and continue to commit to flat costs this
year and keeping cost growth within a 0% to 2% range next year. The higher end of that range reflects very much
the impact that we're seeing of inflation.
Now on ECLs, I think rates need to go up materially higher than what are currently being – we're currently seeing
in forward rate curves. Remember, we're starting from decades or century lows in terms of the start of this rate
cycle. So, we do think that would have to go up materially further than what we currently see implied. So, just as a
reminder, we've said 30 to 40 basis points during the cycle, not 30 basis points, look, and we continue to be
comfortable with our guidance.

Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yes. Good morning, Ewen. Could you...

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
...maybe sort of talk us – hi. Talk us through in a bit more detail the sort of the impact of these OCI movements on
the capital ratio and how you might expect that to – the impact to reverse over the next four to six quarters?
Because I guess my concern is that consensus forecasts may have already factored in the benefits of higher
interest rates based on your sensitivity disclosures and the forward curve, but not factored in the negative impacts
that you're now flagging on the capital ratio. So, is there a danger that consensus sort of the equity Tier 1 ratio
versus consensus NIM might be somehow out of line, and if you could maybe talk us through that please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, on OCI movement, yeah, as we've talked about today, that would be about another $1 billion pre-tax
movement in April based on how rates are strengthened further in April. And, yeah, there was a sort of
multiplicative effect on our threshold deductions as Core Tier 1 declines, then you also – I think you'll see in the
numbers there's also sort of a meaningful chunk of Core Tier 1 impairment that's come through as a result of the
reduction in Core Tier 1 and the impact that has on threshold deductions together with the increases we've seen
in BoCom and now the acquisition of AXA Singapore.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Rolling forward, it's not the unwind of – just to repeat what I was saying with Jason, it's not the unwind of the fair
value losses that benefits net interest income and capital. It's the impact of those higher rates on the 80% of the
book roughly that's not hedged. And therefore we expect it will take about five quarters for that higher net interest
income to get us back to the same place.
We don't think, as I've said earlier, that the implied rate rises that we've seen coming through in March and April
are reflected in consensus. If we look at our internal numbers, they're materially ahead of consensus for 2023
based on the latest rate curves. So I think what you will see therefore as that translates into Core Tier 1 is you
should get back to the same point on Core Tier 1 sometime next year. But in the near-term where, well, we've had
the 40 basis point impact from the fair value losses we've had through first quarter, we've got about another 10
basis points if you adjust for fair value losses in April, or just under 10 basis points. We will recoup that through
higher net interest income over the following five quarters. So there will be a timing mismatch on capital. It's that
timing mismatch on capital which causes us to say today that we think it is now unlikely that we will do further
buybacks in the second half of this year, but the reverse of that should be much higher net interest income, much
higher returns, much higher distribution capacity in 2023 and beyond.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah. Okay. Net-net, though, if you are putting through net interest income based on future rate movements, we
have to consider the capital implications of those rate movements as well. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, so I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
...if I looked at consensus today, well, it hasn't reflected, it hadn't reflected the impact of the fair value losses on
capital. Equally it hadn't reflected the benefit of those interest rate rises on net interest income over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah. Okay. Could I just ask a second just very quick one just on Q1 ECL numbers, because obviously there's
lots of moving parts here, and I guess the provisions you've taken of Russia and the China CRE reflect everything
that you expects at this moment in time. So, you won't expect, I guess, to be taking similar provisions for those
issues. And with the economic uncertainty as well, there was a charge in there. I think maybe that's just a change
in assumptions. But these are things which we can look at as sort of Q1 noise, and really going forward, we
should think more about the underlying sort of a run rate charge that you've flagged that you expect this year?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Yeah. Well, so for Russia, I would say, we've obviously spent a lot of time in our Russia exposure, we've been
able to do a pretty good estimate of where we think losses will come through. We think that $250 million charge
we've taken for Russia is a good estimate of what we can see today. So, something dramatic would have to
change in relation to the Russia-Ukraine war or our position on our Russian subsidiary to get to a different
outcome to what we've announced today.
On the $160 million-odd of China commercial real estate, yeah, I would not make the same statement at – that,
yeah, you've got a very fluid situation in the China commercial real estate sector. There's been two big factors
going on. One has been policy tightening that we saw at the back end of last year that started to get unwound at
the beginning part of this year. That created a liquidity squeeze that has now eased substantially. But the
underlying credit conditions of the China commercial real estate markets continue to be weak. We did see a
number of small names go into defaults this quarter. The $160 million charge was a mix of Stage 1, 2 and 3. It's
down materially from the $0.5 billion or so that we took in Q4, but I wouldn't say – yeah, it would be a big call,
Tom, to say that was in relation to the remaining provisions required from the China commercial real estate
market, but we're not anticipating it will be a material number and it is contained within the guidance that we've
given for full-year provisions. So, yeah, that statement is that we expect to trend towards 30 basis points of ECL
provisions this year, Q1 was 25 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Ed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Yes, good morning, Ewen. Yeah, hi. I just had two questions both on cost really. One was back to the cost to
achieve charge. You're obviously running well below that and – or the annualized rate, I guess. I know the
expectation, I get what you're saying, that the expectation is to pick up in the rest of the year. But in the past, if
you haven't spent the money, you then roll it forward into the next year. So, should we be expecting that as the
sort of the core scenario? Is that the way we should be thinking about it as we look over the rest of this year? And
I guess that's the first question.
And then the second point is, if I look at your cost guidance, it's flat this year and flat to 2% next year. I mean, that
is quite markedly different from a number of other global banks who are talking about the need for additional
investment, particularly digital and payments, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm just wondering why that is so. I mean,
do you feel that you were overinvesting in the past and therefore you now, you know, you can bring it back a bit?
Or are they doing stuff that you're not doing? Or why is that sort of that difference in terms of the cost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. So, look, on the first one, you shouldn't think of the program drifting into 2023. We have a board-approved
program that expires at the end of this year. We will spend the remaining $2.9 billion. So I think it is between now

and the end of the year, and if we don't, we lose it. So, our intention is to spend that money. We think it is sensible
to spend the money because we can drive up incremental cost savings, and that thinking is factored into our
confidence in keeping cost growth to 0% to 2% next year. So, yeah, our current intention is that we will run very
close to spending that $2.9 billion for the remainder of the year. So, if you don't see it coming in next quarter, just
assume I'm making exactly the same comment when we get to interim results about the flow-through into the
second half.
On the cost program, maybe I should say thanks. Yeah, I've run the cost program. So, look, I can't comment on
other banks. But, look, I think, what's clear here is that Noel, top-down, is very, very committed to delivering on
the targets that we've announced to the market. Yeah, we've got very detailed plans in relation to achieving the
flat costs for this year. I would say, for next year, we need to find about an incremental cost savings of about $1
billion. We are working hard on that at the moment. We expect to have that solutioned by the time that we get to
interim results at the beginning of August.
And that sort of cost gap is not unusual relative to previous guidance that we've given for future years at this time
of the year. We're well developed across a number of work streams and identifying areas that we can strip out of
incremental cost. So, yeah, I would say the cost management here is being transformed over recent years. And
you can see that in terms of the overall cost trajectory that we've had from 2019 onwards where we broadly kept
costs flat now 2018, 2019, 2020 – so 2019 through 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Yeah. Okay. Just thinking that with – given the inflationary environment, that's obviously a much – you're actually
improving your cost savings and rather than holding it flat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. No, we understand that. And that's why we've got a degree of a range for next year consistent with that.

Hi, morning – morning, Ewen. Most of my questions been asked and answered, so just a couple on capital's
follow-up. Could you expand on the hit from the threshold deductions in Q1? I recognize some of it was simply a
reflection of moving the equity base itself, but how much is residual stuff and was it particularly [indiscernible]
(00:52:25) for BoCom treatment? Should we worry about a similar move in the future or actually might we see a
partial reversal if BoCom dividends sort of come through?

And then on capital longer term, and I suppose you'd be able to quantify the helpful commentary on Basel 3.1
expected to be a net positive now [indiscernible] (00:52:41) talking low-single digit percentages drop in RWAs,
sort of that sort of magnitude, any additional color there'd be very helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, in terms of the increase in threshold deductions, about $1.3 billion of it comes from the growth in the
value of investments in AXA, which is about $600 million and BoCom which is about $700 million. And then
there's about $800 million is due to the threshold being lower because we've got a lower Core Tier 1 ratio, which
is as a result of the fair value losses, the loss of Core Tier 1 treatment for software intangibles, the dividend
accrual and the $1 billion share buyback. I would – take it from all of the comments we've been saying today, we
think we're back into a cycle of much higher returns which should drive continued Core Tier 1 improvement and
therefore help mitigate some of the impacts that we've seen this quarter. What was the second question? The
second question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
So, the second question was...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, yeah, as we said, we think in 2025 we'll see a modest benefit from – but modest from the introduction
of Basel reform almost entirely driven by the fact that we've taken most of the impacts upfront including in this
quarter. So, I do think over the next couple of years, you'll see a much cleaner RWA trajectory for us with the only
thing to pay attention to, which we'll need to give you color on is the impact of M&A, both buy side and sell side.

seem to remain quite confident in the outlook and haven't really tempered that enthusiasm much. I just wondered
if you could give us more color on why you aren't more worried about the way China is developing at the moment
or whether I misread what your comments were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. No. I mean, they were probably – I mean, as you know, as we think about Greater China, I mean, the
impact on Hong Kong is a far more dominant driver of what happens to us. And we are confident that a
combination in Hong Kong, a combination of the market reopening as lockdown restrictions get lifted together,
and importantly, the likelihood that we're seeing, material movements in HIBOR in the coming quarters will mean
that we'll see a strong recovery in Hong Kong earnings.
In Mainland China itself, I think it reflects a few things. Firstly, just an observation that despite being the biggest
bank in China, we are small. We have biggest foreign bank in China. We have less than a 0.2% market share. If
you look last year, we grew the loan book by 11%, which was far in excess of underlying GDP growth. So, our
ability to grow the loan book is not as correlated to underlying economic growth if we were a big lender as we are
in Hong Kong. So, yeah, we are somewhat insulated to some extent.
I think with Pinnacle, again, our life insurance venture, we're continuing actually to see very good traction in that
business and see nothing in relation to what's happening that would cause us to slowdown the plans for that
business. We also have a lot of revenue connected with trade in China, and somewhat perversely, if there's a
disruption in supply lines, it means people are going to run bigger trade balances with us as we've seen in our
overall trade franchise with the disruption in supply lines. So, again, you've got a number of things in our book
which – we're not a perfect – yeah, it's different in the UK. In Hong Kong...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Can I just ask a very quick follow-up on NII as well, just because you
commented that you're expecting rate hikes to come through more quickly and HIBOR to therefore rise more
quickly than previously, at what point do the mortgage caps in Hong Kong kick in and how material might that be,
if the rate hikes are coming sooner and larger, does that mean that we hit the cap sooner, and therefore, NII
benefits flatten out quicker?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, I'll get our Investor Relations team to follow-up, Manus, but I think it's around 160 basis points is where it
stops to have an impact on NII growth. But I'll get our Investor Relations team to follow-up.

Hi, thank you.

Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Good morning, Ewen. Thank you for taking my question. I have just two questions please, one on UK NIM and a
follow-up on capital. And the reporting on HSBC UK Bank plc shows that NIM increased increase by 15 basis
points to 1.63%. And I was just wondering if you could share your thinking on the phasing of rate benefits coming
through in the UK, to what extent does hedging delay the impact, because it seems like from the increase you had
in the first quarter, that hedging is comparatively a smaller part of the rate sensitivity, if you like. And that actually
a good part of the rate sensitivity comes through quite quickly, would you be able to share how big the structure
hedges in the UK ring-fence, so to get a better sense on phasing of any further rate hikes on the P&L?
And on capital, I was just wondering, the leverage ratio is up meaningful in the quarter following obviously the
changes. Does that impact how you see certain businesses which have a low risk weighting and a comparatively
high asset weight, say, trade finance repo? Is there more opportunity to engage stronger in some of these
business lines? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, look, on the second one, Martin, I think that's a very complex question that you need to drive down into the
individual legal entities, because, we're sort of relatively unique in that we don't have a single balance sheet. If
you look at the average peer, probably 70-plus percent of their assets are within a single balance sheet, whereas
for us I don't think a single balance sheet is more than about 30% of our total balance sheet. So, where leverage
constraints, capital constraints, stress constraints impact is an entity by entity discussion. But I don't think
fundamentally anything's changed our strategy in any of those legal entities over the last one to two quarters.
On UK NIM, I think we are hedged lower – to much lower than some other banks. We also have, I think, higher
levels of liquidity and short-dated liquid assets. So, I do think we probably have more interest rate sensitivity than
peers, but without commenting on their interest rate sensitivity. So, as you saw in our disclosures at full year,
sterling is our most sensitive currency. And we do think what we're seeing in terms of rate rises therefore should
correspond to very material net interest income growth, not only in the ring-fenced bank, but also in the non-ring-
fenced bank that has exposure to sterling interest rate sensitivity.
