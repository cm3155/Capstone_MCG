Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release a short while ago, we reported
strong quarterly and full year revenue growth and earnings for 2021, thanks to the efforts of dedicated and
talented colleagues around the globe. We also provided revenue and EPS guidance for 2022 and we announced
a new growth plan that resets our longer-term aspirations for revenue and EPS growths to levels that are higher
than what we were delivering in the years before the pandemic. I want to spend my time today talking about why
these results and our progress over the last few years has me excited about the future and our aspiration to
deliver higher levels of sustainable, profitable growth.
As we've seen in our results for Q4, and the full year, the capabilities we've built over the past few years by
investing in our customers, our brand, and our talent, are helping us drive share, scale, and relevance that leads
to profitable growth, and we believe that will continue as the global economy continues to improve.
Our strong performance across a number of key business metrics helped deliver revenue growth of 30% in the
fourth quarter, and 17% for the full year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.18 and $10.02 for the full year. In the
near term, we expect full year revenue growth to remain at elevated levels, reaching 18% to 20% in 2022 driven
by the execution of our growth plan and the recovery tailwinds we anticipate from continued improvement in the
macroeconomic environment. We expect EPS of between $9.25 and $9.65 in 2022.

As we think about 2023, the continuation of the recovery tailwinds could drive revenue growth in the mid-teens,
which in turn should provide a platform for mid-teens EPS growth. Looking further out as we return to a more
steady-state economic environment, we aspire to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10% and EPS growth in
the mid-teens under our new growth plan for 2024 and beyond.
We learned a lot over the past few years that we believe will help us achieve our growth plan aspirations. The
business imperatives and strategies we focused on pre-pandemic, the decisions we made when COVID-19 first
hit to protect our customers and colleagues, and our pivot early in the recovery cycle to ramp up investments in a
number of key areas, all proved to be the right moves that have been good for our business.
Most importantly, our experience through this period has reinforced our conviction that investing strategically in
our customers, brand, and talent is absolutely critical to driving high levels of growth. We've seen that play out in
the results we delivered throughout 2021. Our fourth quarter performance continued the trends we saw all year in
a number of areas that are core to our growth over the long term.
Spending growth reached a record quarterly high driven by continued increases in goods and services spending,
which was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. Global Consumer goods and services spending in the quarter grew
26% versus 2019, and we saw continued robust growth in small business B2B spending, which increased 25%
over Q4 2019 levels. Overall T&E spending also continued to improve, reaching 82% of pre-pandemic levels
driven by stronger consumer travel spending.
Customer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above pre-pandemic levels. For
example, retention rates in Global Consumer are above 98% and for the second year in a row and the eleventh
time in 15 years we ranked first in J.D. Power's annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of US consumers. Credit
performance also continued to be outstanding with key metrics near historical lows, and our Card Members are
building loan balances at a modest pace.
Customer engagement with our products, services, and capabilities continued at high levels in the quarter. The
strong engagement, which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions, marketing, and new digital
services, is helping to drive the results I just spoke about in billings and loan growth, as well as customer retention
and satisfaction levels.
Additionally, our customer-focused innovation strategy, which has driven increases in customer engagement, has
continued to attract large numbers of new customers. New card acquisitions reached 2.7 million in Q4, driven by
strong demand for our premium fee-based products, where we saw acquisitions nearly double year-over-year. In
consumer, millennials and Gen-Z customers are driving the growth in acquisitions, representing around 60% of
the new accounts we acquired globally in 2021. In commercial, Q4 closed out as one of the best years we've ever
seen for US SME new account acquisition.
The momentum we generated throughout 2021 further strengthens our resolve to continue our focus on the
strategic imperatives we laid out back in 2018: Expanding our leadership position in the premium consumer space
by providing a differentiated and an ever-expanding range of services and lifestyle-focused value proposition;
building on our strong leadership position in commercial payments by being the key provider of payments and
working capital solutions for small and medium-size businesses; expanding our merchant network globally to give
our Card Members more places to use their cards; and staying on the leading edge of technology and digital
payment solutions to make American Express an essential part of our customers' digital lives.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
We're entering 2022 in a position of strength and based on the momentum with which we exited 2021, and the
opportunities we see ahead, we feel very good about the future. We believe that continuing our strategy of
investing at high levels in our customers, brand, and talent, as we implement our growth plan, will position us well
as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in 2024 and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to Jeff to provide more details on our performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations
for the future. And after that, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Jeff?

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our fourth quarter and full
year 2021 results, the ambitious new growth plan that Steve just talked about, and what it all means for 2022 and
beyond.
You see the growth momentum that Steve just discussed in our summary financials on slide 2, with fourth quarter
revenues of $12.1 billion, up 31% and full year revenues of $42.4 billion, up 17%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.
In understanding our full year net income of $8.1 billion and earnings per share of $10.02, I would point out that
we had around $3.5 billion of significant impacts from items that we do not expect to repeat in the same
magnitude going forward, including a $2.5 billion credit reserve release benefit in provision as well as a few
sizable net gains on equity investments.
Getting into a more detailed look at our results, let's start with volumes. You'll notice in the several views of
volumes on slides 3 through 9 that we continue to show 2021 volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and
relative to 2019. There are a few key insights that I would highlight across these slides that strengthen our
conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan.
To start, we saw record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 with total
network volumes and billed business volumes both up more than 10% relative to 2019 on an FX-adjusted basis in
the fourth quarter, as you can see on slide 3. This growth in billed business, as shown on slides 4 and 5, is being
driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services which strengthened sequentially and grew
24% versus 2019 in Q4. This momentum is from the strong growth in online and card-not-present spending that
continued throughout 2021 even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth, demonstrating the
lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. Importantly, this 24% growth versus
2019 in Q4 represents a cumulative growth rate over the past two years that is well above the growth rate we
were seeing pre-pandemic.
In our Consumer business, our focus on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of Card Members through
expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities is fueling the 50% growth in spending from our millennial
and Gen-Z customers you see on slide 6. And spending from all other age cohorts also showed steady
improvement throughout 2021 and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q4.
Our strategic focus on helping our small and medium-size enterprise clients run their businesses by expanding
the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs is driving the
strong SME spending trends you see on slide 7. Global SME spending, particularly B2B spending on goods and
services, has been driving the growth of our commercial billed business throughout 2021 and reached 25% above
pre-pandemic levels in Q4.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Now, turning to T&E spending, you can see on slide 8 that it continues to recover in line with our expectations,
with overall T&E spending reaching 82% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. We did see some modest impacts
from the Omicron variant in T&E spending as the pace of recovery slowed a bit in December, but even with that
modest slowdown, US consumer T&E was not only fully recovered in the fourth quarter, but actually grew 8%
above 2019 levels.
On balance, the T&E trends we have seen throughout 2021 reinforces our view that travel and entertainment
spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies, and we
remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our
consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel.
Finally, on slide 9, you see that our billed business momentum continues to be led by the US, where spending
improved sequentially throughout 2021 and grew 16% above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. International billed
business has also shown continued steady, though, smaller improvement with spending almost fully recovered in
Q4. Importantly though, growth in goods and services spending continues to be strong both in the US and outside
of the US.
So, what do all of these takeaways mean for 2022 and beyond? Most importantly, we expect the strong
momentum in goods and services spending to continue, given the investments we've made in premium Card
Member engagement, prospect acquisition, value propositions that particularly appeal to our millennial, Gen-Z
and SME customers, growing our coverage, and expanding relationships with key partners.
For T&E, we expect the total Global Consumer and SME T&E spending will be fully recovered by the end of 2022,
led by the growth in the US. The recovery will be slower for the international and cross-border components of the
spend and we've also long said that large and global corporate T&E spending would be the last to recover across
our customer types. So, these spending types may represent a steady tailwind in both 2022 and 2023, as they
gradually recover.
Moving on to receivable and loan balances on slide 10, we are seeing good sequential growth in our lending
balances, but it is led by spending. And so, the portion of our lending balances that are revolving is recovering
more slowly. Because our balances are spend-driven, we do expect to continue to see a strong rebound with loan
balances surpassing 2019 levels in 2022, but we expect it to take more time for the interest-bearing portion of
these balances to rebuild, as pay-down rates continue to remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength
amongst our customer base.
Turning next to credit and provision on slides 11 through 13, as you flip through these slides, there're a few key
points I'd like you to takeaway. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance, with
Card Member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan
balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over
time, but we expect them to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2022.
The strong credit performance, combined with continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook throughout
2021, drove a $1.4 billion provision expense benefit for the full year, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the
reserve releases as shown on slide 12.
As you see on slide 13, we ended 2021 with $3.4 billion of reserves, representing 3.7% of our loan balances and
0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-
pandemic given the strong credit performance we've seen. In 2022, we will be growing over the $2.5 billion

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
reserve release benefit we saw in 2021, since I would not expect to see reserve releases of the same magnitude
going forward. In fact, depending on credit trends and the pace at which our balance sheet grows, it's possible we
may need to build some modest level of reserves.
Moving next to revenues on slide 14, total revenues were up 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, up 17% for
the full year. This is well above our original expectations for the year, driven by the successful execution of our
investment strategy and it is part of what emboldens us to launch our new growth plan.
Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees
and commissions and other revenue were both up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year,
primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we began to see in the second half of 2021. These travel-
related revenues still remain well below 2019 levels, however, and their complete recovery will likely lag and be a
tailwind into 2023 along with international and cross-border travel.
Turning to our largest revenue line, discount revenue, on slide 15, you see it grew 36% year-over-year in Q4 and
25% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth is primarily driven by the momentum in goods and
services spending we saw throughout 2021.
Net card fee revenues have grown consistently throughout the pandemic and for the full year of 2021 were up
10% year-over-year and up 28% versus 2019, as you can see on slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-
like revenues demonstrates the impact of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the
continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. As a result, I
expect net card fee growth to accelerate from these already high growth rates in 2022.
Turning to net interest income on slide 17, you can see that it was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, as we clearly hit an inflection point in the second
half of 2021. The growth in net interest income is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity
demonstrated by our customers that I spoke about earlier, which is leading to both our historically-low credit costs
and to high pay-down rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan
balances. Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022 and likely
2023 due to the slower recovery in revolving loan balances.
So, to sum up on revenues, the successful execution of our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery
momentum you see on slide 18. Looking forward into 2022, we expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20%
driven by the continued strong growth in spend and card fee revenues and the lingering recovery tailwinds from
net interest income and travel-related revenues.
The revenue momentum we saw in 2021 was clearly accelerated by the investments we've made in marketing,
value propositions, technology, and people, and those investments show up across the expense line as you see
on slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses at the top of slide 19, there are a few things to
think about. Most importantly, the investments we are making in our premium value propositions are resonating
with our customers, and this, of course, is driving growth in these expense lines.
In addition, over the course of the pandemic, we added some temporary incremental benefits to many of our
premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection, because our customers were not able to take
advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions. The costs of this value injection effort
generally showed up in the marketing expense line.

American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
Throughout 2021, we gradually wound down the value injection offers as our customers were again engaging
more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, as well as with the new rewards and benefits we
introduced through recent product refreshes. This is all a good thing in terms of our long-term customer retention
growth prospects. It does, however, mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer
engagement costs. Putting all these dynamics together, I'd expect variable customer engagement costs overall to
run at around 42% of total revenues in 2022.
Moving to the bottom of the slide, operating expenses were just over $11 billion for full year 2021 and in line with
2020. In understanding our OpEx results, however, it's important to point out that we benefited from $767 million
in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in 2021 and that these gains are
reported in the OpEx line.
We also increased investments in the critical areas of technology and our talented colleague base in 2021, and
expect to continue to grow investments in these areas this year. For 2022, we expect our operating expenses to
be a bit over $12 billion and we see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to our much higher level of
revenue growth.
Last, our effective tax rate for 2021 was around 25%, and I'd expect a similar effective tax rate in 2022 absent any
legislative changes.
Turning next to our marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum, you can see on slide 20
that we invested around $1.6 billion in marketing in the fourth quarter and $5.3 billion for the full year, as we
continued to ramp up new card acquisitions while winding down our value injection efforts.
We acquired 2.7 million new cards, up 54% year-over-year. Steve emphasized the critical point, however, that in
particular we see great demand for our premium fee-based products, with new accounts acquired on these
products almost doubling year-over-year and representing 67% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter.
Acquisitions of new US consumer and small business Platinum Card Members were at all times highs this year,
with Q4 being a record quarter of new account acquisitions from both of these refreshed products. Much more
importantly, though, than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee
revenue growth we bring on from these new acquisitions. We are pleased to see that the revenues from 2021's
acquisitions are trending significantly stronger than what we saw pre-pandemic. Looking forward, we expect to
spend around $5 billion in marketing in 2022.
Turning next to capital on slide 21, we returned $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2021 including common
stock repurchases of $7.6 billion and $1.4 billion in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess
capital position and strong earnings generation. As a result, we ended the year with our CET1 ratio back within
our target range, 10% to 11%. In Q1 2022, and another sign of our growing confidence in our growth prospects,
we expect to increase our dividend by around 20% to $0.52 and to continue to return to shareholders the excess
capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth.
That brings me to our growth plan on slide 22 and then we'll open up the call for your questions. The combination
of our pre-pandemic strategies, our learnings from the pandemic and the strong momentum we have achieved
have all come together to embolden us to announce our new growth plan. What does that mean financially? In the
nearer term, we expect our revenue growth to be significantly higher than our long-term aspiration due to the
range of pandemic-recovery tailwinds that I've talked about throughout my remarks, which is why we have given
2022 guidance of 18% to 20% revenue growth.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
We've also given EPS guidance for 2022 of $9.25 to $9.65. We feel good about this earnings guidance, as the
momentum we have built on the revenue side helps us to grow over the number of notable items that benefited
our 2021 results that we certainly don't expect to repeat in the same magnitude in 2022 as I discussed at the very
beginning of my remarks this morning.
Our 2022 guidance does assume an economy that will continue to improve and reflects what the we know today
about the regulatory and competitive environment, it also assumes that based on current exchange rates, we
would not see a significant impact from FX in our reported revenue growth in 2022.
In 2023, we expect our revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets due to the lingering
recovery tailwinds which should create a platform for producing mid-teens EPS growth. Longer term, as we get to
a more steady-state macro environment, we have an aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10%
and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.
In closing, we are committed to executing against our new growth plan and we'll be running the company with a
focus on achieving our accelerated growth aspirations.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
So, it's good to hear about the better-than-expected 2024-plus long-term aspirations for – in excess of 10%
revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. So, Steve, I was maybe hoping you can maybe just talk about what is
allowing you to drive this better structural growth. Is it the investments you're making, the brand resonating more
with investors? And what are the key drivers? And clearly, you're investing heavily in the near term. Jeff
mentioned higher variable engagement cost. Can you maybe just talk about what should give investors
confidence that as we get to 2024 the business is going to be able to drive operating leverage versus historically a
view of reinvesting a lot into the business?
And just lastly, one point of clarification, Jeff. Can you just clarify the platform for mid-teens EPS growth? Were
you mentioning that you expect mid-teens in 2023 or more than it was positioning you well for mid-teens within
2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, maybe we'll work backwards, Steve. [indiscernible] (00:29:48). I think the language on 2023 around EPS
growth, Ryan, is meant to make the point that we are – certainly given the tailwind is going to drive again very
high revenue growth and that creates a great platform for steady earnings growth. The caution there is just you
still have some volatility in how credit reserves may play out. And so, when you think about sort of the total level
of earnings in 2022 and 2023, I feel pretty confident. Could you have some result that moves reserve releases
between one year and another which skew the actual year-over-year growth number a bit? You might. But I think
the core earnings power will be there given the high revenue growth that Steve's going to talk about next.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. But just to – just talk about the operating leverage for a second too, because when you look at – and Jeff
mentioned that we had sort of [indiscernible] (00:30:48) operating expense with the venture gains this year, when
you look at that, you will have operating expense leverage growth this particular year, because you're looking at
18% to 20% revenue growth and if you sort of – even if you don't normalize it, you're going to have a much higher
revenue growth than you will. So, we're still going to drive operating expense growth throughout this, throughout
our journey.
But let me talk to you about what gives me the confidence. And when I look at sort of what we've done over the
last four years, where we are now, and how we're exiting, what I would sum this up as, it's a combination of three
things. It is the strategy that we've put in place, it is the secular tailwinds that we have, and the momentum. And
I'm going to start from the back and work my way forward.
Look at the momentum. I mean, you've got 30% revenue growth in this particular quarter. You've got 2.7 million
cards that we acquired. You've got historically high billings growth. We haven't gotten into this, but we see travel
bookings. When we looked at travel bookings in the fourth quarter, it was 24% up over 2019. When we look at the
first couple of weeks in January, we're 44% up over 2019. So we have tremendous momentum entering 2022.
And I'll move to the beginning and go to the strategy. We – [ph] to be (00:32:20) back in 2018 and I made this in
my remarks, we talked about being the premium card provider, and I think the skepticism was for millennials and
Gen-Z. That skepticism from my perspective is over. 60% of the cards that we acquired are millennials and Gen-Z
in this quarter. 75% of our premium cards were millennials and then the next strategic imperative was SME. We
had probably the best SME acquisition year that we've ever had. We talked about our ability to be in people's
digital lives. We had 31% online spending growth over 2019 and we had 16% online spending growth just over
10


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2022
last year, and look at what we've done from a merchant perspective. We're at parity in the US, and we added over
7 million merchants just last year internationally.
And look at the secular tailwinds. I think the pandemic has moved online spending forward for three to five years
and we're getting more than our fair share. And then look at our business. We're at 82% of the overall – our T&E
business from 2019. Now, consumer is doing really well. In the fourth quarter, we were up 8%, but the rest of –
the rest of it is below 2019 levels. And so we believe from a T&E perspective, we've got more room to go.
When we look at our – as we segment our Card Members, millennials are blowing it out. We had over 50%
spending from millennials and Gen-Z increased over both 2019 and 2020. And as we look at sort of our – our
Gen-X is up and our boomers are not. And our boomers traditionally are the ones that travel and have money and
once we get from pandemic to endemic here, they're going to start traveling again.
Jeff talked about modest loan balances. That will grow over time, which is the comment he made about some
reserve increases, but we're going to get back to where we were. Well, look at international consumer.
International consumer tends to be a more traveling Card Member and that business is flat, and large and global
has not come back, and I'll leave you with this on large and global.
People are skeptical about business travel because of all the remote workforce. In fact, I think business travel is
going to be completely different. And I think as you have more people in more remote locations, they may need to
get together three, four, maybe five times a year to come to headquarters or to come to locations where they
never had to come to before. And let's face it, we all realize that there's nothing better than sitting in front of your
customers. And I just came back from an opportunity at the Amex Golf Tournament to sit in front of a lot of my
customers. So, when we look at these secular tailwinds, that's why we believe it's not only doable, but sustainable
as we move forward.

Good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of the opportunities that you were discussing. When I sit from my
seat, I'm wondering what type of penetration do you think you have in the US millennial and Gen-Z. The numbers
you just quoted were very impressive, but I'm wondering do you feel you're at 90% of that market or 10%? Give
us a sense as to how you're thinking about that. And in addition on the SME side where you're the clear leader,
where's the room for you to run? Is it by increasing the product set, i.e., either revolving line of credit that you
recently announced or is it more in acquiring new customers? And really the question is, what's the TAM and what
percentage of that TAM do you think you have right now in the various customer sets? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So, let me start, and Jeff can sort of jump in. Look, from a millennial perspective, I don't know exactly where we
are, but what I could tell you is, we're not at the 90%. I'd be closer to the 10% than the 90%, but millennials and
Gen-Z. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of runway, and maybe at Investor Day, we'll try and give
you some guidance on that and we'll do a little bit of work on that.
From an SME perspective, look, we are – that's right, we are the clear leader from an SME perspective. And I
think when you look at the opportunity set, what we've said from an SME perspective is we want to be the total
working capital provider, and so you look at what we've done. What we've done is we've gone out there and now
we've created – with the acquisition of Kabbage, we've created our – we have the checking account, we have the
debit card, and the checking account is important because that's where all the flows of money come in and go out.
From a card perspective, we've always been in great shape.
From a revolve perspective, on the card, we don't have the same share that we've had, and so we'll push a little
bit more on that revolve and obviously, on the working capital loans and some of the other term loans, we'll be
pushing on as well. So we think when you put that together holistically, we have a lot of room for growth from an
SME perspective, not only in the US, but in international where we leverage our international corporate card
business and our position from a consumer perspective to go after it. So, we think both of those areas are still
very, very ripe to grow.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to ask, maybe we can talk a little bit more about variable expenses. Specifically what I'm wondering
is just your guide actually seems to imply a little bit of operating leverage in that line item for next year, which –
just compared to this year, and I'm wondering what is driving that? Maybe you can give a little bit more color on
the internal lines within that, the three different line items in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
You know, Mihir, I didn't get the very first part of your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying your guidance of 42% of variable expenses as a percent of revenue is like lower than
2021, right? So, I was just trying to understand maybe a little bit more which line items there, is it the business
development line or services, like what would be driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. So, there's a few things to think about when you think about that 42%. Remember, to start
with, we started giving you this percentage because it was an easy way in a very volatile time during the
pandemic to help people think about all three of these lines. As you think about next year, I'd point out a number
of our revenue lines are recovering more slowly. We talked about net interest income, we talked about other fees
and commissions and other revenues because a lot of that's travel related.
So, in many ways, because spend has come back more robustly, because we are seeing great engagement from
our customers with both our reward programs and our many Card Member services, those engagement behaviors
are causing those costs to come back more quickly than 100% of the revenues are coming back.
So, really in many ways one of the reasons we're very bullish about both 2022 and 2023 revenue growth being
above our long-term aspiration is because you have this steady recovery as the other revenues recover.
The other thing I'd point out, Mihir, is that back to Steve's comment on learnings from the pandemic and the
investments we have made in our value propositions are clearly paying off when you look at our revenue growth,
when you look at our acquisition results, and when you look at our retention. And so, boy, I would say it is a
learning for us from the pandemic that investing, as you see, in that 42% is the right thing to do to create a great
platform for long-term growth for the company.

Good morning, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Hey, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, Amex was one of the few financials, if not the only, to not cut its dividend during the global financial crisis.
Steve, how important to you is sustainability of the dividend? Did that factor into your decision to increase it by
10% and I guess what do you view as an optimal level for your dividend payout?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, what I'd say, Bill, is the dividend is important to us, it's important to many of our shareholders, and the fact
that we're raising it for the first time since 2019 is a sign that, in our view, it's time to be on the offense again, and I
feel confident about our growth. All of that said, we have a longstanding policy of having a payout that is around
20% to 25% on the dividend with tremendous growth in earnings this year and what we expect next year or in
2022, we've fallen a little bit behind that and so we're catching up really to that level, but that's what shareholders
should expect going forward. So, the dividend will grow over time as our earnings grow, but you're not going to
see it grow incrementally as a payout percentage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
But I think going back to the financial crisis, Bill, it was important to show the stability and just the resilience of the
company during that time, and that was an important signal to our shareholders, I believe, and it showed our
commitment to it. So, that's about it.

Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. I just wanted to kind of focus a little bit on the cost side. I mean, you did – the revenue guide's very
strong clearly, and probably $2 billion to $3 billion above where consensus expectations were for 2022, but I
believe the high end of the EPS guidance is kind of where consensus is. So it sort of implies I guess between
credit and costs of roughly $3 billion more in there. Is there a way to kind of think about which – the big categories
are because – so that we can have a better idea of how that operating leverage post that kind of comes through?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Boy, Moshe, I'll admit, you were fading in and out a little bit, so I'm going to take a shot at what I think you just
asked. I think when you look at our 2022 EPS guidance, I -actually the first point I would make would be to point
people back to the revenue guidance, right? So, we're all about growth and growing our revenues another 18% to
20% on top of the 30% growth that we just showed in the fourth quarter we think is creating the kind of scaled
platform that is the best platform for creating value in the long term for our shareholders.
Second point I'd make when you think about 2022 earnings is, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, you had
around $3.5 billion of pre-tax items in the 2021 earnings that I don't expect to repeat. So, $2.5 billion of credit
reserve releases. I think we're closer to a steady-state position on that, another $1 billion on mark-to-market gains
on both our fintech portfolio and our Global Business Travel joint venture. And so, we look at our 2022 earnings
guidance and see ourselves growing over that $3.5 billion while making the investments that Steve talked about in
customers, brand, and colleagues to drive 18% to 20% revenue growth, boy, and we feel really good about that
outcome and we think it creates a great platform for long-term sustainable growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I mean, look, simplistically, take the $3.5 billion off the $10.02, let's call it $6.50, call it $6.70, so we see it
going from that number to [ph] $9.20 (00:45:58) to $9.65. And as we've always said, we thought we'd be at the
top end of the range of our 2020 plan, and the guidance that we've given uses the top end of our range as the
bottom end of our range. So we think it's – from a pure operating perspective, we think it's a lot of operating EPS
in 2022. You guys can decide whether you believe that or not, but the numbers are the numbers.

Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, that's a good – better thing. Just wanted to ask around discount rate, if that factors in as one of the
tailwinds you expect going forward as we think about the mix of your T&E businesses and the discount rates
there, and also with G&S and even online, do you pick up any tailwinds from expected mix shift in business with
the recovery?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Probably not. I mean, because goods and services are growing so dramatically. Our traditional mix of business
was 70/30, 70% goods and services and 30% T&E. We may wind up being at a steady-state of 80/20. And so,
obviously, as T&E does come back and we're at 82% of where we were in 2019, that's a positive to the overall
discount rate, but goods and services tends to be a little bit lower. But, look, at the end of the day, we're driving
discount revenue here. And that's what we're focused on. And so, we're very happy with the goods and services
growth and particularly the online. And what I would point out is, not only is online growing, but offline is growing
as well, and it's growing tremendously over 2020. But when you look at it over 2019, I mean, even offline retail for
us is up over 12%. So, you've got a combination of online – online retail up 31% over 2019, you've got offline up
12%. So, we feel really good about how our Card Members are using the products.

Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jeff. So, one of your competitors, a large bank, I guess, targeted lower
returns because of the need for tech investment to compete against I guess fintechs [indiscernible] (00:48:48).
But, what is your thought on the – what kind of investments you have built in, how do you feel about the American
Express tech stack and the need to invest? And I guess as it relates to maybe blockchain and cryptocurrency,
potential disruptors to payment rails and buy-now-pay-later, it's a disruptor to credit cards.

Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Look, I think – and you and I have talked about this before. Look, we've continued to invest in our technology
stack over time and, as you know, I used to run technology many years ago, and we've been committed to
constantly refreshing our tech stack and making those investments, and this year is no other. And it's not – it's not
anymore than it's been in years past. I mean, from a tech development perspective, I would say, we're flattish as
we think about 2022, up a little bit here or there. And from a tech operations perspective, you keep taking
advantage of scale and the reduce cost and then, of course, you then pivot more money into cyber because that's
constantly where you'll overall invest.
Look, as far as buy-now-pay-later – and again, I've made these comments many, many times. I do not believe this
is targeted at our customers. Look, we have Pay It Plan It, and Pay It Plan It is we believe in offering our
customers the opportunity to be as flexible with their payments as possible and it gives you the ability to pick your
installments and pay it over time. And we've had some increasing usage here, but it's not a major driver of our
growth. And if you look at the other types of buy-now-pay-later, the pay-in-four, geez, the reality is, the Charge
Card is almost a pay-in-four because by the time you pay your – on average your Charge Card off or your credit
card in a non-revolve basis, you could be at 45 days anyways. So – and when we've looked at sort of buy-now-
pay-later and that target audience, it tends to be lower FICO, it tends to be debit card users, and it tends to be
utilized potentially as an acquisition tool, and that's just not how we play our game. So, I'm not that all concerned
with buy-now-pay-later.
I think there are some successful companies out there that are driving some revenue and are driving a lot of
volume through buy-now-pay-later, but again, we look at it as an option with our Pay It Plan It. And the nice part
about Pay It Plan It is, it's not at the point-of-sale because you can – you can do it to any transaction. It doesn't
just have to be at the point-of-sale where not everybody has a buy-now-pay-later feature. So, that's that.
As far as cryptocurrency goes, look, we watch cryptocurrencies and you guys have heard me talked about this,
we think about the spectrum of digital currencies, we think about crypto, we think about stablecoins, we think
about central bank digital currency. And at this particular point in time, we view more cryptocurrency as an asset
class. I mean, you've just seen Bitcoin go from $68,000 a coin to $34,000 a coin. Currencies that you use in the
payment space, that's a hard thing to utilize that way.
And as far as blockchain, look, we've got investments in blockchain companies, we constantly look at blockchain
and figure out are there use cases for us. And as far as stablecoins and NFTs and things like that, we're
partnering with, obviously, the NBA and Top Shop and we'll look at ways to get involved. But as I've said, we're
probably not going to offer a crypto card. Doesn't mean we wouldn't use MR as a redemption option, and I've said
many times, it's a digital currency in itself. So, we keep our eye on it, keep our eye on buy-now-pay-later in case
that – in case that tide changes, we keep our eye on cryptocurrency in case it becomes more stable, but right now
I don't see it as a immediate or a medium-term threat to our business.

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about your capital return plans for next year. Obviously, nice increase in
the dividend, but you're at your CET1 target or within the range now at 10.5%. Where do you think buybacks go
from here, particularly since you're starting to grow your receivable balances by a decent amount?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, we're pretty committed to staying within that 10% to 11% range on the CET1 ratio when I talked earlier
about. The dividend will go up steadily as our earnings go up. The thing to keep in mind, though, is that we pretty
uniquely also generate returns on equity in recent years in excess of 30%. So we produce a tremendous amount
of capital each year, far more than we need to support the growth in our very spend-centric business model and
the balance sheet that results from that. So you'll continue to see a steady level of share repurchase from us each
quarter, consistent with that kind of earnings generation and that kind of ROE and staying within our 10% to 11%
range. Clearly, though, the big catch-up has been the last two quarters where you saw, what I will call, above-
trend levels of share repurchase to get us right back down to that target range.

Hey, Rick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Look, one of the things that's come up repeatedly is the strength of the millennial, Gen-Z growth. When you look
towards your revenue growth guidance, how much is embedded related to the sort of lifecycle of a younger
consumer and the growth that you would expect there? How does that play out over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think when you see us very uncharacteristically, Rick, talking about long-term aspirations in 2024 and
beyond, a key part of that aspiration is looking at the demographics of who we're bringing in and thinking about
the lifetime value of Card Members, right? We are a business with extremely high retention rates relative to
almost any other business you could think about. And when we acquire customers, we are thinking about the
lifetime value of those customers. That's one of the things that contributes to the excitement that Steve started to
call off when we think about the longer-term growth prospects of the demographic that we are increasingly
bringing into the company.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
And this may be somewhat a related question to what Rick just asked. As I look at the 2024 kind of aspirational
growth plan, it looks like you're almost back to kind of a pre-financial crisis growth algorithm with a pretty healthy
spread between revenue growth and EPS growth as opposed to like the years prior to the pandemic where
there's a much tighter spread. Is that a fair observation? And if so, what's different? Are you expecting more
operating leverage? Is this higher-return business you're bringing on, kind of what's behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, maybe I'll start, Steve. And so, first, Mark, I think I'd remind everyone our – what we, at the time, referred to
as our financial growth algorithm pre-pandemic which we very successfully executed on for 10 straight quarters
until the pandemic interrupted, with [ph] total (00:57:13) revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and double-digit
EPS growth. So, we have much bolder ambitions now to be in excess of 10% on the revenue growth side and mid

Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Okay. Sorry. So, apologies, everyone, not quite sure where the tech problem is, we're sitting in our office in the
Tower in New York. So, pre-pandemic, we were at 8% to 10% revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth, like
clockwork we executed on that for 10 straight quarters until the pandemic interrupted. We see ourselves having a
much bolder aspiration now, in excess of 10% revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth and that's going to come
after a 2022 and 2023 at higher levels than that in terms of revenue growth. And that kind of revenue growth gives
us a tremendous platform for scale, for relevance, and for getting steady leverage on the marketing line and on
the OpEx line because, boy, you don't need to grow marketing and OpEx and anywhere near those kind of rates.
So, that's the math. Maybe you want to comment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. No, I would just say, look, we've been on – you mentioned pre-financial crisis and yes, pre-financial crisis,
there were years where we were in excess of 10% revenue growth and then post-financial crisis – I mean, the
game changed post-financial crisis not only from a competitive perspective, but from a regulatory perspective, and
then we were more mid-single digits sort of revenue growth. But the other thing I'd say is, we're a much larger
company right now as well. And so when you start to think about 2024, and you think about revenue growth,
you're looking at excess of $6 billion per year in revenue growth.
So, I think when you start to look at those numbers and put those in perspective and contrast those to pre and
post-financial crisis, they are quite different. But, as I said, we have all the faith in our strategy in a – look, in a
highly competitive environment. But if you think about what's moving us – as I started this call with, what's moving
us right now to even higher revenue growth in the next two years is the fact that we've got some catch-up to do
with our core business in the areas that I mentioned in terms of T&E and in loan growth and in large and global,
and certainly in international.
And then as we move and get to a more steady-state, that's where this – again, just this reliance of the strategy
that we've implemented and as Rick just mentioned and Jeff answered the question, in terms of the lifetime value
and the focus on millennials and Gen-Z and whatever the next generation is going to be after this, that's going to

be a key to our strategy as we expand the universe of Card Members from a premium perspective. So, you'll see
how it all plays out, but we are very, very confident.

Operator: Our next question will come from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.

Lisa Ellis Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Terrific. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question about the investment plan supporting that 2024 outlook and
beyond. Can you talk about the role of M&A, tuck-in M&A or I guess I'm thinking more broadly about adjacent
areas that you're focused on investing in as you build towards that kind of two, three-year out plan, I'm thinking
about things like Kabbage and Resy like you've done in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Lisa, I think the way to think about this is, look, there's no singular investment target that we are looking at, but I
think you've hit the nail on the head. We look at adjacencies that make sense. And as we think about the
strategies for the product, I mean, as we move into – as we moved into a broader definition of how we were going
to serve SMEs, the Kabbage platform made all the sense in the world. Look, you had three choices there. You
could have tried to build it, you could buy it or you could try and partner with it. And so, it was an opportune time
and we were able to buy it, and that's how we're re-platforming our SME base.
When you think about what we've done from a consumer perspective, and Resy is a good example of that, is that
it's an extension of our overall [indiscernible] (01:02:52) of the product and an investment in Resy giving access to
our Card Members to dining and it's also a great acquisition tool for customers, because Resy is not an Amex-
only product. It has some Amex-only offers for our customers. So, as we continue to build out the strategy, we will
make those determinations whether it makes sense for us to build it ourselves, partner or buy it and we'll tuck
those things in if and when they make sense, and if the overall price is right. So, that's how we'll think about it.
But I'd just bring you back to the four strategic imperatives that we have, which is continuing to be the best
premium card provider for consumer, looking at being that working capital provider for SME, becoming even more
digital to our customers, and adding more and more merchants. And as things make sense along that strategic
continuum, we will act if appropriate.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. [ph] We can hear you, Don (01:04:02).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Good to see the mid-teens growth 2024 and beyond. I mean, I think we all sort of think of low-double
digits, so good to see. I guess, Steve, could you dig in a little bit on this January and December Omicron
slowdown, and maybe just talk about did you see a dip, what kind of dip, and has it stabilized just to give us some
comfort on [indiscernible] (01:04:25)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. For us, I think, one of the – the most leading – the biggest leading indicator for us of what's going on is how
people want to travel, right, because – as we know, people have shopped online. We haven't seen much of a
slowdown from a goods and services perspective. What really is the delineating factor is, are people out and
about. And we talked about the fourth quarter as being 24% up from a travel bookings perspective. However, the
last few weeks of December, we did see a slowdown in terms of some of our travel bookings as people got and
rightfully so a little Omicron nervous. But the first two weeks in January, our travel bookings were up 44% over
2019.
So what that tells me is people are ready to get out and get out and about again, and we'll see when Omicron
peaks and when we get the next variant, but I think society is learning how to deal with this. And as Ed Bastian
said on his earnings call, I think, we'll ultimately move from pandemic to endemic, and we'll learn how to deal with
this. So, we really haven't seen a slowdown in our billings at all. In fact, we've seen an acceleration in travel
bookings. So that gives us a lot of confidence.
The other thing I would say, though, is that remember from a consumer perspective, we're back. I mean, from a
T&E perspective, we were up 8% over 2019 from a consumer perspective in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate
that moving further north.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:06:11) aspirational guidance or long-term aspirational question again, but if we think about sort
of the long-term revenue algorithm, right, is there anything that you're seeing inside your customer base, whether
it'd be higher unit economics on the new accounts or evolving mix shift from different businesses that's going to
drive that above-average revenue growth relative to history? I guess, it would be good – and maybe this is an
Investor Day thing, it would be good to just understand sort of what the key drivers will be as we look out, whether
it'd be the baseline for economic growth versus share shift versus the different segments, right, like B2B, et
cetera.

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
... [indiscernible] (01:06:58) you're helping us a little bit with our outline for Investor Day, thank you. But, look, I
think one of the things that people don't take into account when they are thinking about future revenue growth is
retention of Card Members. One of the big drivers of our growth has been the fact that, gee, it's a lot easier when
you can keep on to your Card Members who are with you and who are spending and so forth, and retention of
Card Members is at an all-time high. The other thing that's driving this is obviously the shift from a goods and
services perspective. I mean, look, we grew – we had more billings in 2021 than we had in the history of the
company and we're at 82% of our overall T&E billings in 2019 and theoretically we're known as a T&E product,
right? So, I think – we'll talk about this, but I think there are a number of things. I think it's retention. I think as Jeff
mentioned before in response to Rick's question, the lifetime value of Card Members, obviously getting Card
Members earlier in their life, you're going to keep them longer, especially if you have the retention rates that we
have. We'll continue from an SME perspective to evolve our product set and therefore evolve our revenues, and
we'll continue to bring loan balances back to – we were above average industry growth from a loan balances
perspective, and we think we'll get back there. So, look, we'll give you some more insight on that, but I think those
– sort of from a high-level perspective, those are the things that give us all the confidence in the world.
