Thank you, Julianna. Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call.
Before we go into our financial results, let me take a moment to express that our thoughts are with those who are
affected by COVID-19 and thank all the frontline and essential workers for their resilience and perseverance
through this difficult time. We at East West recognize that banking is an essential service and we have been laser
focused on supporting our customers and the communities that we serve through this volatile and unprecedent
situations.
As an organization, we quickly mobilized to ensure continuity of operation and to maintain the level of customer
service and responsiveness that our customers have come to rely on. Our associates have stepped up to the
challenge impressively, and I'm proud of their entrepreneurial spirit and engagement in helping businesses in
need navigate these difficult times.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
To ensure health and safety of our associates and customers, we implement enhanced safety measures and
protocols and social distancings, first, in Greater China and then in our domestic locations. About 60% of our
3,200 associates have jobs that can be performed remotely and they are currently working from home.
Meanwhile, our frontline branch staff and operations support teams have been placed on rotation schedules or in
split-team arrangements as appropriate. We reduced branch hours, temporarily closed geographically proximate
locations and are providing personal protection equipment such as mask, gloves, hand sanitizer, and wipes for
our associates. For certain employees with jobs that cannot be performed remotely, we added premium paid and
enhanced benefits to help them with any additional costs stemming from the pandemic such as childcare or
transportation.
Well, everyone is pitching in. For example, with the Paycheck Protection Program, we put in associates from
teams throughout the bank to increase our ability to underwrite and process as many applications as possible
before initial program funding running out. We funded more than $1.5 billion in loans for over 4,500 small- to
medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations.
By the way, it took East West Bank a full decade to originate $1.5 billion in SBA loans. In comparison, we funded
about $1.5 billion of PPP SBA loans in just two weeks. We had to because funding these new loans so quickly will
help save hundreds of thousands of jobs across these communities where we work and live. My inbox is full of
stories from these customers, thanking East West for helping them keep their employees on the job. This
extensive monetary and fiscal support from the government is encouraging.
In addition to PPP, we plan to participate in the Main Street Lending Program and other government support
programs that may be implement. At East West, we have also taken other proactive action in order to help our
customers manage through the current crisis and reduce cash flows due to the stay-at-home orders. We are
providing payment accommodations for impacted commercial and consumer customers, our customers who are
thriving before this crisis, and we will help them thrive again [audio gap] (06:19) the pandemic is over. Now, I will
move on to review our financial condition and the results of the first quarter.
Let's go to slide number 4. In the first quarter, we earned net income of $145 million or $1 per share compared to
fourth quarter net income of $188 million or $1.29 per share. The quarter-over-quarter decrease largely reflects an
increased provision for credit losses in light of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
We generated total revenue of $417 million and earned pre-tax pre-provision income of $256 million, equivalent to
a pre-tax pre-provision profitability ratio of 2.3% in the first quarter. An important variable helping us consistently
generate attractive profitability is our industry-leading low efficiency ratio. In the first quarter, our adjusted
operating efficiency ratio was 38.5%. Our first quarter 2020 return on asset was 1.3%, return on equity was
11.6%, and return on tangible equity was 12.9%.
Moving on to slide number 5. From an enterprise risk management perspective, we're entering the crisis from a
position of strength, our balance sheet is strong, we have high levels of liquidity and capital, and our loan and
deposit portfolios are well diversified. In the first quarter, we grew total loans by 13% annualized and deposit by
15% annualized.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio as of March 31, 2020 was 92.8%, stable relative to the past several quarters. As we
have said before, we consider a range of 90% to 95% to be a comfortable operating range, balancing

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
considerations of on-balance sheet liquidity with profitability. The allowance coverage of our loans is strong, and
additionally, this quarter, we increased it to 1.55%. Furthermore, we have ample liquidity and available borrowing
capacity to fund loans for our customers, if it's ever needed. As of March 31, our unused available borrowing
capacity was $13 billion, which is sizable compared to our balance sheet size of almost $46 billion.
You can see on slide 6 that East West capital ratios are strong. In fact, we have some of the highest capital ratios
amongst regional banks. This quarter, we took some actions to return capital to our shareholders. Since our
announcement of a stock repurchase program in early March through March 16, we repurchased $145.9 million
or 4.5 million shares of common stock.
In addition, East West Board of Directors has declared second quarter 2020 dividends for the company's common
stock. Common stock cash dividend of $0.275 is payable on May 15, 2020 to stockholders of record on May 4,
2020. Our strong pre-tax pre-provision income and capital levels allow us to maintain our dividend even in light of
the challenging economic conditions.
Moving on to slide 7. As of March 31, total loans reached a record $35.9 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 13%
linked quarter annualized. Average loan of $35.2 billion grew by 9% linked quarter annualized. End-of-period loan
growth was driven by all three of our major loan portfolios; C&I, commercial real estate and residential mortgage.
Average loan growth in the quarter was driven by CRE which grew 17% linked quarter annualized and by
residential mortgage which grew 12% linked quarter annualized. Both of these portfolios grew evenly throughout
the quarter and both have continued into April as loans previously in the pipeline continued to close.
On the other hand, average C&I loans decreased by 2% linked quarter annualized. Our C&I loan growth was
back-end loaded in March. We saw increased line utilization in our C&I portfolio this quarter. As of March 31,
2020, our C&I line utilization was 75%, which increased from 71% as of December 31, 2019.
Our Greater China portfolio was $1.4 billion as of March 31 and it decreased by $104 million from year-end. So
far, credit concerns resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, as well as requests for loan forbearance have been very
limited. Credit quality in that portfolio remains stable and we are being prudent about loan growth at this point.
Continue on to slide 8, we added a more detailed breakdown about C&I loan portfolio. The largest segments
within C&I are general manufacturing & wholesale, oil & gas, and private equity, all of which are equivalent to 4%
of total loans; followed by entertainment which is equivalent to 3% of total loans. Our C&I exposure to travel &
leisure, hospitality, restaurant and restaurant supply, all combined together represents less than 1.5% of our total
loan portfolio. We don't believe they are of material credit concerns in these segments.
Our oil & gas exposure as of March 31 was $1.4 billion of loans outstanding and $1.8 billion of total commitments.
Based on commitment, 64% of our exposure is to customers in exploration and production, 27% to midstream
and downstream clients, and 9% to oilfield services and other.
The composition of our clients' E&P production is 61% oil, 29% gas and 10% natural gas liquids. The majority of
the E&P production loans are hedged for 2020 and some of them are hedged even through 2021. In light of the
volatile market conditions for oil and gas, we increased our ACL coverage against portfolio to approximately 8%.
On slide 9, 10 and 11, we have added additional details of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our CRE portfolio
of $14.2 billion is well balanced across the major property types of retail, multifamily, office, industrial, and
5

hospitality. Construction & land exposure for us is very small. The geographic distribution of our portfolio generally
reflect our branch footprint.
You can see on slide 10 that our weighted average LTV of our portfolio is 51% and that loan with an LTV of over
70% make up only of 5% of the total portfolio. In the chart on the right-hand side, you can see that the weighted
average LTV of our loans are consistent by property type. We have a long history of low credit losses in our
multifamily and income-producing CRE portfolios through many credit cycles over the decades and the
consistency of our low LTV underwriting is an important contributing factor.
On slide 11, we have included additional information about our hospitality, retail and construction & land
portfolios. Again, the geographic distribution of these portfolios generally follows the geographic footprint of our
branches, with the largest concentrations of [indiscernible] (15:28) A high percentage of our borrowers have
substantial net worth, provide us with personal guarantees and put substantial equity into their buildings or
projects. We partner with experienced operators, industries and developers and many of our customers have
long-term relationship with East West spanning decades and multiple financing collaborations.
The weighted average loan-to-value on our hospitality portfolio is a low 49%. And 57% are full service hotels and
37% are limited service hotel. A great majority of our hotels are in primary markets. [ph] Many of that are
(00:16:17) franchises. The weighted average LTV of our retail portfolio is also a low 49%. 52% is in small strip
centers, under 30,000 square feet in size. This is also reflected in the low average loan size of $2.1 million for our
retail CRE. Restaurants make up 6% of retail CRE and have an average loan size of a little under $1 million and
average LTV of 53%. The vast majority of our retail CRE borrowers also provide personal guarantees to help
support these credits. Construction & land exposure for us is very small and is well diversified by property type
with a weighted average LTV, a low 54% based on commitment.
Moving on to slide 12, you can see the geographic distribution of our residential mortgage portfolio which, similar
to CRE, follows our branch footprint. Our residential mortgage are primarily originated via our branches and their
local networks of real estate professionals. The average loan size in our portfolio is only $380,000 and only 6% of
our loans have an LTV over 60%.
[ph] For core (17:51) low LTV single-family mortgage portfolio, we have a long history of low credit losses. In the
first quarter, we originated $640 million of residential mortgage loans, which is on par with the origination volume
in the fourth quarter of last year. The origination mix in the first quarter was evenly split between fixed and
variable rate loans, consistent with recent quarters. We saw an increase in refinance transactions which
increased to 62% of origination volume in the first quarter, up from a recent run rate of 50%. For your information,
we recently migrated our process so that over 90% of our mortgage originations are now received digitally,
allowing loan production to continue in April despite of the impact of stay-at-home orders.
I would now turn the call over to Irene for more detailed discussions of our allowances and asset quality, deposit
and income statement.

Thank you, Dominic. Turning to slide 13 for a review of our allowance for credit losses and slide 14 for a review of
our other asset quality metrics. At March 31, our allowance for credit losses totaled $557 million, or 1.55%, of
loans held for investment compared to $358 million, or 1.03%, as of December 31, 2019. Quarter-over-quarter,
the loan reserve increased by $199 million, including $125 million from the adoption of the new current expected

credit loss model, or CECL, accounting standard on on January 1, which increased the reserve coverage on loans
to 1.37% (sic) [1.39%] (19:47) up from 1.03%.
During the first quarter of 2020, we booked a $74 million provision for credit losses which increased reserve
coverage to 1.55%, reflecting the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic. We attribute 77% of provision expense in the first quarter [ph] to (20:12) reserve build and 23% to
the $1.1 billion net loan growth in the quarter. The Moody's economic scenarios inform the three models we use
to calculate CECL reserves and as of March 31, our reserve reflects our best estimate of the future economic
environment and our expected losses for [indiscernible] (20:32) Furthermore, given the strength of our capital and
pre-tax, pre-provision earnings levels, we have the capacity to manage any losses that might be above the level
of allowance as of March 31, 2020.
Turning to Slide 14, you can see that outside from the increase to the reserve in the first quarter, the impact of the
pandemic crisis is not yet evident in our other asset quality metrics as of March 31, 2020, and they remain strong.
Net charge-offs in the first quarter were a low $900,000 resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 1 basis point of
average loans annualized. During the quarter, gross charge-offs of $13 million, primarily from C&I loans, were
almost entirely offset by recoveries: $10.2 million from total CRE and $1.6 million from C&I. C&I charge-offs in the
first quarter were primarily from our oil & gas portfolio on loans previously identified as substandard which had
been reserved for in full as of December 31, 2019.
The criticized to total loans ratio was 2.78% as of March 31, ticking down by 3 basis points from 2.81% as of
December 31, 2019. The classified loan ratio decreased to 1.25% of total loans as of March 31, down by 7 basis
points from 1.32% as of [ph] year end. (22:09)
Nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2020 were $151 million or 33 basis points of total assets, compared to 27
basis points of total assets as of December 31, 2019, and 31 basis points of total assets as of March 31, 2019.
During the quarter, [ph] REO (22:32) assets increased by $19 million as we took possession of a retail
commercial real estate property located in Southern California after over a decade of litigation.
Now, moving to slide 15 for a discussion of deposits. Total deposits grew to a record $38.7 billion as of March 31,
2020, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 15% linked quarter annualized. Average deposits of $37.5 billion grew $64
million, or 1% linked quarter annualized. Average deposit growth for the first quarter primarily came from money
market and non-interest bearing demand accounts offset by a decrease in interest-bearing checking.
In the second quarter, our funding costs will continue to benefit from the repricing of maturing time deposits. As of
March 31, 2020, we have $3.6 billion in time deposits maturing in the second quarter at a weighted average rate
of 1.53%. The third quarter of 2020, we have another $2 billion maturing at a weighted average rate of 1.57%,
followed by $1.4 billion maturing in the fourth quarter at a weighted average rate of 1.44%.
For context, we originated or renewed $700 million of time deposits month-to-date in April at a rate of 40 basis
points, compared to $1.6 billion in March at a rate of 83 basis points, and $1.5 billion in February at a rate of 121
basis points. The month-over-month decline in time deposits reflects the changes we have made to our deposit
pricing, resulting from the 150 basis points of Fed funds rate cuts in March.
And now, moving on to a discussion of our income statement starting with slide 16. We will review the
components of the income statement in subsequent slides as well. The effective tax rate was 12% in the first
quarter compared to 14% in the fourth quarter. Weighted average diluted shares decreased by 1% due to share
repurchase activity during the first quarter. Given the current volatility and uncertainty about the length of time that

the COVID-19 crisis will last and the consequent widespread and sustained impact to the economy, we will be
suspending the publishing of our 2020 full year management outlook.
With that said, with our strong capital position, strong allowance for credit losses, combined with proactive
management to minimize credit exposures and to control operating expenses, we are confident that we will
emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. Once we have more visibility, we will resume guidance.
On slides 17 and 18, we will review our net interest income and net interest margin. First quarter 2020 net interest
income of $363 million decreased by 1% linked quarter. The first quarter net interest margin was 3.44%, a
contraction of 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Against the backdrop of materially lower interest rates during
the first quarter, declines in earning asset yields were largely offset by decreases in the cost of funds.
The quarter-over-quarter change in our net interest margin is as follows: 11 basis points decrease from lower loan
yields, including fees, recoveries, and discounts; a 1 basis point decrease from lower yields on other earning
assets; a 3 basis point decrease from balance sheet mix shift, all of which were partially offset by 12 basis points
increase from lower funding costs.
Continuing to slide 18, the average loan yield in the first quarter was for 4.71%, down 20 basis points from the
prior quarter. Month-over-month, between March and February 2020, the monthly average SFR loan yield was
essentially unchanged, monthly average C&I loan yield compressed by about 30 basis points, and CRE about 50
basis points.
As of March 31, fixed rate loans and hybrid loans still in their fixed period made up 31% of our total loans. 34% of
our loans were linked to one-month and three-month LIBOR rates, and 29% were tied to the prime rate. The first
quarter 2020 average cost of deposits decreased by 12 basis points, linked quarter, to 82 basis points. And the
average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 17 basis points to 1.17%.
As of March 31, 2020, our end of period cost of total deposits was 58 basis points, down 28 basis points from
February 29. Month to date, as of April 21, our cost of total deposits decreased another 7 basis points to 51 basis
points. As of March 31, 2020, our end of period cost of interest-bearing deposits was 84 basis points, down 39
basis points from February 29. Month to date as of April 21, our cost of interest-bearing deposits further
decreased 6 basis points to 78 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 19, total noninterest income in the first quarter was $54 million, a decrease of 14% compared
to $63 million in the fourth quarter. The driver of the quarter-over-quarter decrease was a negative $7 million
credit valuation adjustment, largely related to customer interest rate swaps resulting from the movement in rates
as of March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, [ph] 2019. (28:14) Fee income and net gains on sales of loans
of $54.4 million in the first quarter were up $2 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter.
Customer-driven interest rate contract revenue was stable, quarter-over-quarter, at $14 million. In other fee
income categories, quarter-over-quarter, foreign exchange income of $8 million increased by $2 million; wealth
management fees of $5 million increased by $1 million; and lending fees of $16 million decreased by $1.5 million.
Moving on to Slide 20, first quarter noninterest expense was $179 million, a decrease of 7%, linked quarter, and
4% year-over-year, excluding the amortization of tax credit investments and CDI, our adjusted noninterest
expense was $161 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 3% quarter-over-quarter and flat year-over-year. The
largest linked quarter change was a decrease in other operating expense resulting from lower travel expenses,
advertising and promotions.

First quarter compensation and employee benefits expense was $102 million, an increase of 1% quarter-over-
quarter due to seasonally high payroll expenses in the first quarter and essentially flat year-over-year. Our first
quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 38.5%.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Dominic Ng
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene. Well, for more than four decades, East West has weathered various credit cycles and
macroeconomic environments, emerging stronger on the other side of them every single time. I believe that with
our strong capital, liquidity position and our low customer base, we're entering this cycle from a position of
strength. During these unprecedented times, we continue to be focused on the most important task at hand for us,
helping our customers navigate the challenges ahead so that they can thrive when this crisis is resolved.
I've never been more proud of our associates for going above and beyond and demonstrating our East West
culture and values. And I wish to thank all of them for their dedications and commitment.
I will now open the call to questions. Operator?

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to touch upon credit in terms of [ph] – so you raised some good points (31:27) around capital spend
[ph] or (31:28) earnings power. When you look at the loan losses [indiscernible] (31:31) at 1.55% at the end of the
quarter, I was wondering if you can talk about what – I think you mentioned like Moody's scenarios [indiscernible]
(31:41) as you sort of updated your CECL reserves. What are you assuming in that 1.55% reserve in terms of the
shape of the recovery, your loss rates, if you can speak to that. And in particular, Dominic, would really love some
color around the energy book, the entertainment book because those are two where...

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...there's a little bit high degree of concern around how the losses might transpire.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So Ebrahim, I'll start with kind of our allowance methodology. For East West, we had utilized Moody's for our
stress test and that evolved with CECL. And the, the scenarios and the models that we use to develop our 3/31
CECL reserve were what Moody's published on 3/27. So the shape of that is, if we're going with letters, U-ish, and
then that's what we'll kind of continue to look at. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have three different
models for CRE, C&I and then single-family, and with the Moody's scenarios as a backdrop, we've also layered in
our loss experience that we've had and certainly other factors where we look at the portfolio to ensure that we
have appropriately reserved for any reset we see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So on the question on – what are the portfolio that you would like me to highlight again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
[indiscernible] (33:11) So, two things, just with the C&I book [ph] I've got (33:15) energy and entertainment. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...and if there's anything else that you are particularly worried about, Dominic, that would [ph] be great. (33:20)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. So energy and entertainment, double E. Okay, what I will start with just with energy. We shared with you
earlier about we have $1.4 billion of energy loans outstanding. The vast majority of them are the E&P reserve
lending, which, obviously, we were very much focused on doing more reserve lending, because if you look back
several years ago, reserve lending with high collateral value tend to not have as much losses, and the losses that
happened a few years ago were mainly in the oil services and some of the downstream and so forth. But in this
cycle, things are little bit different. Obviously, we see what the price deck looks like [ph] now, (34:13) what's
happening on a weekly basis if we checked out on the oil and gas prices, they obviously do not look very good
even for the E&P production loans.
But as I said earlier, the majority of our customers do have hedges in place and – for 2020, some of them even
extend beyond 2021. We'll see how much of this price depression will continue. I mean [ph] if this (34:44) linger
on well beyond 2020, obviously, many oil & gas loans, like many other banks, will have these challenges. [ph] We
adjust temporarily (34:54) for a few months and then somehow it come back stronger again or for whatever
reason [ph] there are (35:00) any kind of government stimulus program that potentially can support it, that would
10

change the dynamic. We don't know at this point. So all we can do is that with the best estimate and being a little
bit more conservative and provide as much reserve as we feel is necessary, and that's why we set aside 8% for
this portfolio.
Moving on to entertainment. I feel very comfortable with the entertainment portfolio today. When we first started
nine years ago, many of our entertainment [ph] then (35:35) loans were for theatrical release production financing,
well-collateralized by foreign distribution rights tax credit and so forth. Today, most of our lending when it comes
to content development production are for streaming. It goes to Netflix to Amazon, Apple, et cetera. In fact our
entertainment lending in China [ph] are (36:02) predominantly to streaming; television production and Internet
streaming companies contract and so forth. So we do not have much exposure at all.
We have no exposure to theaters. We have no exposure – very, very few exposure with movies. And even with
the movies, we have fully collateralized and already have completed with distribution rights and tax credit [ph] and
so forth all (36:34) available. So we feel that currently, we're in a pretty good shape when it comes to
entertainment business. So anything else that you would have any concern that you would like to ask in terms of
the C&I portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
[ph] So then only (36:51) just a follow-up to that, Irene, should we expect – or what level of reserve build should

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Ebrahim, I think that is the question of the earnings season for us and for other banks. Honestly, at this
point – and that's why we kind of have discontinued providing guidance. We simply do not have a lot of clarity on
that and to even give a range. We want to make sure that we're reserving the appropriate amount given the risks
in our portfolio and we'll evaluate. And certainly, as we continue on in the quarter, we'll continue to look at our
portfolio to see what's appropriate and book the amount that we think we need to.

I certainly appreciate all the – I do appreciate all the new information that you've given us, especially on slide 18 in
terms of what's – so your current rates. But is there a way you can just sort of combine all this for us. I know
you're not giving guidance necessarily but if we kind of strip out the PPP program and just really look at your core

portfolio, like how do you envision sort of the net impact of all the deposit and asset changes in terms of your net
interest margin going into second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I want to clarify, the impact of PPP wasn't in for the first quarter. So that will be now really a new
development for the second quarter. Certainly, with kind of where the Fed funds rates are and also longer term
rates, we do expect that the margin and the loan yields will come down. We're doing our darnedest to make sure
on the funding side and on the deposit side, we're lowering rates. That's why we've provided all that transparency,
Ken, about the CDs as well [ph] and repricing (39:01) downward of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, second quarter also will be an unusual quarter because we already booked $1.5 billion of C&I loans to the
PPP program. So It is not usually a normal quarter. And we – I mean, once the second program started, we start
booking some again. And so clearly, I wouldn't count that as a normal way of originating C&I loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we had it in our prepared remarks, so I'll just share that the processing fee income that we
expect from the $1.5 billion that we booked is about $40 million.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just ask on the expense side, obviously, good operating efficiency
again, but as revenue maybe falls depending on the PPP program, should we expect that same level of efficiency
going forward? And were there any kind of onetime expenses or true-ups this quarter that may not repeat going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, so the efficiency ratio will certainly be a function of the revenue number. When we look at the actual
expense during the quarter, I would say there isn't anything that unusual. We are doing our jobs as a
management team to ensure that we're looking at all the expenses very carefully, in any environment we do that,
but certainly now. First quarter there's always some seasonality with payroll costs, so that's probably about $3
million increase in first quarter but, year-over-year, pretty comparable.

Morning, Jared.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just looking at growth, you had a great growth in C&I this quarter and then you have the PPP loans coming on
and the good SFR growth. Should we assume that C&I is – that this growth rate is a little more sustainable, this is
different from what you've had in the last few quarters where it seems like you've been deemphasizing C&I, is this
more a function of just higher utilization from COVID, or is this good sustainable growth at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, the PPP again is in the second quarter, right. So clearly, I can expect second quarter [ph] is again, going to
be a (41:43) nice C&I growth. But if we go back to the first quarter, clearly, the high utilization is a factor for our
C&I growth. We do have new customers that we brought in from other banks and new deals that we worked on in
the first – in January and February a little bit. But when it comes to March, I think – I would say the majority of the
growth comes from higher utilization from our customers, private equity funds that just wanted to draw down a
little bit more money, funding commitment. So those are kind of things that are similar to other banks.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (42:47) Hey, how are you doing? I want to come back to the prior question on the margin, just to
make sure I'm conceptually thinking about it. If we exclude the impact of PPP, my memory serves me – and
correct me if I'm wrong – that each cut by the Fed was around 10 basis points to NIM, so with [ph] six(43:05) cuts,
some pretty meaningful potential offsets, I know you guys are being aggressive on the deposits. But is that the
right way to think? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of the loan yields have yet to reprice, given the
dynamic with Fed funds and floors and so maybe you could just open up about that. That'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. [indiscernible] (43:26) So normally, we provide as part of our investor relations deck kind of the breakdown
of our loan book by index and how much is fixed, and we can share that with you afterwards. That's not part of our
earnings release deck this quarter. And the composition hasn't really changed. So if you look at that, a lot of the
C&I loans, vast majority, and then also the CRE loans have repriced at the end of the quarter.

So when we look at really where the opportunities are; one, mix change. We also, with kind of the volatility and
where rates were, took advantage and entered into some lower cost kind of pay-fixed swaps to kind of help
reduce our funding costs as well. So there are some – there are things that we've done to take advantage of kind
of the dislocation in the market and to help as far as on the funding side.
Kind of to add to my earlier kind of prepared remarks, I think our opportunity really is on the cost side, of what we
can do to lower that in a more rapid pace, right? But I think if – round numbers here, if we look at it [ph] ex-PPP
(44:43), we do think that the NIM can go to a little over 3% because of our ability to take down the deposit costs
and we'll outperform, let's say, 10 basis points over 25 rate cuts.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Good morning. Just a follow-up on an earlier expense question. Do you kind of view this as – I
know you're looking at expenses all the time, but do view this dislocation as exactly that or something that may be
more lasting and warrants a harder look on the expense side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that no one really know [audio gap] (45:40) this pandemic impact as the reason why most banks are
not providing guidance because we really don't know how's it going to turn into. I mean, is it going to be sitting at
home for another month or so, or is that sitting at home for another three months; and when the economy do
come back, is it a V shape or a U shape, to what extent people can – some industries have a hard time to come
back because of lifestyle changes and so forth.
There are many, many, many questions out there that people would need to ask and then how this economy
would turn into after the pandemic, and no one knows. I mean, we had the opportunity to look at what's happening
in China because our Greater China team start dealing with the pandemic in late January when – it was a pretty
much a whole country complete shutdown and for an extended period of time.
We saw that the factory workers are going back to work. Banking is more or less now getting back like usual. But
then there are still certain type of business are not doing as well like others. So we're going to need to look at
what's going to happen in US because US is not China. So our behavior are going to be different.
At this stage, I think you can sort of like rest assure, East West has always been very proactive in managing our
business. So we feel it's appropriate to take a much more aggressive reduction of expenses. We would definitely
be the one looking actively into it. And if we see that is something that we are not sure whether it is temporary or
permanent, I think that we would not be unwise to start taking down, let's say, certain infrastructure to hurt our
long-term growth opportunity.
We're always nimble – while we're always nimble and we move really, really fast, the fact is we are much more
long-term driven in terms of looking into sustainable, profitable and expandable growth in the long run more than
just any kind of quarter-by-quarter kind of results. So, that's the kind of philosophy we have and that's what we're
going to do and watching it on a daily, weekly basis and see what we need to do.

Operator: Our next question will come from Lana Chan of BMO. Please go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could give us how much of your loans has had payment deferrals so far?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure, Lana. If I look at the numbers here – well, I'll start with C&I and commercial real estate or commercial loans.
As of 3/31, the actual modifications and forbearances were actually pretty low about $80 million. As of today, we
probably double that, so $160 million. I would share though, on top of the $160 million, there are probably another
$400 million as far as loans where we're having conversations with borrowers who have asked for some sort of
modification.
I'll also add that in the month of March, we wanted to make sure that we could help our business customers,
particularly the small business customers who were suffering with the shut-ins and the frenetic nature of things
then. And then we did offer kind of accommodations for them largely to help them given the frenetic nature of
what was happening, more so than from a perspective of concern about the cash flow. So that's something that
we also did as well. So those numbers are a little bit higher but it was short term in nature.
On the single-family side, we have also – we are in states where there are lot of kind of other programs from
governors as far as modifications put in place. If we look as of 3/31, the total amount of deferred payments was
about $7 million on a balance of approximately $400 million. I don't have that specific today, but certainly those
numbers have come up from there.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. At this point in time, we have strong deposits and we are funding the PPP program through our liquidity that
we have. We do expect, though, that we would likely – we filed the paperwork, we'll likely [audio gap] (51:08)
those loans, pledge them and use the PPPL program to fund part of it.

far out are you going, are you doing three months and are you willing to go further if the lockdowns persist?

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So I'll start with forbearances and the modifications. For single family, most of the ones that we have done are 3,
and that we'll roll that forward to another 3 if the borrowers need it. On the commercial side, it varies much more
so, but at this point in time, I don't think we've done any modifications or have any plans to that are beyond six
months. Certainly, if the customer needs it, if the environment is very different, we will extend that out and we're
very flexible as far as from the perspective of what we need to do to limit our loss content.
On the spot rate of the loans as of 4/21, I don't believe I have that information in front of me, Dave, but Julianna
and I can get that for you after the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I want to add also for these like single-family mortgages, and because the LTV is so low, as I highlighted earlier,
that we actually only have 6% of our customers on the single-family mortgage portfolio that have more than 60%
of LTV. So, it is actually quite comfortable to make any kind of payment deferral arrangement because if we take
on these additional deferrals and the LTV would still be extraordinarily low. So the loss likelihood is zero.
And we have very, very similar situation for our commercial real estate, obviously, with that very, very low LTV
again all across the board. Again, any kind of deferral if we need to make, it really doesn't make any difference in
terms of potential losses going forward. So we are very, very comfortable about working with these customers to
help them on this temporary transition. And frankly, many of our commercial customers in their, let's say, hotels
and [ph] hospitality (54:00) and then restaurant business do get PPP so that they would be able to get by with the
PPP funding for the next two months or so. So hopefully, they will not even need to get much help from us. We'll
see.

So, Dave, I'll start with the leverage lending exposure. As of 3/31, we had about $1 billion in leverage lending. And
historically, and kind of related to that, we've had a Term B portfolio and that as of 3/31 was $960 million.
Obviously, the leverage lending of the Term B portfolio correlate [ph] quite a bit (55:21) together.
On the energy loans and kind of the spring redetermination, we've started that process from our conversations
and the feedback we're getting from the team where are the evaluation that we're doing. About 20% in, some of
those lines certainly have been cut and we expect that, that will continue.

Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to follow up about plans for continuing with the stock buyback given the COVID
situation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we obviously have plenty of capital. In fact – and so finally, I think in early March, we made the
announcement of the buyback program, didn't last long because by the time we have got through less than two
weeks, it's earnings period coming soon, so we're in a dark period and then wasn't able to execute. But in the
meantime, right around the same time, we all get locked down and stayed at home.
So from that perspective, I think that we will continue to evaluate with our board. I mean, we already got the
authorization of $500 million. We have only used up 100-some-odd millions. We still have plenty of capital and so
– but at this stage right now, we will continue to evaluate. And then if we feel that the stock price is at the level
that [ph] warrant for (57:04) us to potentially do more buyback, we would definitely consider that.
And so, we will just take it week by week and then look at the market condition and then go from there. I think the
beauty is that we have the ability to do it and we have plenty of capital to do it, but we also don't have to do it
because our profitability is still pretty strong right now.
