Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Thank you, Sean. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us to review our fourth quarter and full-year results.
I'll start on page number 5. Full-year adjusted EPS was $6.06, Core ROTCE of 20.5% and revenues of $8.7 billion
reflected another year of solid financial results. ROTCE was approximately 16%, excluding the impact of OCI. We
completed $1.7 billion of share repurchases over the course of the year, and this week our board approved a first
quarter 2023 common dividend of $0.30 per share. We build businesses that are nimble and able to pivot against
a fluid backdrop. We maintain healthy levels of capital, reserves, and liquidity, which position us well for this
dynamic environment.
Within Auto Finance, consumer originations of $46 billion were sourced from 12.5 million applications across
more than 23,000 dealer relationships. The average originated yield of 824 basis points expanded 114 basis
points on a full-year basis. In total, we put nearly 400 basis points of price into the market, largely in-line with
changes in the Fed funds rate. Industry vehicle sales remain below pre-pandemic levels but our ability to generate
strong originations shows the benefits of our scale and depth of application flow. Net charge-offs in retail auto
were 97 basis points for the year. In the fourth quarter, net charge-offs increased to 166 basis points as we saw
accelerated normalization within the quarter. Brad will cover losses in more detail as well as our current thinking
for this year. Within Insurance, written premiums again exceeded $1 billion, driven by strong relationships with
4,600 dealers. Our Insurance team remains focused on leveraging synergies with the Auto Finance sales team
and we remain optimistic about the organic growth opportunities for this business going forward.
Turning to Ally Bank, retail deposit balances increased $3 billion year-over-year ending at nearly $138 billion. We
generated $7 billion in retail deposit growth in the second-half of the year while maintaining a very balanced
approach to pricing. We continue to see strong momentum in retail deposit customer growth and ended the year
with 2.7 million customers, up 8% year-over-year. We've seen increased consumer engagement and adoption
trends across other Ally Bank product offerings. Ally Home originations of $3.3 billion were down year-over-year,
reflecting broader mortgage market conditions. Equity market trends resulted in a decline in Ally Invest assets,
while active accounts increased to 518,000. Ally Lending generated origination volume of $2.1 billion as we added
merchant relationships across home improvement and healthcare verticals. Ally Credit Card reached $1.6 billion
of loan balances from more than 1 million active cardholders. The Card team also reached a key milestone in the
fourth quarter as we rolled out a lineup of Ally-branded credit cards. I'm proud of what we've accomplished on the
integration over the past 12 months and excited about the continued opportunities which lie ahead. Corporate
Finance continues to generate steady loan growth with the held-for-investment portfolio reaching $10 billion, with
growth coming primarily from asset-based lending.
Turning to slide number 6, our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged even as we navigate this dynamic
environment. Our teammates are well prepared to handle near-term challenges while remaining focused on
driving long-term value. Our culture is the driving force behind everything we do as a company and I'll share more
on that on the next page.
Since the launch of Ally Bank, we've challenged ourselves to provide differentiated and frictionless products in the
market. Consumer preferences have evolved over the past decade and we've always strived to deliver leading
digital experiences, allowing us to be an ally for our customers. Our dominant positions in auto and deposits
continue to fuel consolidated earnings today and we see growth opportunities across the company, which will
drive continued asset and revenue diversification as we further scale our newer businesses. Central to all our
lending products is a disciplined approach to credit risk and we view fully to underwrite and manage risk as our
most critical core competency. And, lastly, disciplined capital deployment is a foundational aspect of our strategy
to deliver strong returns and add value for all stakeholders.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Turning to slide number 7, the building, caring, and nurturing of our culture is what has given me the greatest joy
in leading our company over the past eight years and it remains a huge priority for me. Our culture is not about
the CEO's culture. It's a culture that harnesses the true power of over 11,500 teammates and empowers everyone
to make a difference. I firmly believe a strong culture is essential to delivering for our customers, communities,
and stakeholders, and that all starts with taking care of our employees.
We've consistently prioritized investment in our people and culture and our actions in 2022 reflect that
commitment. In the past 12 months, we've increased our minimum wage by 15% to $23 an hour, which makes a
meaningful difference for thousands of our teammates. We recently announced another year of our OwnIT grant
program, which provides every employee 100 shares of Ally stocks and empowers them to act as owners of the
company. We've expanded mental health benefits for employees and their families this year and expanded upon
our benefits for new parents. The investments that we've made and our deliberate focus on culture has resulted in
a highly engaged workforce. We're in the top 10% of companies when it comes to employee engagement and
well-above industry averages. Our employee resource groups, or ERGs, were launched five weeks ago as we
expanded our DE&I initiatives and I'm proud to say over 50% of our workforce volunteers and is active in at least
one ERG.
Creating an engaged workforce that embraces our Do It Right approach improves every aspect of our business
as we serve our growing customer base now 11 million strong. Retention levels at Ally Bank remain industry-
leading, along with compelling customer satisfaction rates. We've consistently rallied around initiatives that help
us better our customers and drive industry change, and our teammates continue to invest in the communities we
live and work in. We work hard to nurture this culture across the enterprise and I'm confident it will be a
differentiator for Ally now more than ever.
Let's turn to slide number 8. Before diving into the fourth quarter details, I'd like to highlight Ally's multiyear
strategic and financial transformation which demonstrate the steady execution and strong performance over our
longer lens than a quarter or two. In nearly 10 years as a publicly traded company, we've consistently worked to
remain a disruptor and execute against our long-term priorities, which has resulted in sustained improvements in
operational and financial results. Within Auto and Insurance, we've transitioned from a captive auto finance
company to a market-leading, diversified lender with dealer relationships of 23,000, increasing roughly 50%, while
application flow of nearly 13 million is up almost 40%.
Ally Bank remains the largest all-digital bank in the US. While the direct banking industry was largely unproven
when we launched Ally Bank, our steady growth to $138 billion of retail deposits and 4 million customers make it
clear our model and our brand resonates with consumers. Our balance sheet has evolved through optimization
within Auto Finance, along with expansion into other consumer lending verticals. Overall earning assets are up
$44 billion since our IPO, which includes $28 billion of non-auto loan growth. This growth has generated $3.7
billion of revenue expansion. This evolution has created a structurally more profitable company. NIM of 3.88% is
up 134 basis points from where we were in 2014 and is driven by optimization on both sides of the balance sheet.
Throughout this transformation, we've remained disciplined on capital allocation and ensured we're adequately
reserved. Shares outstanding have declined 38%. Book value, excluding the temporary headwind from OCI, has
effectively doubled and we maintained a $3.7 billion loan loss reserve. These metrics reflect years of consistent
execution and give me confidence in our ability to deliver in the years ahead.
Slide number 9 reflects our focus on growing an engaged customer base. We now serve 11 million customers
across our businesses, which represents a 58% increase since 2014. Ally Bank customers have more than
quadrupled over this timeframe as we've evolved, expanded and enhanced our digital capabilities. Our consumer
lending products are resonating and customers want to deepen their relationship with Ally, evidenced by the

significant growth in multi-product customers shown at the bottom of the page. Across Auto and Insurance, we've
added 500,000 customers as we've leveraged our strength and scale in the market as the leading independent
full-spectrum lender. This product expansion and customer growth have translated into an improved balance
sheet composition and expanded earnings, which I'll cover over the next few pages.
Turning to slide number 10, since 2014 we've significantly transformed our balance sheet as we've optimized
Auto and expanded additional consumer offerings. Loans and leases have increased $31 billion or 26% since
2014 through disciplined expansion across all our lending products. Auto assets have been relatively stable as
growth in higher yielding retail assets has been offset by a decline in floor plan balances. While not reflected in
the charts, the return profile of the Auto Finance business has dramatically improved as we strategically shifted
into the intersection of prime and used. Ally Bank consumer and commercial products had grown 6x since 2014
and now make up $33 billion of balances. And it's important to keep in mind that while we've recently added point-
of-sale lending and credit card capabilities, our balance sheet remains 95% secured.
On slide number 11, you can see we've driven substantially higher net interest margin given the optimization
across both sides of our balance sheet. NIM increased 134 basis points from 2014 given expanded earning asset
yields and an improved liability construct. The optimization within Auto has increased yields, while expanded
consumer lending offerings have provided incremental tailwinds. Our liability stack shows equally meaningful
progress. In 2014, we were only 41% deposit-funded relative to 88% today. Market-based funding has declined
by more than $50 billion. The transformation of our funding profile has driven cost of funds down nearly 30 basis
points despite average Fed funds being 160 basis points higher. While we face near-term pressure on margin
given our liability-sensitive position, this optimization on both sides of the balance sheet positions us with a much
improved NIM despite the rapid rise in interest rates. Brad will share more on margin dynamics later.
Turning to slide number 12, total revenue of $8.7 billion represents a 74% increase since 2014. Net financing
revenue of $6.9 billion has nearly doubled through balance sheet transformation in the strategic positioning of the
Auto Finance business. Other revenues has also expanded as we've grown fee-generating businesses like
Insurance and SmartAuction. Investment gains will fluctuate with market conditions but we see a path to a $2
billion-plus annual other revenue stream. The bottom of the page highlights the significant progress across our
Ally Bank businesses. Revenue in 2022 of $1.2 billion has increased more than $1 billion since our IPO and is up
75% in just the last few years.
Moving to slide number 13, we show the consistent credit performance of our largely secured balance sheet and
significant reserve coverage relative to losses. On a consolidated basis, net charge-offs of 74 basis points
compared to a coverage rate of 2.72%. Within retail auto, net charge-offs of 97 basis points reflect normalization
off historical lows. The retail auto reserve of 3.6% remains elevated versus CECL Day 1. We feel comfortable our
reserves position us well for a variety of environments as we've consistently taken a conservative approach in our
reserve methodology.
Slide number 14 adds additional perspective on absolute levels of our reserves and excess capital. The $3.7
billion allowance on our balance sheet is roughly $1.1 billion higher than CECL Day 1 and positions us well to
absorb expected lifetime losses based on the current economic outlook and our capital position creates significant
buffer against unexpected losses and volatility. While we've largely normalized excess capital relative to our
internal targets, we continue to maintain $3.6 billion of CET1 above our regulatory minimum under the SCB
framework. The ultimate path of the economy over the near-term remains fluid but we feel very good about the
reserve and capital position of the company.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Moving to slide number 15, we highlighted our steady growth in book value per share. At year-end, book value
per share, excluding the impact of OCI was $44, up 92% since 2014. We understand the magnitude of interest
rate movements has heightened the focus on AOCI and the mark on our securities book but we feel the $44
figure is a better representation of the true intrinsic value of our company. The existing mark will fully amortize
back to par over time and declines in rates like we saw in the fourth quarter will accelerate book value generation.
The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made in buying back shares at levels below the intrinsic value
of the company. Since the inception of our repurchase program in 2016, shares outstanding are down 38%,
creating significant value for long-term holders. We recognize there's a lot of focus on our earnings trajectory over
the next few quarters but it's important to consider the tailwinds that have been created by a fundamental
transformation over the past several years.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad to cover our detailed financial results.

Bradley Brown
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 16. Net financing revenue, excluding the OID, of $1.7
billion was up slightly year-over-year driven by continued strength in origination volumes and auto pricing, higher
funding costs, given the rapid increase in short-term rates, partially offset through our hedging position and growth
in unsecured consumer products. Adjusted other revenue of $478 million reflected continued momentum across
our Insurance, SmartAuction and Consumer Banking businesses. Elevated investment gains in 2021 drove the
year-over-year decline. Provision expense of $490 million reflected a continued normalization of credit and
modest reserve build to support loan growth and to reflect the evolving macro environment. Noninterest expense
of $1.2 billion reflect investments in our growing businesses and in technology. As we mentioned during our last
call, the fourth quarter included a $57 million charge consisting of the final impact of the termination of our legacy
pension plan. Results also reflect the tax impact related to that termination, which drove $16 million of tax
expense and increased the tax rate in the quarter by approximately 14 percentage points. GAAP and adjusted
EPS for the quarter were $0.83 and $1.08 respectively.
Moving to slide 17, net interest margin, excluding OID, at 3.68% decreased 14 basis points year-over-year and 15
basis points quarter-over-quarter. The impact of rapid increases in short-term rates and the repricing dynamics of
our balance sheet creates some near-term margin pressure. We still see NIM troughing around 3.5%, which I'll
cover in more detail shortly and remain confident in our ability to return to a 4% margin over time. Fourth quarter
NIM benefited from continued increases in retail auto originated yields, declining retail auto pre-payment activity,
and growth within our commercial and unsecured consumer lending segment. Total loans and leases are up
nearly $16 billion versus prior year, while declines in cash and securities resulted in total earning asset growth of
roughly $9 billion. Earning asset yield of 6.24% grew 65 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 149 basis points
year-over-year, reflecting a continuation of trends we've highlighted previously, including strong originated yields
within retail auto, growth in higher yielding assets, and more than $40 billion of floating rate exposures across the
loan and hedging portfolios. Retail auto portfolio yield expanded 33 basis points from the prior quarter due to
continued increases in originated yields and a decline in pre-payments, which have been pressuring yields since
mid-2021. Including the impact of hedges, yields reached 7.98%, up 69 basis points quarter-over-quarter and we
expect yields to migrate toward 9% throughout 2023. Similar to the prior quarter, commercial portfolio yields
expanded as their floating nature benefits from higher rates. Turning to liabilities, cost of funds increased 84 basis
points quarter-over-quarter and 170 basis points year-over-year. The increase in deposit cost was in-line with
what we shared last quarter and reflect higher benchmark rates, and a competitive direct bank market for
deposits.

Slide 18 provides incremental detail on our outlook for margin. We continue to expect near-term compression and
NIM to trough around 350 basis points, assuming the forward curve and the Fed fund's peak of 5%. In retail auto,
we added 395 basis points of price into the market in 2022 and are currently originating loans in the 10% range.
On the positive side, our OSA pricing has moved up 280 basis points as of year-end. The prices in retail auto
were 115 basis points in excess of what we pass-through on OSA. Despite that surprising momentum, the timing
dynamics we have highlighted previously will remain a margin headwind until we get through the Fed tightening
cycle. Similar to the last quarter, the bottom of the page highlights the two largest drivers of our NIM trajectory.
Retail originated yields were 9.57% and given the portfolio yield it's still more than 150 basis points lower than
originated yields. We see meaningful portfolio expansion ahead. By the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect portfolio
yield will increase to roughly 9% without assuming any incremental pricing actions on new retail auto originations.
The bottom right shows the evolution of retail deposit pricing. At year-end, our OSA was priced at 330 basis
points while average retail deposit cost in the quarter were just over 240 basis points. Deposit pricing has
remained dynamic and competitive and incremental betas were a little higher in the fourth quarter. And while
we're not providing a specific outlook for OSA pricing, we continue to see a 3.5% NIM trough in a scenario where
liquid deposits go to 375 basis points. Clearly, there is a range of possible outcomes but we feel very good about
our overall NIM trajectory.
Turning to slide 19, our CET1 ratio remained at 9.3% as earnings supported $2 billion in RWA growth. In 2022,
we executed $1.7 billion of share repurchases as we continue to normalize excess capital. Additionally, we
announced a dividend of $0.30 per share for the first quarter. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation and
currently maintain $3.6 billion of CET1 in excess of our SCB requirements. Our priority is to remain focused on
maintaining prudent capital levels amid continued uncertainty while investing in our businesses and supporting
our customers.
Let's turn to slide 20 to review asset quality trends. Consolidated net charge-offs of 116 basis points reflected the
combination of normalization and seasonality. Comparisons to the prior year and pre-pandemic periods are
influenced by the addition of unsecured lending which added 11 basis points. I'll provide more color on retail auto
credit shortly but trends remain generally in-line with our expectations. We are closely monitoring performance
trends across the portfolio to inform tactical actions and risk tolerance as we continue to manage through credit
normalization. In the bottom right, 30-day delinquencies increased due to typical seasonality and have normalized
back to 2019 levels. 60-day delinquencies are elevated versus 2019, given strategic shift in collection practices
but we continue to see favorable total loss rates. We expect continued increases in delinquencies and are closely
monitoring consumer health and the impact of persistent inflation on spending and savings trends. The
investments we've made within servicing and collections over the past few years will enhance our ability to
communicate with and support our customers.
Slide 21 shows that consolidated coverage increased 1 basis point to 2.72%, primarily reflecting growth in our
retail auto and unsecured lending portfolios. Total reserve increased to $3.7 billion or $1.1 billion higher than
CECL Day 1 levels as we accounted for modest loan growth and the current macroeconomic outlook, which has
the unemployment rate approaching 5% by year-end. Retail auto coverage of 3.6% increased 4 basis points
quarter-over-quarter and is 26 basis points higher than CECL Day 1. Total retail auto reserves at $3 billion are up
roughly $600 million or 25% versus CECL Day 1.
Slide 22 provides a detailed view of originations dating back to 2016 bucketed into our proprietary credit tiers. As
a full-spectrum lender with critical scale, we are able to opportunistically focus on market segments where we see
the most value, while supporting our dealer customers. Since 2016, originations from our top two tiers have
remained consistent in the 75% range, while we slightly decrease our exposure to lower credit tiers. Our approach
to risk-based pricing is evident on the right side of the page. In total, we added 395 basis points of price in 2022,

which was intentionally added across the credit spectrum. Like some other lenders, we weren't able to add as
much price into higher FICO segments, but we aggressively added price to higher risk tranches to buffer returns
from losses that may exceed underwritten expectations. The bottom of the page highlights a few originated stats,
showing our strategic shift toward used, which has largely driven yield expansion despite stable credit origination
trends over the past seven years.
On slide 23, we show our forecast for used vehicle values, which has remained largely consistent for the past 12
months. In 2022, we saw a 19% decline from peak values, most of which was realized during the second half of
the year. We are projecting a further decline of 13% from current levels, which will result in a 30% total decline
from 4Q 2021 to the end of 2023 consistent with previous guidance. There are certainly other views on used
values out there, most of which are projecting smaller declines in 2023. While we do see the possibility for a
smaller decline in 2023 based on the supply and demand dynamics at play, we continue to maintain a
conservative stance.
Turning to slide 24, we have added some details and what we're seeing within the retail auto portfolio regarding
vintage performance. We have continued to see strong performance from vintages originated through mid-2021.
These loans have now passed their peak loss period and we expect lifetime losses to be favorable to price
expectations. We are seeing elevated delinquency and loss trends in the vintages originated from late 2021
through mid-2022, consistent with what others have observed in the industry. These vintages currently account
for about 38% of the portfolio and are just entering peak losses. Although we expect that cohort to amortize to
about 24% of the book by the end of this year, we do expect elevated losses in those vintages to impact our full-
year 2023 net charge-off rate. As we've discussed previously, we have been taking underwriting and pricing
actions to reduce the risk content of new originations. By the end of this year, these latest originations will account
for the majority of the portfolio and loss content heading into 2024.
Slide 25 provides an update on retail auto's net charge-off expectations. Our 2023 net charge-off outlook
assumes a mild recession in 2023, along with a 13% further decline in used values just discussed. Loss
performance in December was consistent with what we expect on a normalized basis and we assume full
normalization of the portfolio in first quarter of 2023. Peak losses on the late 2021 and early 2022 vintages and
increasing unemployment drive elevated losses late in the year and a full-year 2023 net charge-off rate of around
1.7%. The bottom of the slide provides perspective on how we currently expect losses to materialize throughout
2023. We've also included historical references which have shown similar seasonality. Overall, expected losses
are up approximately 30 basis points from those periods and are slightly elevated relative to what we'd expect for
the normalized risk profile of our originations. We expect 2023 to continue to be a very dynamic environment and
we'll continue to be transparent about what we're seeing in our current expectations for the year.
On slide 26, we've laid out various actions we've taken throughout 2022 to mitigate risk on new originations and
how we're prepared to manage credit through the cycle by focusing on what we can control. Front-end actions,
including modifying decision strategy, implementing pricing increments and curtailing risk help to ensure we're
originating loans at adequate risk-adjusted returns. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels through the cycle and
investing in digital capabilities proactively positions us to handle normalized credit conditions.
Moving now to Ally Bank on slide 27. Retail deposits of $138 billion increased $3.8 billion quarter-over-quarter,
reflecting continued growth and solid inflows from traditional banks. Total deposit balances of $152 billion
increased $6 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven by incremental growth from broker deposits. Given the continued
momentum across the deposit franchise, we're currently 88% deposit-funded. We delivered our strongest quarter
of customer growth since the second quarter of 2020, adding 85,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, our
55th consecutive quarter of growth. Since we founded Ally Bank, balance growth and retention have been

foundational aspects of our retail deposit strategy. We continue to lead the industry with a 96% customer retention
rate. Customer acquisition, especially within younger generations, is noteworthy. The customer demographics in
the bottom right highlight the long-term opportunity we have to deepen relationships by being part of our
customer's financial journey from the early stages.
Turning to slide 28, we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms. Deposits
continue to serve as the primary gateway to our other banking products, which enhance brand loyalty, drive
engagement and deepen customer relationships. The strength of our brand allows us to build on current
momentum across our newer consumer lending products. Ally Invest continue to increase depth and strength of
customer relationships at Ally Bank. The percentage of new accounts opened by existing customers remains
above 70%. Card balances of $1.6 billion are derived from 1 million active customers, reflecting our strategy of
low and grow credit lines. Ally Lending balances of $2 billion highlights the momentum across healthcare and
home improvement verticals. And we continue to see balanced opportunity for accretive growth in these portfolios
as they currently comprise less than 5% of our earning assets.
Let's turn to slide 29 for the Auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of $437 million was a result of continuing
pricing actions as well as balanced growth within the retail and commercial auto, offset by higher provision. The
increase in provision expense versus the prior year reflects historically loss performance in 2021. Looking at the
bottom-left, originated retail auto yield of 9.57% was up 82 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting significant
pricing actions. As mentioned previously, we put nearly 400 basis points of price into the market in 2022 and are
continuing to see solid flows with originated yields above 10%. This show further expansion of the portfolio yield
and we expect this to continue over the medium-term given the strength and scale of our franchise. The bottom-
right shows lease portfolio trends. Despite the decline in used values, gain per unit was up quarter-over-quarter,
given the decline in lessee and dealer buyouts.
Turning to slide 30, we continue to realize the benefits of our leading Agile platform underpinned by a high-tech
and high-touch model. Consistent application flow shown in the top-left enables us to be selective in what we
approve and ultimately originate. Applications and approvals have been relatively stable over the past couple
years but we did target as tick-down in approval rate as we proactively managed risk through detailed micro
segment analysis. In the upper-right and in consumer assets of $94 billion are up 6% on a year-over-year basis.
Commercial balances ended at $18.8 billion as new vehicle supply remains pressured but has shown some signs
of normalization. Turning to origination trends on the bottom-half of the page, consumer Auto volume of $9.2
billion demonstrates our ability to add price in the market and maintain solid origination volume. This culminated in
full-year originations of $46 billion. We remain nimble and are not tied to any target but we would expect to
generate originations in the low $40 billion range in 2023. Lastly, used accounted for 60% of originations in the
quarter, while non-prime declined to 7% of volume given ongoing risk management and seasonal trends.
Turning to Insurance results in slide 31, core pre-tax income at $52 million decreased year-over-year from the
impact of lower investment gains given the market backdrop. Total written premiums of $285 million increased
year-over-year but still reflect headwinds from lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry. Last
quarter, we shared some context on how our proactive approach and dealer relationships were able to limit losses
related to Hurricane Ian. We continue to see favorable results and expect minimal loss content as shown in the
bottom-left chart. Going forward, we remain focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic
offerings to drive further integration of Insurance across Auto Finance.
Turning to Corporate Finance on slide 32, core income of $67 million reflected disciplined growth in the portfolio
and stable credit trends. Net financing revenue was driven by higher asset balances as well as higher
benchmarks as the entire portfolio is floating rate. The loan portfolio is diversified across industries with asset-

based loans comprising 55% of the portfolio and a first-lien position in virtually 100% of exposures. Our $10.1
billion HFI portfolio is up 31% year-over-year, reflecting our expertise and disciplined growth within a highly
competitive market.
Mortgage details are on slide 33. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $19 million and $170 million of DTC
originations, reflecting tighter margins on conforming production and effectively zero demand for refinancing
activity. Mortgage is an important product for our customers who value a modern and seamless digital platform.
We're focused on a great experience for our customers but refrain from any specific volume targets.
Before closing, I'll share a few thoughts on the outlook for 2023. On slide 34, we show key drivers of expected
2023 expense growth. While headline expenses are projected to grow roughly 6%, it's important to look a little
closer at the details. Roughly half of the year-over-year growth is comprised of non-discretionary items, including
an industry-wide increase in FDIC fees and insurance expenses, primarily commissions which have a direct offset
in revenue and weather losses. Growth also includes increased costs to ensure we're able to provide leading
service to our customers, support continued credit normalization and manage lost exposure. The remaining
increases in expenses consists of variable costs directly tied to revenue growth like servicing and acquisition
costs in auto and card and long-term investment across the enterprise like cyber. So, what you traditionally think
of as discretionary expenses are driving approximately 1% or 2% of expense growth in 2023. We acknowledge
the revenue headwinds present this year and remained very focused on efficient expense deployment.
Slide 35 contains our financial outlook as we see it today. Clearly, the dynamic environment makes it harder than
ever to provide granular guidance but we remain committed to transparency. Based on what we know today, we
see adjusted EPS of approximately $4 in 2023, the main drivers of which include NIM of 3.5%, which we've
covered previously; other revenue expanding to roughly $500 million per quarter, modest earning asset growth,
mid-single digit expense growth, retail auto net charge-offs of 1.6% to 1.8% and consolidated net charge-offs of
1.2% to 1.4%. And, finally, a tax rate in the 21% to 22% range, slightly favorable versus our historic average,
given ongoing tax planning strategies.
We've also provided our thoughts on earnings trajectory beyond 2023. We expect earnings expansion over the
next several years as NIM moves past the trough and migrates toward 4%. Based on what we know today, we
can see a path to that $6 as early as 2024, but obviously several variables will ultimately dictate the pace of EPS
expansion. We continue to view mid-teens as the return profile of the company, based on all the structural
enhancements we've made over the past several years. We acknowledge 2023 will be a very dynamic year given
macroeconomic headwinds and volatility. But we're confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive long-
term profitability.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Brad. I thought I would close by highlighting several of my near-term priorities. First and foremost is
credit risk. As I've said before, our ability to underwrite and manage credit risk is our core competency. I'm
confident the investments we've continued to make in risk management position us well to navigate this fluid
environment. The bar on cybersecurity risk management continues to move higher and we're committed to
protecting our customers from external threats. I'm thankful for the talent of our CIO and CISO and the broad
cyber teams that exist at Ally. Taking care of our people and maintaining a purpose-driven culture is even more
important during periods of heightened uncertainty. Our continued emphasis on essentialism will drive operating
efficiencies over time. While we are focused on tactfully navigating this dynamic environment in the near-term,

we're committed to continuing to execute on our long-term priorities. And, finally, we must live our name and be
an ally now more than ever. We're going to support our dealer, corporate finance and consumer bank customers.
Staying true to our name and promise has driven our unique growth and retention of customers. I remain
incredibly proud to lead our company and, over time, I'm confident these priorities will serve us well and deliver
value for all stakeholders.
I know the deck today was longer than normal but we thought it was important to really give that longer-term view
and focus on the trends that we've executed on since we went public and also hit the things that are top-of-mind
for all of you and top-of-mind for investors, things like credit and margin, so we tried to evolve the deck this time.
We know we added several pages but we thought that transparency was very important.
And with that, Sean, back to you. And we can head into Q&A.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great and thanks for that extra disclosure. Just to drill in a little bit on the credit loss outlook and how we should
think about it, could you talk a little bit about the impact of frequency versus severity? The period that you saw
from the middle of 2021 to 2022, those originations, what are you seeing that's driving that higher loss and how
does that inform us just to the path in 2023 and 2024 for the overall loss rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Brown A
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Moshe. It's Brad. I'll start on that one and JB can certainly add in. As you mentioned, we did
highlight that kind of late 2021, early 2022 vintage. From a frequency perspective, we did see that kind of
normalization pace accelerate in the fourth quarter and a couple of variables too that are important.
One, as customers really get to that stage earlier in the cycle of the loan, that is typically a higher balance at
charge-off was certainly impactful. And then as well, as noted we did see some acceleration in used car values in
the late part of the year, which were also impactful.
As we think, forward-term, into 2023 here, as I mentioned that vintage was about almost 40% of the book at the
end of the year. As that continues to normalize, it will work that through the system here in 2023. And I think that
that will, as we mentioned, be impactful to the 1.7% rate that we highlight as well. But then at the same time,
we've taken, as noted, significant actions tactically around risk management and trimming some of the risks that

we see, particularly around micro segmentation which has really reduced the loss expectations on that more
recent book, and then couple that with the really strong outperforming back book really kind of gives us comfort
there in terms of that range.
And then ultimately the macro environment is certainly impactful. As mentioned, this does assume – we are
assuming a mild recession in 2023. That's really led by contraction in GDP for the first couple of quarters and then
ultimately unemployment getting near 5% by the end of 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And the margin outlook is roughly consistent with where you had been, although rates have
moved up a little bit more. What has countered that? Has it been the yield on Auto? I mean I think your
performance this quarter was a little better than we had been expecting. Can you talk a little bit about what drove,
how we should think about what's happened on the yield side, I guess?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Brown A
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Well, I'd go back to all the enhancements that JB highlighted at the beginning. Structurally, that is
continuing to be a significant part of the expansion just generally from an overall company and balance sheet
perspective. I would say that retail portfolio yields continues to expand. I think that – those levels, I think have
been a little bit underestimated as well. And I think again, putting on good solid business at 10% yields, high-9s
during the fourth quarter was also impactful.
And then you think about things like the hedges that we have, which really do provide a nice bridge for us. As you
think about the increase in Fed funds in the fourth quarter, 125 basis points was dramatic. So, that did reprice the
OSA portfolio as we also highlighted. But the hedges really do kind of help us bridge the 4Q through really most of
2023 to kind of give time for the retail auto portfolio needle to really overwhelm the increase in liability costs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The only thing Moshe maybe I would add just a couple of things on – it's really slide 30. We didn't spend a
ton of time drilling into the – what we did in the quarter, but you'll see auto originations. We pared back fairly
considerably in the fourth quarter from where we had been running. And I'd say that was probably driven in
twofold. One, just being ever more deliberate on credit management. And as Brad talked about, trimming some of
those micro segments and things like that. But you also saw a decent pop in what we were doing in the new
space. And part of this we just think is a function and I talked about it at one of the industry conferences in
December. You get to kind of a 10% pay per yield on new consumer originations. We hit a bit of a saturation point
with the consumers. So part of that, all those factors sort of drove into kind of lower volumes and maybe a little
less risk appetite in the fourth quarter as well.

allowance from a macro perspective? I know you said 5% of unemployment by the end of the year. And just how
are you thinking about future reserve builds here given the fact that you are expecting a modest recession in the
near-term? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Brown A
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yes. Hey, good morning, Ryan. Sure. So I guess I'd start by saying we did mention the macroeconomic, it
certainly has evolved since third quarter. And we pointed it out and you did as well, GDP contraction as well as
higher unemployment by the end of the year approaching 5%.
I'd start with by saying, we, and JB pointed this out, we continue to be really generally conservative in our overall
reserving methodology. That includes the assumptions that we make in our CECL framework as well when you
think about our 12-month supportable and then the 24-month reversion as well. And the lookback there, which
includes the Great Recession, so kind of getting to that kind of reversion mean of 6.3% in unemployment. So,
when we kind of think about 3.6% coverage versus that range of 1.6% to 1.8%. And my kind of simple broad
math, when you think about even the high-end of that range, if you allocate that annualized number over our
weighted average life of Auto, which is 22 months or so, you would see that we're really well-covered even at the
higher end of that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for the color. And then JB, maybe a question for you on capital. So, the slides note that you don't
expect to repurchase any shares here. And given slower than last year's balance sheet growth, I think it's pretty
clear you're going to build capital this year. So maybe can you just talk about given the uncertainty in the
environment where you'd like to run capital ratios at and then maybe what would it take for you to turn
repurchases for the company back on? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Ryan. So, it's kind of we alluded to we're close to sort of running at our internal target which is 9%-
ish. And so we've been aggressive buyers of the shares, got ourselves paying a reasonable dividend today. I
think just in light of what a fluid environment, dynamic environment, challenging, whatever you want to call it, we
think the prudent thing right now is not to plan for incremental buybacks. But to the extent we get clarity, to the
extent whatever we head into and it becomes a mild recession and we start generating incremental capital, I think
we'd look to restart the buyback program at some point in the future.
And so that was – using that word currently was very much by design. I mean I think what we see today, the
prudent thing is to not plan for it. But, look, I think we've shown we are aggressive buyers of our shares when we
feel they're undervalued and we certainly would say that today. And so to the extent we get more and better
clarity, it would not be unreasonable to assume we begin again.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Thanks. Good morning. Your presentation materials go a long way towards addressing some of the major
debates on your stock, so let me add my thanks. I wanted to follow up on your credit comments. Based on what
you see today, would you expect NCOs to peak in 2023 or could we see peak NCOs going out until 2024? And
when should we expect the reserve rate to start to drift lower in relation to those peak losses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Brown A
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yes. Hey. Good morning, Bill. Sure. So, I think the slide that we added that shows sort of that expected trajectory
in 2023 is a great reference point. And you'll see kind of at most – the biggest delta in sort of our normalized view
versus 2023 expectations really is in the fourth quarter. And so that's where the unemployment rate, as I said, is
peaking, cresting, as well as that working through some of the other dynamics we mentioned in terms of just when
you think about the content of new originations as well, the vintage, the dynamic that I mentioned which is really
working through that late 2021, early 2022 cohorts where we expect that to be down to less than a quarter of the
book by the fourth quarter.
So I think that that – and also kind of continuing what we've guided to previously around our decline in used
vehicle values, it will kind of get us to that high point of the 4Q 2023. Now, if things worsen or things change from
here, I mean variables, as I mentioned, are moving quickly and certainly hard to predict, but we see that there
could be some of that elevation going into 2024 but really feel like given all of those dynamics that that should be
around the top of peak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And separately I did want to also ask if you could give some color on the decision to provide concrete
expense guidance and speak to the concerns that 2024 is a long way away and you may be limiting your
flexibility. Why not go with more of an efficiency ratio that gives you the ability to potentially manage expenses for
the revenue environment. Just any kind of color and the thought process that you all went through there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, Bill, what I would say is, look, across the enterprise, we embrace this essentialism mindset which is
disciplined pursuit of less. There are a number of the items that are sort of non-controllable that I think Brad
pointed out, FDIC fees being a big driver. The Insurance line item creates a decent size pop in your headline
expense number. But as Brad mentioned in his prepared remarks that's the direct offset in revenues there.
And so then when you get into kind of a controllable space, you got a number of 1% to 2% which we think in light
of the environment is pretty reasonable. I mean as I talked to other CEOs in financial services, I think everyone's
kind of grappling with higher people cost and human capital cost and so we're trying to manage through that.
What I would say is as an enterprise in the end of the summer last year, we more or less hit the pause on hiring.
You've seen other financials do that as well. I would say there are some special exceptions to that new talent,
entry-level talent. You want to continue to build a pipeline and allow those people to come into the company, that
doesn't end up being a big driver of expenses but we've added to the head count there.
And then with respect to the technology space and cyber space and things like that, we think these are areas
where you have to constantly invest in. And we think it's kind of interesting what's going on in the world of
technology, more layoff announcements throughout this week, more this morning, and that may provide us an
opportunity to bring in incremental talent. So all these things kind of balance out the way we're thinking through. I

mean we recognize revenues, as Brad talked about are going to be pressured in the near-term. But I think our
focus is trying to create that right balance for the long run and I think what we've done in hiring has been very
responsible and very disciplined and what I think our long-term holders would expect us to be doing. But I mean
I'd start with there is a big essentialism push to drive efficiencies wherever we can.

Hi. Good morning.

Bradley Brown A
Corporate Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two questions. One, just wanted to dig in a little bit on the guide for how you're thinking about the OSA rate and
the NIM and all that. And I know that you indicated there were several different scenarios and a range of potential
outcomes. So can you help us understand how you're thinking about working through the scenario where perhaps
OSA rate becomes a little more competitive than what you're baking into the baseline that you've got here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Betsy, I'll start and Brad feel free to dive in. So what I would say certainly the direct bank market has been
hyper-competitive as of late. I think there's a bigger thirst for deposits. So we take the point I think where we're
priced at right now at 3.3% on OSA, is in-line with what I would say are other kind of top-name direct banks and
big banks and so we're kind of right in-line with the pack. There are certain names that are priced higher than us
and we're not seeing big outflows. And so all this ends up being kind of a balancing act on the competitive
environment and the rate environment.
I think the guide that Brad tried to point out is I mean I think most of the universe is starting to think that the Fed is
getting closer to being done, maybe there's another 50 basis points to go and obviously I mean we're at 3.3%
today. Brad has shown you a scenario where you're going up 45 basis points against maybe a 50-basis point
move. So, it's kind of like a 90% beta. That feels pretty darn aggressive to me. So, it is about [indiscernible]
(01:01:02). That's why we try to add the transparency about what you're assuming on the Fed funds rate.
Everyone can kind of do their own math if they think it would go higher. But the nice thing I would say in talking to
our Deposit leader, Anand Talwar; and our Bank leader, Diane Morais, they would say things had kind of felt a
little bit more stable here the past three, four weeks. So we think there's more to go but I don't think it's another
kind of 100 basis points from here.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, separately, same kind of theme, how should we think about the impact on loss rates if
used car prices fall more sharply than what you have baked in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean obviously they go up to some degree. But I think there are a couple of dynamics at play. First, if you
look at other industry experts and big names that are out there, they are more modest in the declines that they've
projected. I think we've been pretty consistent in saying end of 2021 to the end of 2023 would be this 30%-ish
types of line. We saw a little more than that last year. But as Brad has shown you, you've got probably 13 basis
points of decline embedded here.
I think the other factor and what's out there is there were about 11 million less cars produced over the past sort of
three years. And so we think that provides some structural support. We always try to take a more conservative
view. But I mean the way I would think about the range of risk is maybe if another 5% decline in used car prices
and that would represent kind of a couple basis points of incremental NCO. So, it's fairly well in there. Yes. Could
it be worse? But we think that's probably a little bit unlikely from here.
