MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name
is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone
lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.

Dana W. Nolan
Executive Vice President & Head of Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' second quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high
level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward- looking statement
disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These
disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, we're very
pleased with our quarterly results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $558 million, resulting in earnings
per share of $0.59.
And importantly, our second quarter adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income represents the company's highest
level on record. We continue to successfully execute our strategic plan and delivered strong results. Sentiment
among our business customers today is cautiously optimistic. They're rebuilding inventories and looking for
opportunities to expand their businesses. Loan commitments and pipelines remain strong and utilization rates
continue to increase.
The consumer remains healthy. Net population migration inflows into our markets remain robust, and majority of
our footprint has returned to equal or better than pre-pandemic employment levels. In fact, unemployment rates in
six of our top eight deposit markets are essentially at all-time lows. Today, broad segments of consumers still
maintain substantial cushion in their deposit accounts. For example, consumers with less than $1,000 on average
in their checking accounts prior to the pandemic are averaging a balance today that remains approximately six
times higher than pre-pandemic levels.
Overall asset quality remained strong during the quarter, with most metrics remaining substantially better than
historical levels. However, we'll continue to closely monitor early warning indicators for any signs of deterioration.
Our capital ratios remain strong. And in fact, earlier this week, our board approved an 18% increase to our
common stock dividend to $0.20 per share. We have a strong balance sheet, deliberately positioned to withstand
an array of economic conditions.
Investments we're making across our businesses are continuing to pay off. In the Corporate Bank, we continue to
invest in talent, technology and strategic acquisitions to expand our products, capabilities and expertise.

Excluding acquisitions, we have added over 200 new positions in the Corporate Bank since 2019, with
approximately 85% in revenue-generating or supporting roles.
Our most recent acquisitions, Sabal Capital Partners and Clearsight Advisors, are contributing to overall capital
markets revenue growth in 2022. We're also strengthening our credit product capabilities for small businesses.
Ascentium Capital is exceeding our expectations as provider of essential equipment financing. We recently
restructured our SBA organization and continued to invest in key talent to build out our non-restaurant franchise
lending division, positioning Regions as a trusted resource for franchisees within our footprint.
We've been investing in our Treasury Management and payments business for several years and are
experiencing strong revenue growth. Today, we offer a comprehensive and competitive suite of solutions
positioned to meet the complex needs of any client. We continue to invest in these businesses, rolling out new
products and enhancements across our Treasury platform, including real-time payments and fraud mitigation as
well as APIs and new cash flow analysis tools.
Within the Consumer Bank, we continue to make advancements to become the premier lender to homeowners. In
recent years, we've expanded our mortgage loan origination team, upgraded our mortgage contact relationship
management platform, and continued to simplify the overall sales process.
We also continued to invest in our mortgage servicing portfolio. Year-to-date, we've completed bulk purchases for
the rights to service approximately $13 billion in mortgage loans. EnerBank, a leader in the prime and super prime
home improvement point-of-sale space helps us meet customer needs while generating quality asset growth.
Within Wealth Management, we continue to invest in talent and technology to optimize the client and associate
experience. Since 2019, we've added 44 new revenue-generating positions in our Wealth Group, primarily in
Private Wealth Management and Investment Services.
Last month, we launched our digital investing product, which combines the ease of a self-directed digital tool with
the option of support from a financial advisor. These investments contributed to a strong performance in the first
half of 2022.
So, wrapping up, we have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team, and a proven track record of successful
execution. While sentiment across both business and consumers remains generally positive, we will continue to
monitor our portfolios for indicators of stress. We have a robust credit risk management framework and a
disciplined, dynamic approach to managing concentration risk, which has positioned us well to weather any
economic environment and continue to deliver consistent, sustainable, long-term performance.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 3% while ending loans grew 5% during
the quarter. Average business loans increased 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across all businesses and
industries. A majority of the growth this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit
lines to rebuild inventories and to expand their businesses. While still below pre-pandemic levels, commercial line
utilization ended the quarter at approximately 44.4%, increasing 50 basis points over the prior quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Loan production also remained strong with linked-quarter commitments up approximately $5.5 billion. Importantly,
digging into this commercial loan growth, we're maintaining a very high asset quality portfolio. In fact, balances
considered investment-grade equivalent are up 30% compared to a year ago. And approximately 44% of our total
commitments are also considered investment-grade equivalent, representing its highest level on record.
Similarly, our overall probability of default in this portfolio has improved approximately 35 basis points since mid of
2019. Average consumer loans remained relatively stable, while ending loans increased 3%. Growth in average
mortgage and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories. Within other consumer, EnerBank loans
grew approximately 7% compared to the first quarter.
As a reminder, EnerBank has a track record of well-controlled loss rates throughout multiple cycles and primarily
originates prime and super prime loans to homeowners who tend to be lower-risk borrowers. Looking forward, we
currently expect to hold total loans relatively stable over the remainder of the year, which would result in full year
2022 average loan growth of approximately 8% compared to 2021. This assumes a slowing rate of growth
compared to the second quarter, but also assumes increased capital markets activity in the back half of the year.
So, let's turn to deposits. Deposit balances acquired throughout the pandemic remain mostly stable early in the
Fed's tightening cycle. Importantly, seasonal patterns related primarily to income tax payments returned to those
experienced prior to the pandemic. While average deposit balances grew, ending balances declined.
Ending Consumer deposits were mostly stable, while Corporate and Wealth Management balances decreased
approximately $1 billion each. In addition to seasonal patterns, and in line with our expectations, the declines also
include certain commercial and wealth clients beginning to reduce some of their excess balances.
We continue to expect a range of $5 billion to $10 billion of overall balance reduction for the full year of 2022,
resulting from tightening monetary policy. The combination of our legacy deposit base, along with the more stable
components of surge deposits, represents a significant opportunity for us as rates continue to increase.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income grew $93 million or 9% linked quarter,
evidencing strong balance sheet growth and asset sensitivity in a rising interest rate environment. Cash averaged
$22 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduced second quarter's reported margin by 38
basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.44%.
The reduction in cash this quarter resulted mostly from strong asset growth, both loans and securities, as well as
seasonal deposit outflows. Average loan balances grew $2.9 billion, or 3% in the second quarter. Additionally,
$1.2 billion of securities were added. The recent increase in rates have certainly validated our decision to wait on
a better rate environment to deploy cash into securities. While not included in our current outlook, additional
security purchases would provide incremental benefit.
The primary driver of net interest income growth this quarter was higher interest rates and our decision to remain
exposed to rates in the near term. Importantly, deposit balance and yield outperformance, including a 5% cycle to
date deposit beta allowed net interest income to grow by more than our previous guidance. Total net interest
income is projected to increase 8% to 10% in the third quarter as expectations for rate hikes have been pulled
forward, so has our outlook for NII. Fourth quarter net interest income is now expected to be approximately 23%
to 25% higher than our first quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Regions' balance sheet remains well-positioned to benefit from continuing increases in interest rates. Incremental
25-basis-point increases in the Fed funds rate are projected to add between $40 million and $60 million over a full
12-month period, as deposit betas are projected to increase into the 25% to 35% range.
This NII benefit is supported by a large portion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning
assets held in cash, which compares favorably to the industry overall. Over a longer horizon, a more normal
interest rate environment, or roughly a 2.5% to 3% Fed funds rate will support a net interest margin range of
approximately 3.75% to 3.8%. This target incorporates the execution of recent hedging activity at higher rate
levels than originally contemplated.
While we have purposefully retained leverage to the higher interest rates during a period of low rates, we have
begun to manage to a more normal interest rate risk profile as the interest rate environment normalizes. This
includes the addition of $8.3 billion of forward starting receive fix swaps and a $1.2 billion of spot starting
securities during the quarter.
Through the first half of 2022, we have added $15 billion of swaps and securities. The swaps become effective in
the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and have a term of generally three years. This represents approximately 75% of
the total hedging amount expected this cycle. With the sizable amount of hedging complete, we will balance
market rate levels and potential risk as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program.
Now, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 10% from the prior
quarter, primarily due to improvement in capital markets and card and ATM fees. Within capital markets, growth
was driven by higher fees and M&A advisory and real estate loan syndications as well as a $20 million benefit
from CVA and DVA. We continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110
million, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA.
While we expect to be on the lower end of the range next quarter, we do anticipate activity will pick up in the
coming quarters. Card and ATM fees reflect seasonally higher interchange on both debit and credit cards. Spend
was up 3% year-over-year as inflation has impacted several categories, including a 30% increase in fuel, while
discretionary categories such as retail goods, department stores, and apparel are actually down.
Mortgage and wealth management income remained relatively stable during the quarter despite unfavorable
conditions. Seasonally higher mortgage production overcame first quarter gains associated with the sale of
previously repurchased Ginnie Mae loans. While we anticipate a decline in mortgage income relative to 2021,
mortgage as well as wealth management will remain key contributors to our overall fee revenue.
Service charges declined during the quarter as seasonal increases were offset by NSF and overdraft policy
changes. The second phase of previously announced NSF and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end
of the second quarter, and the remaining changes will be implemented in the third quarter. These changes, when
combined with previously implemented changes, are expected to result in full year 2022 service charges of
approximately $600 million.
We also expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in 2023, and now, expect full year 2023 service
charges of approximately $550 million. We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 7.5% to 8.5% compared
to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in net interest income. This growth includes the impact of lower PPP-
related revenue and the anticipated impact of NSF and overdraft changes.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 2% compared to the prior
quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 5%, primarily due to annual merit increases, which became effective on
April 1. Higher variable-based and incentive compensation associated with increased financial performance and
better credit experience, as well as one additional workday in the quarter. These increases were partially offset by
a decrease in payroll taxes and lower HR asset valuations.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses, while investing in technology, products and people to grow our
business. As a result, our core expense base will grow. We expect 2022 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up
4.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full year impact of recent acquisitions as well as
anticipated inflationary impacts. With the changes in revenue and expense guidance, we expect to generate
positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 3% in 2022.
Overall, credit performance remained strong. Annualized net charge-offs decreased 4 basis points to 17 basis
points. Non-performing loans increased modestly during the quarter, but remained below pre-pandemic levels at
39 basis points of total loans. While business services criticized loans and total delinquencies continue to
improve. Provision expense was $60 million this quarter and included a modest build to our allowance for credit
losses attributable primarily to strong loan growth, and to a limited degree, general macroeconomic uncertainty,
as well as some early signs of normalization within select commercial sectors.
Our allowance for credit loss ratio is 1.62% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of non-performing
loans remains very strong at 410%. Our annualized year-to-date net charge-off ratio is 19 basis points. Given
increasing expectations for a slowing economy, combined with inevitable normalization, we are maintaining our
full year net charge-off expectations in the 20 to 30-basis-point range, but currently expect to be towards the lower
end.
Based on the recent stress test results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter of
2022 through the third quarter of 2023 is expected to remain at 2.5% once our supervisory results are confirmed
in August of 2022.
We ended the quarter with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.2%, reflecting continued strong loan
growth, particularly during the last week of the quarter. And while loan growth remains our top priority for capital
deployment, we expect to manage to the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over time. Also, as
John mentioned, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.20 per share, an 18%
increase over the prior quarter, which reflects strong earnings growth.
So, wrapping up on the next slide, our updated 2022 expectations, which we've already addressed, in closing, we
have delivered strong year-to-date performance despite volatile economic conditions. We will continue to be a
source of stability to our customers, but also remain vigilant with respect to any indicators of potential market
contraction. Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit risk is relatively
benign and capital and liquidity are solid.
With that, we're happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start off on the net interest income. Just based on the guidance, it looks like
it's going to end the year about $1.26 billion. So, the question is, if the Fed were to stop raising rates at year end,
it seems like you have a lot of strong momentum for growth into next year. Could you just talk about some of the
big picture trends that you see for next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure, Peter, this is David. So, we do have an expectation that Fed continues to raise rates, probably
finishing the year in a 3.25% to 3.50% range. And they could go past that. They could stay there for a while. We
do believe there's risk that the economy slows to a point where they have to become more accommodative in the
latter part of 2023 and 2024, hence why you started to see us place some forward starting swaps in those
positions to protect us to the extent that that happens.
Clearly, rates could not come down and they may stay flat or go even higher. But at that point, we're generating
the kind of NIM that we talked about that's on our slide, I don't have the page number, but a very strong net
interest margin, and more importantly, a very good return on tangible common equity profile. So, the benefit is
through our deposit base. We think we're going to continue to have a lower beta through the cycle than our peers.
It may be higher than last time for everybody, but nonetheless, we think that's our competitive advantage, even if
the Fed stops at year end without any further increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just as a follow-up, just could you give a little bit more color on the loan growth guidance in the
second half of the year with it slowing? It just surprised given the momentum on the period-end basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So, one, we have to acknowledge we had pretty strong loan growth. I think the industry had pretty good
loan growth in the first quarter. Obviously, things are slowing down a bit. We think we're going to have a lot of
opportunity to grow. But this is when you need to be very cautious, very careful, and make sure your client
selectivity is robust and ensure that you get paid for the risks that you're taking. And so, we may be a little
conservative in terms of our loan balances from here on out.
What we wanted to make sure is we don't want to send the message that we're going to grow at the pace we just
did the first quarter. We don't think that would be appropriate for us. We still see good demand in a lot of sectors;
financial services, utilities, wholesale durables, just to name – and elements of transportation are strong. And we
think even in investor real estate, there are some places that we've been able to grow in the multifamily sector in
8

particular, as well as in the – in industrial area. So, I think it's a bit of cautious tone is all we're sending and we will
grow as the market gives us permission with the right metrics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Peter, this is John. The other thing I would add is that all the volatility has obviously created disruption in the
capital markets. And so, we've seen, particularly our larger customers rely on the pro rata bank market for
funding. At some point, we expect a little more clarity about the path of the economy.
And so, we believe that what is pent-up demand amongst issuers will – they'll begin to access the capital markets
again, which will result in some pay-downs in some of the larger credit exposure that we have enjoyed over the
last two or three quarters. So, that is part of our projection as well. And as David said, it may be a conservative
point of view, but we believe it will happen at some point in the next few quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

with your question.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess, David, just following up on your comment around the margin. I think you mentioned, if I
heard you correctly, a 3.75% to 3.80% normalized margin for Regions. One, I mean, if you could tell us like what
the Fed funds needs to get to in order for you to get to that level for the net interest margin. And once we get
there, based on the hedging strategy that you have, what you've laid out, do you think that becomes something
that's relatively stable absent a big change in the rate backdrop and obviously the protection that you have on the
downside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So, if you look at our slide deck on page 8, we try to lay that out. That gives you at least some parameters
on where we think the margin could be in different scenarios. So, if the Fed's going to get close to 3% at the end
of the day and stay there for a while, we think we can have a margin profile that's in that 3.80% range.
And if the Fed doesn't move any further or doesn't reverse course and come back the other way, that's probably
where we'll be. If the Fed starts to come the other way, our margin will decline some, but we think we can protect.

Regions Financial Corp.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Today, we can protect about 3.60% as rates continue to move up and we finish our hedging program, we're about
three quarters of the way through, and we have another 25% to do. If we're patient enough, and we kind of
understand where the economy is going, perhaps we can lock in a downside protection a bit higher than the
3.60%, and that's really what our goal is. And we think 3.60% is a great level today, but can we get another few
basis points on top of that if we're patient? We think so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I think, just tied to that, you mentioned, deposit betas for this – the core customer base could
be higher relative to the last cycle. I'm wondering if anything that you've seen so far in the last two to four weeks
that would imply that customers' conversations around higher rates have picked up and you could actually see a
higher beta this cycle versus last.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, so the answer to that is no. We've been a bit surprised, frankly, on both betas, as well as balances but – for
the industry, so our beta, cumulative beta thus far is 5%. We're one of the lowest peer group I think as the median
is about double that. So, I – we keep calling for deposit balances to decline some $5 billion to $10 billion. The
largest contributor of that would be corporate deposits that are going, we believe, in time, seek a higher return.
We are starting to see that pick up a bit.
Again, we're surprised that it hadn't moved quicker, but if Fed moved 75 basis points in their next move in
September, yeah, in September – I'm sorry, at the end of – end of July, this month, and an expectation of another
50 in September, then we think those balances will start to move off balance sheet. And frankly we're going to
help facilitate that for our customers because we can earn a little bit of a fee on that and give them a better return
today. That's happened some already.
So, if you look at corporate customers, they actually have either deposit balances with us or off balance sheet that
we've helped facilitate and if you add those two together, actually a little higher than they were at year-end. So,
we've been pleased with our deposit base and our betas thus far.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. You've all proven yourselves to be astute managers of risk. I'd love to
hear how you're thinking about the risk that the strength we continue to see in labor markets and you mentioned
the balances in consumer accounts and strong liquidity and spending in general, and to the extent to which all of
that is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the Fed to have to do more.
So, everything seems great now but we all know the hiking cycle works on a significant lag and we could see
unemployment continue to rise well after the last Fed hike and we've started to see initial claims creep up a little
bit. So, maybe if you could just reinforce how that dynamic, even though you're not seeing it at the micro level yet,
perhaps how that, if at all, impacts the actions that you're taking today across the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Bill, it's a great question. And it's one we challenge ourselves with constantly as a team. In our discussions
with others in the industry, including our regulatory supervisors and the Fed in particular, about where they really
want to go, I think we all believe there's an expectation of getting to "neutral" as fast as they can is what they
would like to do. But I think every time there's a move, there's a need to pause and see what impact that's going
to have on the economy. We do have inflation that can get addressed by slowing the economy down, which is
taking effect now. But as much as they want to get "to neutral" that I don't think the Fed wants to wreck the
economy either.
So, what we're trying to do is read all the tea leaves, look at all the data that we can, study our customers,
whether it be consumers or corporate customers, to try and get an understanding of what they're thinking, how
their business is, how they're managing their personal money, to gather an understanding of the slowdown in the
economy and what the Fed may or may not do. We believe that the Fed's going to get to 3.25% to 3.50% by the
end of the year. Don't know if they'll move exactly like the market thinks, but we think that's going to be a place
where they likely stop and let things play out over time. But we have to be prepared for them to keep going.
And if that's the case, because inflation is not under control, there could be some ramifications to that long term,
which is why we're cautious on extending credit while we want to manage our bank as efficiently as we can.
Because you have to have scenarios for anything that could possibly happen as we seek to continue to have
appropriate returns on capital to our shareholders.

That's great color and very helpful response. Thank you. If I may follow up on EnerBank, can you remind us how
growth math dynamics impact EnerBank? What's the interplay between the need to build reserves and the strong
loan growth that you're seeing versus the timing of the revenue benefits? And then, more broadly, if you could
also speak to the trajectory of the reserve rate from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Okay. I'll start on EnerBank. So, EnerBank, we said represented 1% of an industry that was about $175 billion.
So, call that $1.7 billion of annual production for them that generates growth in the double digits. We've seen that
play out. We don't think about the provisioning getting ahead of the earnings, because if we did that, we would not
make any loans ever. That's why it's a terrible standard. But I won't go into that. It is what it is.

So, what we want to do is be there for our clients to extend credit regards to the fact that we have to set up a
reserve in advance. So, then come into play, we've had nice growth with EnerBank, and very excited about that.
Get paid for the risk we're taking. And it's worked exactly like we thought it would be.

his question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, primarily, the – you've got carry, you've got net interest income as the biggest driver of our profitability
there. And it comes in two fronts. It comes from the customer paying a certain rate and there's a discount from the
vendor that's providing the service to the customer, an HVAC contractor for instance. We take those two pieces
and that's our yield adjustment. Now, that's – should average in the 9% range over time. And that's the primary
profitability that you'll see from EnerBank.

That's very helpful. And the broader trajectory of the reserve rate from here that we should be thinking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we set the reserves under CECL based on the economic forecast at each quarter end. We have to look
out through the life of the loan to do that. We have a reserve of 1.62%. We think it's very robust. And based on the
risk that we see in the portfolio, we feel very good about that.
The biggest driver of the increase in our reserves this quarter, by far, was loan growth. And so, we aren't seeing
broad-based deterioration in credit at all. As a matter of fact, we think it's actually pretty good. We did have an
increase in NPLs primarily attributable to one particular customer. But overall, we feel really good about credit.
We do think there's going to be some normalization. I mean, we're at 17 basis points of charge-offs this quarter.
That's lower than "normal". And we think over time, it will get back to normal. I don't know that it will get there in
2022. We're forecasting charge-offs in the range of 20 to 30 basis points and actually towards the lower end of
that.
2023, you could see losses pick up as the economy slows as certain industries start to struggle a bit more than
others. And I think you'll see it manifest itself first in, really, small businesses that'll have bigger challenges than a
larger business and certain consumer groups might struggle more than others.

Good morning, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi John. How are you? Hi David. David, can you elaborate a little further on your comments about the capital
market fees that you expect to be at the lower end of the range? I think you said in your prepared comments in
the upcoming quarter. What type of capital markets environment are you contemplating for that kind of guidance?
Is it currently what we just had this quarter or is it an improvement? And then within the capital markets,
obviously, you guys are not ECM players. Where are you seeing or you think you're going to see the strength in
the upcoming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that, so, we were – if you cut out the CVA/DVA, we're kind of at the lower end of the range. We think
that that's kind of where we'll be here, at least, in the short term. Capital markets activity is not as robust. I think
you've seen that play out across the board, in particular in the money center banks that have more ECM.
Obviously, we don't have that.
M&A advisory and loan syndications are the places, where we think can continue to be robust for us. And I wish
we were going to be at the upper end of that range. We've had to revise that down from the beginning of the year
a couple of times. But we think that's a pretty good – really good place to be. Real estate capital markets and
leveraging our Sabal Capital Partners that we bought at the end of last year, I think is helping us. And – but I think
we would be remiss if we didn't say that's going to be a little more challenging than we would had hoped just
because the capital markets aren't quite where we all would like them to be at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question to your comments about the lending, the strength of your lending
and how you recognize and you guys are very well experienced in handling problems that from the downturn in
2008, 2009. So, nobody expects you to make any errors like that.
But can you share with us what are you – I think you used the word robust in client selection. What are you doing
at the – if we are in an end-of-the-cycle in the economy, and that's debatable, of course, but when you see the
growth, not just for you, but for the industry, everybody is showing good loan growth toward the end of – maybe
as economic expansion, how can you reassure us that you guys are – got metrics in place that you just won't
really have the problems that can be – that other banks may run into?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gerard, this is John. We learned a lot from that 2009-2010 sort of timeframe and particularly the
importance of balance and diversity. These are good times, but you can make your worst loans in the best of
times. And so, we're being very thoughtful about what we're putting on the books. 83% of our new production was
to existing customers. We've been working very closely with those customers, particularly over the last two-and-a-
half years, as we worked through the pandemic. I think we have a really good sense of what's going on in their
businesses.

We have been focused, as you know, for a number of years on recycling capital, on risk-adjusted returns. We've
been exiting certain portfolios and relationships that didn't generate an appropriate return on capital for us. I think
that's great. Discipline that exists within the company, we have strong metrics and key performance indicators
built around all of our businesses and, again, really dedication to a strong concentration methodology to ensure
that we have good balance and diversity.
We assume a variety of different scenarios when stress testing credits and stress testing portfolios. And as a
result, we feel good about – really good about the credit risk management culture that we have developed over
time and think that our portfolios will perform well no matter what the economic conditions or how the economic
conditions evolve.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, John. Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Hey, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
David, you talked about the $5 billion to $10 billion of potential deposit outflow starting to pick up. And, if we were
to assume they exit over the next quarter or so, can you maybe just talk about your expectations for deposit
growth? And given John's comments regarding what you guys think about loan growth in the second half, how do
you think about the tradeoff between growing deposits versus optimizing the mix and the cost of deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
So, the first part of that, we do expect, as I mentioned earlier, those excess deposits from our corporate clients to
seek a better, higher-yielding home. We also have about $1 billion aid in brokered deposits that we picked up
14


Regions Financial Corp.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
from the EnerBank transaction. So, I think that we're always looking for quality relationships, deposit relationships,
Treasury Management relationships. We were able to grow that 14% this quarter in Treasury Management. So,
we're excited about that.
And I think that from a consumer standpoint, we're in a good part of the country, where ought to see better
migration of people into our footprint and take – and we should be able to take advantage of that. So, we should
be able to continue to grow core checking accounts. We do have, obviously, inflationary pressures on consumers.
We – I think we've put in our slide deck that we've even looked at – segmented our deposit base. On the
consumer side, those that had their $1,000 or less in their checking account pre-pandemic have six times more
cash in their account today than pre-pandemic.
Now, that's going to start declining if inflation continues at a faster clip. But continuing to grow customers ought to
help us maintain pretty solid deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is among the lowest in the peer group at 67%
change, may be close to 68%. And so, we're optimizing our deposit book. We're growing deposits as foundational
to how we make money. And so, we are even remotely close to having to worry about wholesale funding. There
are some of our peers that had to dip into that because of loan-to-deposit ratio. But this is where Regions shines.
This is our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And we're looking to continue to grow that and grow
customers and take care of our customers along the way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And then second, David, you're targeting 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. And I know it's
early to think about 2023. But maybe just to follow up on Peter's question from earlier, if you think about just
reaching the NII run rate and assuming no further growth, that would give you about 8% revenue growth into next
year. So, how do you think about investing? And this obviously is a tricky environment with the potential for an
economic slowdown. But do you expect that we could potentially see accelerating positive operating leverage in
that type of environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think you answered that question upfront. It's a little early to get into 2023. But let me help you here. We
have a continuous improvement program where we are constantly focusing on how to get better at what we do.
We had a pretty strong efficiency ratio this quarter of, call it, 54% on an adjusted basis. We'd like that to be lower.
We're substantially below the median, which is 400 basis points higher than we are. And I think that at the end of
the day, if we could get closer to 50% that would be great.
And we're going to figure out how to try and do that. We cannot count on revenue growth just being the only driver
of how we continue to be efficient. So, if we stay focused on that, Ryan, I think we can generate pretty solid,
positive operating leverage.
Now, there's a caveat. We have to continue to take our winnings, if you will, and reinvest those in our company to
grow. That means we have to reinvest in talent. We have to reinvest in technology. We will reinvest in our
transformation that we're going to go through on the deposit side primarily and other areas. And we do that while
continuing to control our cost increases, which I told you earlier in the year, the vast majority of our increase early
in the year was really related to acquisitions. So, we're – we've been a good expense managers and I think you'll
see that continue into 2023.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. And Dana, great job on slide 8, by the way. Yeah, David, I wanted to go back to slide 8. Can you
[audio gap] (00:47:11) what your plans are for securities book, your cash balances from here. Obviously, [ph] if
IOER continues (00:47:19) [indiscernible] (00:47:20) to Fed funds, your cash is going to be working a lot harder
by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I'm glad you pointed that out. That's 100% beta on that opportunity there. We're at 1.65% on reserves.
We've been patient with our cash. We didn't need to put it in the securities book to help NII. We had the benefit of
our hedging program doing that for us. So, we have been patient. We're glad we have. We put a little bit to work in
the securities book because the spreads got to a point where it was – we were paid for the duration that we were
going to take. And that securities investment is really part of our hedging program as well.
We were able to use our cash this quarter to fund all of our loan growth. I think we're down to, call it, $18 billion of
cash at the end of the quarter. And normally, that number is going to be $500 million to $2 billion worth of cash at
the Fed. So, we've got some of that that we need to hold on to for that deposit outflow that I just talked about,
whether it's the corporate deposits or whether it's the EnerBank-brokered deposits that we'll lead over time. And
16


Regions Financial Corp.

then, we'll have some for loan growth. So, we don't see the need to tap into our alternative sources of funding,
FHLB and the like, or certainly, no bank debt issuances are necessary either at this time.
So, we've been cautious. It's paid off for us. I think, the securities we invested this quarter yielding [ph] a 3.30-ish
(00:49:06) range. So – and as you could see that in the change in tangible common equity in terms of our decline
was much lower than our peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, I just wanted to make sure we're taking away the right message here. From second quarter NIM 3.06%, and
hit a net interest margin of 3.70% to 3.80%, right, from low – higher beta to base case at a Fed funds rate of 3%.
And if the Fed starts cutting rates, your swap program has protected you to 3.60%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And my other question for you, David, is if we were to prepare for [ph] a mild recession (00:50:03), how
should we think about how [audio gap] (00:50:06) more ACL builds there may need to be from that 1.62%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
So, you cut out on the first part of that, but I think your question was how do we see the reserve build from here
from 1.62%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
In a mild recession.

Yeah, in a mild recession.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we're having to forecast out through life of loan today, which has elements of a slowdown already built
into it. So, it really is dependent on how severe it is relative to our expectations already. And we kind of went
through that, I guess, in the pandemic. You saw our adjustment quickly.

Right now, we don't see that changing a lot because we think we're covered. And the real change to the
allowance are just two things, whatever charge-offs have, reducing it and then the provision primarily for loan
growth, which is what you saw this quarter. Our credit quality metrics are stable. Net-net, all in, we feel good
about where we are but if the economy starts to slip, and we're going to have to have higher provisioning going
forward.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just two quick close-outs here. Just one question, David, on the C&I loan yields, just
not up as much, of course, as the NIM. And I'm sure some of that is the hedging. Just wondering if you can kind of
just help us understand how much of that is the hedging impact, and how much of that might just be mix and
pricing, et cetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would say most of that is related to hedging. Our old hedges that we had protecting us, those start to roll
off. We have some still protecting us that they are still in place, so we're not expanding it quite to pace that maybe
others that didn't hedge are. But we still have pretty good loan yields net-net. And if you look at adjusted net
interest income, that's after charge-offs, we're one of the leaders in the peer group. So, that's a good indicator
telling us we're being paid for the credit risk that we're taking.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then on capital, 9.2% CET1, you're mentioning you want to get back to the middle of the
9.25% to 9.75% and presuming that's to give room for loan growth. Just wondering, obviously, that probably
implies that no buybacks for now. Can you just talk us through capital return expectations versus RWA? And then
also just – is it just a little bit more conservatism about the environment? All right. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, the reason we want to be in that range is to give us flexibility to make investments when we see
opportunities. In this particular quarter, it was loan growth. So, we had really robust loan growth and you could
see our capital, our Common Equity Tier 1 declined. The primary use of that was in fact RWA growth through the
loans. We're generating, call it, 50 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1 each quarter or at least we did this past
quarter, and we'll use a third of that to pay a dividend and then the rest of it's for investment.
First off, it's for loan growth. We've already sent the message that we don't expect loan growth at the pace we just
saw the first quarter. We think that'll level off a bit and, therefore, we can accrete back from the 9.2% where we
are, closer to the 9.5%, probably can't get there at the end of the third quarter, take us into the fourth quarter. But
we use share repurchases as the last item to control our capital level. We think 9% – that 9.25%, 9.75% still is a
great range for us based on the risk we see in our book, taking into account all the macro factors that exist today.
So, you'll see us accrete up – back up towards that 9.50% before we get into share repurchases.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Two questions, one on the securities book, I know we just had a bit of a chat on that, but I wanted to
understand what the kind of repricing speed is? Duration? Like how quickly should we be thinking about the back
book migrating to the front book of 3.3% that you just talked about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, if you look at all-in gross, so the 3.3% I just mentioned was an element of what we invested primarily as part
of our hedging program. We did have other security purchases. So, all-in yield going on was about 3.13%. That's
replacing 2.23%. So, we're picking up about 90 points on that. As we think about duration, we're looking at, call it,
right at five years today. And we don't think that extends a whole lot on us based on what we're buying. So, I think
that – I think I got what you wanted, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. And then, on page 22 of the deck, you have your base R&S economic outlook. So, is this giving us the
base case? And then, you've got a probability assigned to the base case, you've got a probability assigned to the
bull and the bear, and that's what's feeding into the CECL reserve analysis, or would you say this page 22
discloses your probability-weighted scenario?

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Morning. Just a clarification, David, do you expect your liquid assets to actually go down to $750 million? Because
you're obviously much higher today...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. No...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...but is that realistic or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
No, I was saying hypothetically in normal times, we could take those down, that cash down to a level much lower
than the $18 billion that we're having, that we have today. And that would be over time. So, we wouldn't seek to
get there any time soon. We want to maintain a lot of liquidity to take care of deposit flows because remember, we
had some $40 billion worth of growth and, what we're calling surge deposits, and we've made our best estimate
as to how we think those things will behave over time. And we have about $13 billion, $14 billion of it that we think
has either a very high beta or it's going to seek a better alternative, which means we need to have the cash to pay
for that if it starts to happen. But yeah, in normal times, we could be down in that – I've said somewhere between
$500 million to $2 billion and of course then we'd have the FHLB as our toggle to take care of other liquidity
needs.

John M. Turner, Jr. A

I think David talked about small business. We have some concern around the transportation, particularly on the
lower end of the sector, where you have transportation companies who are involved in less than truckload hauling
and the impact of diesel fuel inflationary cost labor. We have been following office for some time and senior
housing as well are portfolios that we're keeping an eye on. I wouldn't say in those two instances that we're
