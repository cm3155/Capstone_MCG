Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. As Natalia mentioned, I'm joined this morning
by our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason, and our Treasurer, Mike Verdeschi. In a moment, Mike will take you
through the Fixed Income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com.
Afterwards, Mark and Mike willing be happy to answer your questions.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in

circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements
due take a variety of factors, including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those
included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.
Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through the presentation, I'd like to make a few comments about the frequency
of the Fixed Income investor reviews going forward. First, I would say that we truly value the engagement of our
Fixed Income investors, both during the Fixed Income investor reviews and outside of the reviews. And while we
feel the investor review calls are a great opportunity for our investors to engage with us in a public forum, at this
point we believe hosting the call two times a year is most appropriate. So going forward, we would envision one
call occurring after fourth quarter earnings and one call after second quarter earnings. However, we would, of
course, host a call outside of this schedule if there are updates that we believe our investors would benefit from.
Again, we value the engagement and do not plan to be any less engaged with our investors, though the nature
and timing of that engagement will continue to evolve.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.

Michael Verdeschi
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly
discuss our 2020 operating results. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends. Third, I'll review our
issuance programs. And finally, I'll discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position.
Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. In 2020, we reported net income of $11.4
billion, even as we increased our reserves by roughly $10 billion under the CECL framework.
On slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars. On this basis,
we have grown our balance sheet by approximately 15% over the last year, as we continued to support our
consumer and institutional clients as they manage through the COVID-19 health crisis while also maintaining a
strong balance sheet.
In the fourth quarter, deposits grew in line with recent trends, with continued momentum in consumer and
continued client engagement in our institutional business. Loans declined, reflecting lower levels of consumer and
corporate activity. Trading-related assets and liabilities grew, reflecting a continuation of heightened client activity
relative to the prior year. And long-term debt increased year over year but decreased sequentially, as we
maintained our robust liquidity profile and optimized our funding, given our strong deposit growth.
Slide 5 presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans
decreased 4% year over year. In our consumer franchise, average loans declined 6% year over year, primarily
reflecting the impact of lower consumer spending in our Cards business and higher payments by customers given
high levels of liquidity due to fiscal stimulus.
In our institutional franchise, average loans decreased 3% year over year. Breaking that down by business,
average loans in Corporate Lending decreased 6% year over year, reflecting net repayments as we continued to
assist our clients in accessing the capital markets. Private Bank loans increased 6%, largely driven by secured
lending to our high net worth clients, including residential real estate lending. TTS loans decreased 10%,
reflecting softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level of spend in commercial cards. And loans
included in Corp/Other continued to decline, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
On slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolios. In ICG, credit quality remained
broadly stable. In the fourth quarter, non-accrual loans declined sequentially to $3.5 billion or 91 basis points of
total loans, reflecting write-offs and repayments across the portfolio. In GCB, credit trends remained broadly
stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the US, lower spending, and the benefits of relief
programs.
While we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trends and the expected impact of
recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out for the first half of 2022, with losses in Asia and
Mexico peaking earlier than in the US. That said, with credit reserves of $27.8 billion, we believe we are well
prepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolios.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars. Total
average deposits increased 19% from the prior-year period, reflecting continued client engagement as well as the
elevated level of liquidity in the system.
Now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide 8. In 2020, we issued approximately $20
billion of parent-level benchmark debt across a variety of tenors, including the issuance of our inaugural $2.5
billion Affordable Housing bonds. So far in 2021, we issued roughly $2.5 billion. Going forward, we'll continue to
maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors, currencies, and structures, as we prudently manage the liquidity
profile of the firm and support our clients.
On slide 9, let me cover our issuance, maturity, and redemption expectations. As I just mentioned, in 2020 we
issued approximately $20 billion of parent benchmark debt with $20 billion of maturities. Looking to 2021, we
expect gross issuance of roughly $15 billion to $20 billion. And we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our
funding through opportunistic redemptions.
On slide 10, we show the composition of all long-term debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, our total long-
term debt declined by approximately $1 billion to $272 billion, as we allowed our bank debt to mature, given
strong deposit growth.
On slide 11, we provide an update of our LCR metrics and drivers. Our average LCR was unchanged at 118%
this quarter.
Turning to slide 12, let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to
11.8%. And our SLRs were 7% and 6.7% for Citigroup and Citibank respectively.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize several key points. In 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings
power and resilience of the franchise. We earned over $11 billion of net income, even as we increased credit
reserves by roughly $10 billion. We maintained a strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 11.8%, 180
basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement, an SLR of 7%, and a surplus above our TLAC
requirement.
And we also maintained a strong liquidity position with an average LCR of 118%, over $970 billion of available
liquidity resources. And we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR [Net Stable Funding Ratio] when the rule is
effective. Our capital and liquidity profile remains strong and well positioned to withstand potential pressure if
economic conditions deteriorate. And we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that
deepen and expand our client relationships and support the broader recovery.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
Before we move on to Q&A, let me touch briefly on LIBOR. As many of you on this call are aware, there have
been some additional developments since the third quarter Fixed Income investor call. Subject to the results of
the IBA [ICE Benchmark Administration] consultation, it appears likely that most US dollar LIBOR tenors will
continue to be published through June 2023. At Citi, while we are continuing to work with our regulators and
various industry working groups, including the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, to ensure our smooth and
timely transition, we do appreciate the flexibility this affords.
With regard to the subset of our preferreds, which we have mentioned on previous calls, while we are continuing
to evaluate alternatives, we don't have any further updates at this time.
And with that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Hima Inguva with Bank of America.

Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for hosting the call, Mark. Good morning again, Mark, Mike, and Tom. I really
appreciate the disclosures and the opportunity to have the dialogue.
I'm going to start off with SLR. So when we are thinking about SLR and how moving from a backstop to being a
binding measure, would that impact the way you think about capital returns? And then in line with what your peers
have commented on, just maybe if you could, give us some color on if you see retaining more equity or maybe
issuing more debt or prefs. And also if you could, please suggest if TLAC would be more binding that SLR in that
case. So if you could kind of help us parse it out, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, Hima. Thanks for the question. Certainly an area of focus, given SLR and TLAC exemption for reserves and
Treasuries are set to expire at the end of 1Q. The short answer is that SLR would not become binding for us, and
so will not impact our capital return or even the prefs at this time.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
For SLR, the exemption is worth roughly 110 basis points. So all things equal, that 7% SLR would come down to
5.9%, so still 90 basis points above our regulatory minimum. And we are assuming continued growth of the
balance sheet, driven by deposits, but that 90 basis points of room gives us an opportunity to continue to grow.
In terms of TLAC, again with the exemption ending at 1Q, a binding constraint would flip from RWA to leverage.
And in leverage, as of 4Q, we have a TLAC surplus of $32 billion. So that exemption is worth roughly $20 billion.
So if it does expire, that surplus comes down from $32 billion down to $12 billion, which is still above our $7 billion
to $8 billion targeted range. So our issuance plans do assume that exemption ends at 1Q. And the issuance plans
also consider the balance sheet growth that we expect to see in supporting our clients. So the impact on TLAC, of
course, is something that we'll be focused on, and hopefully that gives you a sense of the implications.
But taking a step back, just a few other thoughts. The Fed appropriately reintroduced quantitative easing
measures as COVID unfolded early last year. At that time, the QE actions were meant to add liquidity to address
the market dislocation at that time. The Fed, of course, has maintained QE as the markets have even stabilized
and shifted that focus to using the accommodative stance to support employment and inflation goals. The
byproduct of these policy actions is that liquidity in the system has grown and will remain elevated.
So giving you some context, the Fed grew its balance sheet by about $3.2 trillion in 2020, which drove industry
deposit growth of about $2.8 trillion, or a little over 20%. So that kind of deposit growth has implications on
leverage and those key measures such as SLR and the G-SIB score as well. So with monetary policy remaining
accommodative, the exemption of reserves and Treasuries would still very much make sense given where so
much of this liquidity is being deployed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Mike, I'd add one point to that, which is I think, one, we feel good about the ability to continue to return capital, so I
would make that point. And then two, I think the Fed has been, as you described, Mike, very thoughtful and
constructive about providing this relief. And I would hope that they'd give additional consideration around
extending it or even making it permanent, and also taking a look at the G-SIB score, given the amount of liquidity
impacts that score as well.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Cavanagh with APG.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for the call. Before going to the questions, I just wanted on your announcement
about moving to two calls per year, I would say that we very much appreciate your industry-leading outreach with
Fixed Income investors, particularly these quarterly updates and presentations. And I would encourage the
continuation or at least keeping up the overall high level of engagement because I think it pays benefits even with
current spread levels being so tight.
Going on to questions, perhaps we can dive into looking at the overall health of the consumer, particularly in the
credit card portfolio. Could you give us your expectations for net charge-offs on both the retail and branded card
portfolios for 2021 and 2022? And then could you dovetail that into what are you seeing as far as differentiation
across the FICO bands in these portfolios? I'm really trying to get at, is there a differentiation between higher
scores and lower scores? And given the expected runoff of a lot of the COVID relief efforts and the pending
eventual having to pay rent again for some people and then having to pay student loans again, is there kind of a
risk for a cliff effect there and impact on net charge-offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Scott. Why don't I take that? First of all, I would say that we very much value the engagement with you
all as investors as well, and so we look forward to continuing that.
Secondly, with regard to the consumer, it's interesting. The consumer again has proven to be incredibly resilient
through this, and obviously the stimulus that's been provided has been helping to bridge consumers in a
substantive way. When we look at the performance that we've seen through the fourth quarter, we continue to see
payment rates run at a very good level. We saw a pickup in purchase sale activity, or certainly not down nearly as
much as it was earlier in the year. And that's really across both portfolios, both the branded cards as well as the
retail services portfolio, so not a lot of distinction between the two in terms of that positive activity.
As you would have seen in some of the cost of credit information, we've also seen delinquencies remain quite low
in the portfolio. And it's really the signs that we're seeing there of consumers' continued ability to pay and lower
delinquencies that lead us to believe that we're more likely to see losses peak no longer in 2021, but more likely in
2022, just speaking more broadly around the portfolio. That's going to vary depending on region. But for the US
portfolio, that's been pushed out more likely to 2022.
Now, the reality is that there is continued talk of an additional stimulus. And to the extent that additional stimulus
are put out there, that is likely to have a continued impact. The good news with the additional stimulus, assuming
similar behavior, is that payments continue. The downside to that is that puts pressure on loan volume. And so
net-net, we think losses more likely in 2022 at this point. Additional stimulus could impact that. And in fact,
additional stimulus could end up not only delaying peak losses, but also deflating peak losses. And so we kind of
have to see how some of that plays out, but thus far we feel very good about what we're seeing and in fact
continue to look at these behaviors for signs for when we should enter or reenter the markets, so to speak, with
marketing and programs that lead towards acquisition...

Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
That's very helpful. On the funding side, could you give us some guidance on what your expectations for potential
additional green or social bond issuance, and then where you stand on the investments for the recent Affordable
Housing bond issuance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So, Scott, it's Mike. I think on that, we were very happy with the two green bond issuance that we've done,
again, starting in 2019 and then following up with the dollar-based green bond in 2020. Of course, we wanted to
expand beyond that, and so we introduced the Affordable Housing bond last year. And so we do very much want
to remain active in this space of ESG, and so we'll look at other structures. We'll look at the potential to come
back and tie the green bonds or for another social as well. So this is very much something that will be a focus of
ours.
Of course, when we look at this issuance, we look at this issuance in the context of the broader needs. Obviously,
we're going to be taking legal entities into account, tenor into account, investor demand, but it is something that
we want to continue to stay active in. And so with the housing bond, of course the proceeds for the transaction
finances construction, rehabilitation, or preservation of quality affordable housing for low and moderate income
populations in the US. So that's where the proceeds are used. And of course, as I mentioned, we want to remain
active in the space of issuance.

Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi, Gary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary David Kessler Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I just wanted to touch on the press again. So you guys have – not LIBOR, I think we all bought ourselves a little
bit of time there, but more on some of the decision-making. And it was helpful to get the conversation on the SLR,
thinking about the 2020 December CCAR and the redeem-without-replace option. And it looks like with what you
did issuance-wise in December and what you're calling out, it looks like maybe you'll go a little bit below 1.5%.
And sort of what's the target there in light of the CET1 cushion as well as other constraints?
And when you think about the refinancing decision, when you look at the two callable pieces of paper that you
have left on the institutional side, those are both – economically could be refinanced. And so should we be
thinking about, purely about the reset? And when you think about replacing, potentially re-fi and different
structures, do you think more, when you think about say a non-call 5-year versus a non-call 10-year, do you care
more about coupon optionality, the back end? How should we be thinking about these things?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, thanks for the question. In the past, we've talked about a target of roughly 150 basis points. And so where
we end the quarter, we're probably more like 160 basis points. So that range, that target of 150 basis points is still
something that we do think about. And as you point out, obviously we issued late last year, and use that as an
opportunity to call structures. That was an economic decision. And as we look at our structures, as we've talked
about in the past, as they become callable, we'll continue to first look at the need for maintaining that capital
outstanding. And if so, we'll look at the economics associated with leaving that structure outstanding versus
calling it and replacing it with a new structure.
In terms of the structure itself, as you said, the tenor of that call or even the back end setting that we embed, it's
really going to be a function of where that investor demand is. So we want to keep a good dialogue and
understand where there may be preferences. Of course, you've seen so far in the past as part of that transition
away from LIBOR, but more recently CMT, and again that's a function of where perhaps some of the preferences
are, obviously with rates very low and some steepness in that yield curve that that five-year CMT seemed to make
sense.
So you're likely to see us continue with that same practice of that targeted range of 150 basis points, the
evaluation of the economics as well as other factors. And then in terms of structure, we're going to continue to
maintain that good dialogue with the investors on what may be preferable.

Hey. Good morning, guys.

Hi, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
So it was positive development in New York about moving forward with a LIBOR solution via the legislative route.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about specifically in New York, if that becomes law, fixing that kind of
fallback language, where specifically that helps? And then maybe what other parts of your capital structure might
need, something in Delaware, something similar in Delaware, like I think some of the preferreds are covered by
Delaware law?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, Brian. It's Mike. In terms of that legislation, I think I've said this in the past. The LIBOR transition, it's
certainly a complex transition, and the recognition of coming up with some legislative solutions we think is a very
positive development. And you talked about New York, and the press would be more applicable to Delaware. But
I would say just getting started on a framework for legislation in terms of how that would apply, what is the scope
of it I think is a positive development. Certainly could you see states following once there is a precedent and a
framework?
The other thing I would point out too, is there more – is there a development in the federal space as well around
legislation? So I think this is the types of developments that are encouraging, and New York on its own may not
solve some of the things that we're focused on, on its own. We still think it's a positive development as well as that
potential for legislation, the federal legislation as well.

Sure. Brian, you came across a little bit muffled but I think you were asking about the timing in terms of the
strategy for me and Jane. Is that right? Did I get that right?

So look, you obviously heard Jane on the earnings call. She takes the seat end of February, first of March, and so
certainly want to give her time to get squarely in the CEO seat. And as she mentioned, we're spending time now
and we'll spend some period of time thereafter to really try and do a thorough kind of review.
What I would say, though, is that in some ways you can look at some of the announcements that we put out
already and see that we're not waiting for when things make sense. So we recently announced the creation of a
new Wealth Management unit, which really brings together our Private Bank and our Consumer Wealth
organization, which includes the International Personal Bank and the Citi Personal Wealth Management business.
It brings all of that together and really moves to create a single integrated platform to serve our clients, clients
everywhere from the affluent level straight up to the ultra-high net worth client.
And I simply highlight that to say that while we're working on taking a look at the strategy, as Jane suggested,
we're not waiting where things make sense to kind of get off the ground. And so stay tuned. We'll continue to work
through it and it's obviously an imperative for the entire leadership team, with Jane driving it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence
Hey, Mark, Mike, and Tom. I appreciate the call. It's always very helpful. So compared to peers, your 11.5% CET1
target seems very conservative. It's 150 basis points above your 10% requirement, and that compares with peers
that are maybe looking at a 50 to 100 basis point excess target. So you've done well on the past few stress tests.
You talked about this reevaluation process. I think simplification was a word I heard. So is there a chance to
evaluate the CET1 target as well going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So what I'd say is look, we're still – as you know, Arnold, we're still kind of managing through a crisis with some
uncertainty that's still out there. And so as I sit here today, I continue to feel good about the 11.5%. When we
established that, as you know, we were looking and still had uncertainty around things like the stress capital buffer
and how that would play out. We've now seen that both at the 2.5% from the initial submission and an increase of
about 10 basis points in the most recent, although that stopped being applied.
There's still movement obviously with the G-SIB score that I referenced earlier, which is at 3% for us now, but with
the increase in deposits, we're currently running a bit higher than that. And so I feel good about the 11.5%, and
we'll continue to look at that as things continue to normalize. But at this stage, that's where we are.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
Now, I would remind you or continue to point out that we ended the fourth quarter at 11.8%, which obviously is
above that target that we have. And I think we've had a pretty good run rate leading into this crisis of being
thoughtful about returning capital at a reasonable pace. And we'll continue to do that, particularly given that the
Fed has reinstated the ability to do that in Q1 here. And so we're looking forward to that.

Great, thanks for that. And then shifting to deposits, the classic teachings I guess are that deposits are good. But
in this low rate world where there is lots of liquidity and low loan demand, have deposits become a burden in a
sense? Or is there something – is it just the stage of the cycle where demand is low for loans that you want to
take on an extra I guess relationship? So are deposits a burden right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I can start and then, Mike, you may want to chime in. What I'd say is we obviously talk to some of the
deposit momentum or growth that we've seen across the franchise. And I think there are probably a couple of
lenses through which one can look at that. One is, it obviously is a lower cost of funding than some of the other
alternatives that one would have. Two is, I think if you look at the nature of the growth that we've had, take for
example the US consumer, it really leverages or demonstrates the payoff, if you will, from the investments we've
been making in our digital capability and helps to expand our customer footprint beyond just where we have
branches, and so that's good. And, as you know, we look to use that to expand our wallet share with those
customers.
And the third thing I'd point to is even as we look on the institutional side, where we've had good deposit growth
with our TTS clients, it really is and does create a foray to expand the nature of those relationships as well as
they've opened new digital accounts with us and expanded the dialogue to include conversation around their
supply chain and things of that sort.
Now, the reality is also the other factor that comes into play here is what you suggested, which is that there is low
loan demand, and that is something that we continue to watch and monitor. And the deposits do put pressure on
the G-SIB score, and we just talked a little about the SLR as well. And so we'll have to continue to manage that
and monitor that. And, hopefully, we end up with relief as it relates to things like G-SIB. But we're approaching this
from a relationship point of view, and we think that's pretty important. Mike, I don't know if you want to add
anything to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A

No, nothing to add, Mark.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
A lot of questions asked and answered, so a couple of follow-ups. On Scott's question on consumers, given that
you're seeing in the US problem credits peaking in the first half of next year, will the allowance for loan loss
reserves there just remain static for the rest of the year, or could you see releasing some of those reserves as you
get a better handle on that? And maybe there are some CECL implications in there that you could talk about.
Second question I had was on slide 22, and it relates to your comments on rest of the world, Latin American 90
days past dues picking up to 2.5%. Is that what you're seeing and that's why you're saying that peak there will be
in the second half of this year? And then I had a question on the IB.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Why don't I start with your question with regard to consumer reserves and what could impact that going
forward? I guess there are a couple of things that factor into the reserving actions that we take. And so one would
certainly be changes in the portfolio, and that is to say recovery in spend, an increase in loan volumes, or even
customer behavior and mix. Those things will factor what happens with – factor into what happens with the
reserve levels.
The second is kind of the base scenario or even the two scenarios that we look at, so the base scenario, which
will reflect the shape and the pace of recovery. And to the extent that we continue to see improvements in that
base scenario, with the assumptions GDP, unemployment, et cetera, that will have an impact on our estimate for
the lifetime reserves, in this case associated with the Consumer portfolio.
The third would be how we look at the downside scenario. And obviously, to the extent that it's more severe or a
higher probability of a downside or a lower probability of a downside, that will factor into how we think about that
EUMA, that management adjustment that we've talked about before. And then losses obviously play in as well.
As we see those losses materialize, all things being equal, we'd be releasing reserves. So there are a number of
factors that will come into play as we see reserves move around in the coming quarters.
What I would say or the final point I'd make on this is that even as we sit here now relative to the assumptions we
had for many of those variables when we ended the year, many of them have moved in a positive direction, have
improved. And so not to repeat it all again, but that becomes a factor, that shape and pace of a recovery is
factored in there. And as I said on the earnings call, I do expect that we'll see improved profitability in 2021, and
we're more likely to see releases.
In terms of – and your second question was with regard to Latin America. And what I'd say here is – and I'm
looking at kind of the trend that we saw in both NCLs as well as delinquencies. And in the earnings deck, we
showed that delinquencies were coming down in the fourth quarter and that our – I'm sorry, that losses were
coming down in the fourth quarter, excuse me, and that delinquencies were picking up a bit. And what I'd highlight
there is the difference between customers that are on the relief program and coming off versus customers that
were never on that relief program. And so what we're seeing in the delinquencies that are on that chart reflects
the fact that customers coming off the relief program are starting to flow through those delinquency buckets. What
13

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
we're seeing in the lower net credit losses represents favorable performance from customers that were not on the
relief program.
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of that dynamic. But to answer your question more specifically, it is that
trend in delinquencies that give us a view that we are likely to see losses for Latin America, in this example, peak
in the first half of 2021.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Nikhil Khosla with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikhil Khosla Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning and thank you for hosting the call, two things, one a follow-up on Brian's question on the preferred
side. Given that there is a legislative solution out there and to your point if it extends to Delaware and there's a
federal angle to it, if that were to happen, would it preclude the exchange or consent path that you've been talking
about on previous calls? So if there is a legislative solution, would you not go down the exchange and consent
because you can essentially – you have a fallback language through a legislative growth path?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
We would have to see, of course, what that solution would entail. It's a good question because I think when you
think about the complexity of the transition, when you have things like preferreds, you would put that in the
category of some of these structures certainly that remain fixed or even ones that are a float that would essentially
convert to fixed. Those are the types of things that are complicated. And so I do think legislation is one of those
areas that could provide a solution, but I do think it's going to be a consideration for what's included in that
legislation. We've talked about an amendment. We've talked about an exchange. We will continue to evaluate the
various alternatives to make sure we're ready to deal with any of those options when the timing is right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikhil Khosla Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thank you for that, and a follow-up to the peak losses and to your guidance around peak losses in the US
now in the first half of next year. How should we think about delinquencies trending there? And when should
delinquencies, very similar to what we're seeing in Latin America now where people coming out of relief programs
are flowing into the higher delinquency buckets, when will that happen in the US given the TDR relief, I believe,
has been extended until the end of 2021? So just trying to kind of triangulate, are you using that TDR relief of
people coming off forbearance now flowing into delinquency buckets, or when should we see that happening in
the US?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So I guess I'd make a couple points. One, I'd like to correct. I think I may have said that peak losses in
Mexico would be in the second half. I meant that they would peak in the first half of 2021. So I just wanted to
correct myself on that.
In terms of kind of US peak losses, again, there are a number of factors that come into play there, including kind
of how the stimulus continues to evolve and how much more stimulus is introduced. And so while that is the
current timing and the view, that stimulus response as well as the behavior from consumers will be a major factor
as to what peak levels look like and the timing of them. So I mentioned earlier the idea of delaying or deflating.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
In terms of TDRs, which I think was the other part of your question, we really don't expect to see a material
impact. We had limited usage of this relief kind of outside of the programs. And to some extent, even within the
programs, the usage has been limited. So again, I would say that any relief really didn't have a significant impact
on many of the important factors and variables, and I don't think that that will have a material impact kind of
playing into losses in 2021.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mark Kehoe with MacKay Shields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Good morning, just two quick questions. It sounds like there are some New York tech [ph] exception (44:30) firms
looking toward their banks for more additional lending to avoid a kind of final round of equity financing before the
IPO or do a SPAC. Can you just talk about how you manage the credit risk of lending to those firms, particularly if
they need to be on the IPO docket? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I'm sorry, would you – I had a hard time hearing your question. Would you mind repeating it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Yes, sure, sorry. It sounds like some of the New York tech firms are looking towards their banks for additional
lending so as to avoid a final round of equity funding before IPO-ing or going to a SPAC structure. I'm just
wondering how you are managing the credit risk of potentially lending to those firms in a debt capacity but also
needs to be on the IPO mandate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, yes. So again, and I think you know this about our kind of risk framework and how we think about our credit
profile. We tend to focus predominantly on our large multinational clients that are predominantly investment-
grade, which stick to kind of sectors that – or clients that are strongest in their sectors and that we have
longstanding relationships with. That said, we have been very active from an investment banking point of view in
the SPAC space and certainly have seen that play out in our equity capital markets performance through the year.
As it relates to credit risk related to that, we obviously have a robust framework and infrastructure around that.
And we set credit limits across different risk parameters for clients, and this would not be any exception to that in
terms of not only monitoring the profile of those clients but making sure that we're operating inside of limits that
make sense for the type of exposure that we want to take on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Okay, thank you. And just my second question, it sounds like you're kind of waiting for a lot of external factors
around the G-SIB buffer and the SLR. But is there any further optimization, both on the asset and liability side of
your balance sheet, that you can do just given the elevated deposit trends that are likely to exist for the near
future?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 29-Jan-2021
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sorry, Mark. Are you asking what other things can we do on balance sheet sort of in the deployment of those
deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Yes, or even kind of around the asset side as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. As we look at the balance sheet and we think about that deposit growth, last year, obviously, you did see a
surge in that lending activity as there were client draws. But given the amount of liquidity in the system, we saw
those loans repaid as we were supporting clients who accessed the markets at that time.
When we think about this year, that liquidity in the system remains, so that's still very much dynamic. And when
you think about what we could do on balance sheet, maybe just starting on the liability side, that deposit growth
does give us an opportunity to reduce some of the wholesale funding that we would have had, and what I mean
by that in particular, things like FHLB, so we can reduce that short term, long term. That makes room for us to
take in those deposits and support our clients. Of course, we'll always be looking at the callable structures as well
and whether we do need that liquidity or whether we should call it. So there's always going to be a set of liability
optimization that we'll be thinking about.
On the asset side, of course, I'll mention lending in a minute. But even in the investment portfolio, over the past
year. we grew that investment portfolio close to $80 billion. And the vast majority of that went into US Treasuries,
but we also invested in non-dollar sovereigns and agency MBS as well. So that will be something that we
continue to evaluate and deploy investments to.
Certainly, as we've seen some steepening of the yield curve and 10-year rates popping above 1%, that we are
looking at. And of course, if that yield curve continues to steepen, which we think it could, that will continue to
provide an opportunity there. And of course, we'll be evaluating how that lending activity evolves over the course
of the year, but that would be of course the more traditional deployment of those deposits. But the combination of
looking at managing the liability side as well as deployment into securities, those are all things that we will be
looking at to optimize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think that's right, Mike. We're going to actively manage all of this. We can't forget that the increased liquidity that
we've seen on the heels of some of the Fed monetary actions are a byproduct of this COVID-19 pandemic crisis
that we're managing through and that we're not entirely through yet. And so we're going to continue to look at the
balance sheet, both liabilities as well as assets, and try to manage that actively with client focus in mind and
certainly keeping in mind the capital implications. But what we really need to do is ensure that we get through all
of this and get back to some level of normalcy as it relates to all of these things.

Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Thanks, guys. As the loss curve keeps getting pushed out [ph] and cards to 2022 (50:36) and spend is
recovering, how are you thinking about the Card portfolio? Are you increasing marketing spend maybe to get
transactors, or are you changing any credit adjustments, or are you just trying to stay cautious?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, it's the right question. And when I think back to the last crisis, we learned that that timing is critically
important, the timing for which you put mitigating risk management in place as well as the timing for which you
decide to reenter the market.
We've taken several actions while continuing to serve clients, including pausing certain marketing programs and
balance consolidation offers, pausing proactive credit limit increases and reducing the size of introductory lines.
We've tightened the parameters around some of the digital lending activity that we've done. We've tightened
parameters around some of our customers. And so we've done a whole host of things in order to ensure that
we've been managing the risk through this environment.
Those actions obviously have an impact on interest-bearing balance growth and, therefore, on revenues. So it's
going to be important for us to reenter the market with client offers, given – or when the environment kind of
supports that. And to that end, we have been testing target market reentry. That's included sequential increases in
advertising quarter-over-quarter and marketing spend in the fourth quarter. In Asia, in markets where the
pandemic is more controlled, we've initiated kind of the unwind of some of our credit tightening action, and we're
looking to ensure that we can take advantage of the turn in customer interest when that starts to play out. In the
US and Mexico, expansion, frankly, has been a little bit more limited to-date. And over time, we will again look for
the right timing to leg in more meaningfully.

Kevin James Maloney Q

Great answer, thank you. Lastly, a number of FinTechs and non-bank financials have entered the consumer
lending space, including I guess buy-now/pay-later guys. Is that a competitive threat to the card market, or is it too
small to even think about?

Mark A. L. Mason A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Sure. A number of non-bank and FinTech financials entered the consumer lending space, including buy-now/pay-
later concepts. Is that a threat to the card market, or is it just too small think about at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, we don't take any of kind of the new FinTech strategies for granted. But what I would say is that those are
small efforts. We do have I think a meaningful scale in our Cards business, and we've got I think a very good risk
17

framework for how we assess new and existing customers and manage our exposure in a fashion that allows for
us to get returns that make good sense.
And so on top of that, our strategy involves how we expand the offering that we have with these clients and how
we serve them with enhanced digital capabilities. And I think the combination of continuing to evolve our
solutions, new channels for accessing clients like our Google relationship, as well as enhanced servicing play to
ensure that we kind of continue to capture growth when the market kind of stabilizes. And we'll watch many of
those other players entering the market, but in the meantime we're staying engaged with our customer base here.

Ryan Butkus Q
Analyst, Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks for hosting the call again. Just a follow-on from Mark's earlier question on slide 11 as it relates to the
high-quality liquid assets, so year over year this is up 24%. Available cash is at 56% versus 37% a year ago. And
you have things like Level 2 assets at 7% versus 14% a year ago now. So I was wondering maybe if you could
talk a little bit more about the pace and the categories that you could potentially consider redeploying some of the
available cash. Obviously, there's an element of conservatism here just given the background that you're
operating in, but I think it's just an interesting market dynamic to consider.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
It's Mike. I do think you raise a good point. So we do have ample space in that Level 2. As I talked about over the
past year, we really did deploy to I would say the vast majority of that portfolio that we hold, which is going to be
highly liquid product. Over time, we do typically look at spread products as well. We have deployed the spread
products in the past. Given the amount of surplus liquidity in the system today, spreads have come in. So we do
want to look at all the asset classes and evaluate the opportunity. But we are – if we're going to deploy to less
liquid, we are going to look at the returns on capital as well, so we want to be focused on the economics too.
So I didn't mean to rule out that we would look at those categories, but again, it's a portfolio that we're going to
maintain good liquidity in, and so the vast majority would continue to be into those more liquid products such as
Treasuries, agency mortgages. But at the right time, we will look to continue to expand spread products as those
opportunities arise.
