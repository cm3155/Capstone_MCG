Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the fourth quarter and full year
results for Cullen/Frost, and our CFO, Jerry Salinas will also provide additional comments, and then we're going
to open it up to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $101.7 million or $1.60 per share, compared with earnings of $117.2
million and $1.82 a share reported in the same quarter a year ago. For the full year, Cullen/Frost earned $435.5
million or $6.84 a share compared with earnings of $446.9 million or $6.90 a share reported in 2018. The lower
interest rate environment impacted our results as you would expect. However, our team continues to execute our
strategy of pursuing consistent above-average organic growth across our enterprise, and we're investing for the
long term while maintaining our quality standards. Our return on average assets was 1.21% in the fourth quarter
compared to 1.48% in the fourth quarter of last year. Average deposits in the fourth quarter of $27.2 billion were
up 2.6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year while average loans were up 5.4%. Our provision for loan
losses was $8.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $8 million in the third quarter of this year and $3.8
million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $12.7 million compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter and $9.2
million in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter annualized net charge-offs were 34 basis points of average
loans. Non-performing assets were $109.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with $105 million in
the third quarter and $74.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Overall delinquencies for accruing loan at the end of the fourth quarter were $58.2 million and that was 39 basis
points of period end loans. And those numbers remained well within our standards, comparable to what we've
experienced in the past several years. And overall, our credit quality remains good.
Total problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, were $511 million at the end of the fourth
quarter compared to $487 million in the third quarter of this year and $477 million in the fourth quarter last year.
The increase in the fourth quarter related primarily to the energy portfolio. Energy-related problem loans were
$132.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $87.2 million for the third quarter and $115.4 million in
the fourth quarter of last year. The energy-related problem loan total is mostly attributable to three borrowers with
whom we've been working for several quarters.
Energy loans in general represented 11.2% of our portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter, up from the previous
quarter, but well below our peak of more than 16% in 2015. Our focus for commercial loans continues to be on
consistent and balanced growth, including both the core component, which we define as lending relationships
under $10 million in size, as well as larger relationships while maintaining our quality standards.
The balance between these relationships went from 52% larger and 48% core at the end of 2018 to 57% larger
and 43% core at the end of 2019. The movement towards larger loans in 2019 was mostly due to activity in the
fourth quarter where some quality new energy relationships were added after exiting a number of credits during
the year. New relationships increased 4% versus the fourth quarter of a year ago.

The dollar amount of new loan commitments booked during the fourth quarter was up sharply, increasing 75%
from a year ago and 44% from the prior quarter. Even excluding the strong energy growth we saw in the fourth
quarter, new loan commitments grew 42% versus a year ago and 20% from the prior quarter and represented
good increases in both C&I and CRE. That said, quality deals are hard to come by. In 2019, we booked just 3%
more loan commitments compared to 2018 despite looking at 16% more deals. In CRE, we saw our percentage of
deals lost structure increase from 63% in 2018 to 69% in 2019. Our weighted current active loan pipeline in the
fourth quarter was up by about 9% overall compared to the prior quarter and was driven by a 20% growth in C&I
opportunities.
Of the 10 new financial centers that we've opened so far in the Houston region, four were opened in the fourth
quarter. We expect to open one more Houston area financial center in the current quarter on our way to a total of
25 new financial centers and we've already hired more than 150 of the approximately 200 employees we expect
to staff this expansion. Those new financial center openings benefit both commercial and consumer banking.
Let's look at our consumer business. We added almost 13,000 net new customers, consumer customers, in 2019,
an increase of 48% from a year ago. That represented a 3.8% increase in the total number of consumer
customers, all of it representing organic growth. In the fourth quarter, 32% of our account openings came from our
online channel, which includes our Frost Bank mobile app. This channel continues to grow rapidly. In fact, online
account openings were 30% higher compared to the fourth quarter 2018. The consumer loan portfolio averaged
$1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing by 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Frost Bankers have done a great job expanding our presence in growing markets. Our overall strategy of
sustainable organic growth is serving us well. The interest rate environment continues to present challenges to
our industry, but we remain focused on the fundamentals and growing our lines of business in line with our quality
standards. 2019 had its share of challenges, but also had its share of achievements. Besides adding the new
financial centers in Houston that I mentioned, we also expanded into a completely new market where we opened
our first financial center in Victoria, Texas and we completed our corporate headquarters move to the new Frost
Tower in Downtown San Antonio, in the culmination of a process that began six years ago.
Our commitment to customer service was confirmed when Frost received the highest ranking in customer
satisfaction in Texas and J.D. Powers' US Retail Banking Satisfaction Study for the 10th consecutive year and
received more Greenwich Excellence and Best Brand Awards for small business and middle market banking than
any bank in the nation for the third consecutive year. That's a tribute to the dedication of everyone at Frost who
works hard every day to take care of our customers and implement our strategies. And that dedication is what
sets Frost apart from other financial service companies.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.

Jerry Salinas
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I'll make a few comments about the Texas economy before providing some additional information
about our financial performance for the quarter, and I'll close with our guidance for full-year 2020. All of the Texas
macroeconomic numbers I'll mention here are sourced from the Dallas Office of the Federal Reserve. Texas job
growth was a very strong 4% in November and the Dallas Fed now estimates 1.9% Texas job growth for full-year
2019.

December statewide unemployment of 3.5% uptick slightly from the historically low 3.4% levels seen in each of
the six months through November. In terms of employment growth by industry, as of November, construction had
the strongest employment growth in Texas with 11.5% growth for the month and growth of 5% for the year-to-date
period through November. Financial activities was the industry with the second fastest job growth at 3.5% year-to-
date through November.
Energy was the only sector that showed meaningfully negative Texas job growth, down 2.7% year-to-date through
November. According to the Dallas Fed Surveys, activity in the Texas services sector accelerated again in the
fourth quarter and revenue growth in this sector has remained in positive territory every month since December of
2009.
Looking at individual markets, Houston economic growth remains above the historical average and the Dallas Fed
stated that as of November, data suggests continued moderate growth ahead. Job growth in the Houston region
accelerated to a 2.8% rate in the three months through November compared to a more modest 1.6% rate for the
full-year through November. Professional and business services, and education and health services led Houston
job growth over the three months through November, growing at 8.2% and 7.7% respectively over the same
period a year earlier.
Regarding the DFW Metroplex, the Dallas Business Cycle Index maintained by the Dallas Fed expanded at a 5%
annual rate in the fourth quarter compared to 4.8% in the third quarter, while the Fort Worth Business Cycle Index
expanded at a consistent 4.1% rate in the second half of the year. For the DFW Metroplex, November job growth
remained strong at a 4.8% annualized rate and area unemployment remained near multi-year lows at 3.2% in
Dallas and 3.3% in Fort Worth. The Austin economy has also remained healthy in November and the Dallas Fed's
Austin Business Cycle Index has now been in expansion territory for more than 10 years with index growth
remaining at or above the region's historical 6% average for the past nine years. In the three months ending in
November, Austin area job growth moderated to 2.4%. Austin's unemployment rate remained at 2.7% in
November for the fourth consecutive month.
The San Antonio region posted strong economic growth in November. The Dallas Fed's San Antonio Business
Cycle Index continuing to grow above its long term average. The San Antonio Business Cycle Index grew at a
5.5% rate in November and San Antonio job growth was 4.7% for the three months through November with area
unemployment remaining at 3.1%.
Permian Basin payrolls remained flat through November and the unemployment rate has ticked up in recent
months. While the rig count has generally declined in recent months, oil production has continued to increase.
Permian region job declines in the mining, manufacturing and government sectors were offset by job growth in the
leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, information and trade transportation and utilities
sectors for the year-to-date period through November resulting in overall flat performance for jobs in the region.
Despite the lack of job growth in the Permian region, November unemployment remained low at 2.4% for the
second consecutive month.
Our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was 3.62%, down 14 basis points from the 3.76%
reported last quarter. The decrease primarily resulted from lower yields on loans and balances at the Fed as well
as an increase in the proportion of balances at the Fed as a percentage of earning assets, partially offset by lower
funding costs. The taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was 4.88%, down 28 basis points from the
third order, impacted by the lower rate environment with September and October Fed rate cuts. The total
investment portfolio averaged $13.6 billion during the fourth quarter, up about $197 million from the third quarter

average of $13.4 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 3.37% in the fourth quarter,
down 6 basis points from the third quarter.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.4 billion during the fourth quarter, up about $193 million from the third
quarter. The municipal portfolio had a taxable equivalent yield for the fourth quarter of 4.8%, flat with the previous
quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, about two-thirds of the municipal portfolio was PSF-insured. During the
fourth quarter, approximately $1.4 billion of our Treasury securities that were yielding about 1.51% matured.
As insurance against the potential backdrop of flat to down rates for an extended period of time, we made the
decision to add duration to our investment portfolio. During the fourth quarter, we purchased about $1.5 billion in
securities to replace the treasuries that matured. During the quarter, we purchased $500 million in 30-year
treasuries yielding about 2.27%, approximately $700 million in agency mortgage backed securities yielding about
2.37% and about $300 million in municipal securities with a TE yields of 3.3%. As a result of the maturities and
purchases I just mentioned, the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 5.4 years
compared to 4.3 years last quarter.
Looking at our funding sources, the cost of total deposits for the fourth quarter was 29 basis points, down 10 basis
points from the third quarter. The combined cost of – the cost of combined Fed funds purchase and repurchase
agreement, which consist primarily of customer repos, decreased 32 basis points to 1.21% for the fourth quarter
from 1.53% in the previous quarter. Those balances averaged about $1.42 billion during the fourth quarter, up
about $126 million from the previous quarter.
Moving to non-interest expense, total non-interest expense for the quarter increased approximately $21.1 million
or 10.6% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the Houston expansion and the
operating costs associated with our headquarters moving downtown San Antonio, non-interest expense growth
would have been approximately 6.3%.
Regarding the outlook for the full-year of 2020, the estimates for full-year 2020 earnings – we currently believe
that those estimates for 2020 earnings, the FactSet mean of $6.13 is reasonable. So, again, regarding the
estimates for full-year 2020 earnings, we currently believe that the FactSet mean of $6.13 is reasonable. Our
assumptions do not include any rate cuts in 2020.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I was just wondering can you talk about what the loan outlook is for you guys for 2020. I think before you've
targeted high-single digits, and I'm just wondering what the outlook is going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it's fairly consistent with that. It may be – depend on your definition of high, but certainly over 5% is what
we'd shoot for. And I don't think it will be double digits. So that's as close I think I'll get to it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then one of your competitors the other day talked about this increased competition from the non-bank
players and it resulted in a very high level of paydowns and payoffs. I'm just wondering what you're seeing on a
competition level in your market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Competition continues to be tough and it's mainly around structure, but it's – I wouldn't relate it just to non-
bank competition. I think I've said before it's been big banks, small banks, it has been some non-bank competition
as well. And I think from the people I've talked to in the industry, that's sort of a national thing. People are
searching for yield. And it's mainly around guarantees and advance rates and those type of things. And as I said,
we lost more deals to structure on particularly real estate this year than last year. We're at 69% loss due to
structure versus 63% a year ago. So, it's some factor, it's not the only factor, the non-banks.

And then just one more housekeeping, Jerry. In other income, I know it can be volatile. But there was a big
increase relative to the past two quarters. I'm just wondering there was anything unusual this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think we had a stronger capital markets underwriting fees during the quarter. Those were up $1.6 million
compared to the fourth quarter last year. And we had about $1 million on an insurance claim that we got paid on. I
think those are the two things that stand out.

Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.

Good morning.

Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
My question is on credit. Can you just talk about the level of energy charge-offs you saw during the fourth quarter
and for the entire year in 2019? And what you think is likely over the next few quarters given problem loans have
gone up pretty significantly in that sector?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think just in general – we're coming to the end of this process of moving through [ph] this leg (00:21:20),
most – we've got two large energy credits and non-performers both around, say, $30 million – a little over $30
million. And they've been working those things, we've been working those things out for a while; in one case,
three years or so, and the other a long period of time.
I think we're getting close to the point where a final resolution for those is going to happen. I don't know when it
will be exactly, but I think it's sooner rather than later. It could be the first quarter, it could be after that. And so, my
gut tells me that there'll be some charge-offs related to those. A good amount of it reserved for already, but
maybe not all and probably not all of it given what's been happening with the discount rates in the energy space. It
has been pretty well-known by everybody over the last couple of quarters.

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
So, I think we'll see higher energy charge-offs, but it's really related to the culmination of these deals that have
been working for a long time as opposed to anything happening with the new credits because there has been
some weakness in the sector. Does it make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Let me just ask a follow-up. So, in terms of the new problem loans that came in during fourth quarter, what kind of
gives you confidence that that kind of credit migration trend is, I guess, inflecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, well, I mean the one that was rated a problem in the fourth quarter, I mean, we have talked about it last
quarter, it was one that was on watch before. And the reason we put it there is because their plan calls for selling
assets. And we know that it's a difficult environment, it's a difficult environment to do that. Now they've got
strategic properties and early results on what they saw initially was pretty good. But it's not a great environment to
be selling assets. And so, we'd just be seeing how that works over time. But we decided [indiscernible] (00:23:57)
problem. But again like I said, early results on that are pretty good right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jennifer, in the fourth quarter net charge-offs on energy were $2.9 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Fine. And for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
For the year, I'm seeing – it looks like a little north of $6 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And just one more question on non-interest expenses. Just wondering, Jerry, if you think you'll see a similar
level of expense growth this year given you're trying to complete the Houston expansion. I guess you got, what,
15 more offices.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. Well, we don't give specific line item guidance. But, Jennifer, what I would point you to is our fourth quarter
to fourth quarter as reported growth percentage and expenses. And to me that's really representative of our
expectations going into 2020. Obviously, we, as a group, are all focused on trying to manage expenses in this
environment of trying to grow the business and in trying to being faced with some technology debt, if you will. It's
9


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
really important for us to focus on expenses. But right now, I would take that fourth quarter to fourth quarter
growth as kind of in the ballpark of our current expectations.

Jennifer Demba Q

Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I'd like to start with the margins. And NIM was obviously down a lot given how much LIBOR and short-term rates
move down the quarter. How are you [ph] think about the forward (00:25:41) NIM from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
<JERRY>
As I'm looking out in that fourth quarter, I think we're at 3.62% in the fourth quarter. And the way I – we are not
projecting any rate cuts, like I said. So, to me kind of what I'm looking at is we'd be flattish to maybe up just
slightly but really flat is what I'm thinking for 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 percentage-wise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, that's helpful. And then – thank you. On the Houston branches, I know it's early but for the branches you
have opened, can you talk about the growth trends you're seeing so far? Is it roughly in line with expectations and
then costs for the branches, is it coming out where you thought it would be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think we're happy with what we've seen versus what we expected. The cost number I think is a little bit less than
we had thought it would be just because we had many of them that were pushed near the end of the year. So,
that was really just more of a timing thing. And we're seeing good growth in households, probably seeing a little bit
better growth in households than we expected. A little bit better loan growth than we expected, a little bit less
10


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
deposit levels than we had expected but I'm not really worried about that as we get these relationships and I think
we'll see that be in line with what we were expecting to see.
The main thing I'm focused on is what's happening with relationships and those were better than we anticipated.
So, I'm not discouraged at all. In fact, I'm encouraged by what we're doing and how our people are executing.
Another good thing about it is that we've hired some great people and we're getting people that are willing to buy
into our culture and seasoned bankers. I think the average relationships managers, if I recall, was around 20
years. So, these are real, real solid people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And as Phil mentioned, we had kind of disclosed the $0.19 and we did a negative impact on 2019. It was
just a little bit better than we expected. And as he mentioned, a lot of that was driven by the timing of the openings
and for 2020 we're projecting that expansion. It's going to be the worst in the second year obviously. And so,
we're expecting a hit of $0.35 related to the Houston expansion in 2020 with improvements after that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. And then finally for Phil, so we saw another MOE earlier this week. Is an MOE
something that you would consider and I know the culture is so strong at the company, it really differentiates you.
How do you think about an MOE for Cullen/Frost? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, of course, no CEO will talk about that kind of things, but I'll just tell you what I've said consistently and
I'll say it again. And that is that you know that a rollup is not something that we're interested in, that we're
executing an organic strategy and I think the risk and the payoff is lower on the organic strategy and the payoff is
better. We're investing with our income statement as opposed to investing with our balance sheet.
The best use of an acquisition for a company like ours is really one that's not a rollup but puts you in a position to
do an acquisition – puts you in a position to do organic growth from that point forward. And so, but as I said
before, those things don't happen very often. They come along infrequently. The last time we did that was when
[ph] we moved out (00:29:55) to the Midland and Odessa market with WNP about six years ago.
So, acquisitions are not on our radar screen. What's on our radar screen is how we're growing the company and
growing the relationships every day and that's the thing we're focused on.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, thanks, good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good morning.

Hey, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
The energy loan loss reserve last quarter was about $33.3 million. It was about 2.3%. Did that – I know you had
some problem energy loans [ph] floating in this quarter (00:30:52) but did that change much on a linked-quarter
basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, we moved it up. It's about $37.4 million. Percentage – yeah, so we were at $33.3 million, you're right and
we moved that up to about $37.4 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right, that's helpful. And then when you take a step back and look at Houston, it was a little under $0.19 dilutive
to last year, it's $0.35 dilutive to this year, 2020. When will that hit breakeven? And how many years until you will
recoup all those losses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, the breakeven as we said before on average for these locations has been about 27 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Think 27 months. So, anyone can do the math on that, lay that out, and sort of see when those tipping points
occur. I think one thing to keep in mind is, this really in 2020 should be the highest hit. So, to the extent that you're
seeing a lower burn rate, if you will, even for the branches that are still maturing, you can add some momentum
from where we've been, say, in 2020. So, I see the momentum in terms of its contribution towards earnings
increases should begin in 2021. That said, they all have to breakeven and get to the point where they grow
earnings. So that happens in 27 months on average. So, just look at when we're opening them, and you'll make
your assumption there and see when you think those turn around.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then lastly...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A

Yeah. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Lastly for me, you've hired – I think you said you've hired 150 employees out of the 200 that are planned. Out of
the 150 that you've hired, how many of those were commercial lenders roughly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
About – I would say 20 of them are so in round numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a couple follow-ups, one on Brady's question on kind of 2020 versus 2021. Do you expect to have all the
hiring done and, essentially, the compensation and some of the facilities expenses in the run rate actually in 2020
expense run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes. You're saying do we expect to have most of that in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Because our current plan is – and one may fall out into 2021, but our current plan is to have those all opened by
the end of this year. And as far as the bankers are concerned, we typically try to hire a lot of the staff there six
months before. And so, the locations, we're kind of moving along this year with the expectation. I think Phil
mentioned that we were projecting one this quarter. I think we're projecting five in the second quarter. So, yeah,
there'll be a – you won't be at 100% run rate, but you'll get the bulk of it in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay, okay, good. That helps. And then, Jerry, as long as you're there, last quarter, you talked about
extending duration a bit. You did so this quarter. Curious if there's more to come for you in that area and then
maybe talk about the impact and how you think about a little flatter curve that we're facing right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think there is. We're continuing to have conversations. I think the plan is to continue to add duration. I think I said
we bought $500 million in treasuries. We're thinking about, potentially, if the market makes sense for us, we'll do
another $500 million there. Our focus really for the year is probably less on municipal securities than it has been
historically. We bought, I think, I said $700 million in mortgage-backed during the quarter and that's probably kind
of where we're headed as far as percentage wise. We're probably moving more towards mortgage-backed right
now is the current plan.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And really, I think you talked about a flatter yield curve, really, what we did, this was really kind of a proactive
move, kind of an insurance. We're kind of looking at where our exposure is and our exposure was to flat rate. And
so, from our end, it made sense for us to extend duration through our investment portfolio. If we get the
opportunity on the loan portfolio side we may decide to do something there. But, right now, yeah, I think that that's
our plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Thank you for that. And then Phil, just the commercial pipeline you talked about, up 9% sequentially
with C&I as the driver.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

And then earlier, you were talking about larger versus smaller – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, you talked about larger versus smaller. I'm just – that pipeline increase, can you talk about? Would you
characterize that as deep and broad commercial strength or would you say it's energy-driven or help us
understand that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's – I think the increase in energy in the quarter was – as much as it was, was just an anomaly.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
I mean, we had some opportunity to put on some really great relationships and we've been moving out of
relationships, ones which we didn't think were right for us or deep enough for us throughout the year. And so, we
just had a number of those hit. I would expect that – I don't have the energy pipeline percentage of that 20%
growth at C&I in front of me. But I don't expect a change in our focus on core over time. And you'll have
dislocations like you saw in the fourth quarter in a particular segment. Sometimes it might be commercial real
estate, sometimes.
So, I don't expect it to be much different. And we were looking – again, we're not getting out of large deals we're
good at. We want to do them. This core thing is about balance in the portfolio. It's working on the core and on the
large deals. So, I expect this to continue to be in balance there. We're focused on it, I'll tell you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. The basic message is that it's broad, it's not just energy in terms of what you do in commercial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. we haven't changed our focus there. Absolutely.

Operator: Your next question comes from Rahul Patil with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Thanks. I just want to drill down on the expenses a little bit. I know you talked about fourth quarter reported
expense growth year-over-year that was around 10.5%. That is kind of a good run rate going into 2020. And so,
you're basically guiding to a 10% to 11% year-over-year growth in 2020 expenses. Last quarter you talked about
expenses on a reported basis will be north of 8% growth. So, what has changed? Why that incremental growth in
2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I said – somebody threw out the number 8% and I just said it's going to be north of that. So, we didn't really give
any specific guidance. What I'll say is really our outlook for expenses really hasn't changed significantly for 2020.
The Houston expansion of course has been part of it. You saw a big increase in our technology expenses
between the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
16


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
We had really been projecting that to happen earlier in 2019. Those projects actually didn't get closed out until the
fourth quarter and so they had a big impact on the fourth quarter. But no, I mean our outlook for expenses
between last quarter and this quarter as it relates to 2020 hasn't changed significantly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. That's fair. Then the other thing is that you talked about 2020 EPS. Your reason you're comfortable with the
consensus EPS of $6.13. Consensus right now is not modeling a 10%, 11% expense growth, right? Loan growth
in that 5% range, that is essentially where everybody is thinking about loan growth for you guys. NIM outlook
appears to be slightly better. Last time you said you've probably noticed a downward trajectory through 2020, now
you're saying flattish.
I'm just trying to get a sense for where exactly in the consensus number is $6.13 are you comfortable? What's
driving that comfort level right now given that expenses are probably edging high?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
To be quite honest with you, we don't spend our time analyzing where consensus is at. We look at the bottom line
number and that's the number that we're seeing in FactSet and based on that number we're comfortable with the
overall projection. To be honest with you, I've given you a little bit more color than we typically do trying to help
there, but we don't give specific line item guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And just one last question, how are you guys thinking about Day 2 provisioning under CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that at the end of the day, from a CECL standpoint we would expect that the future of provisions, they're
going to continue to be impacted by charge-offs, the mix of loan growth, of course, the forecasted economic
environment and other factors. And at this point, there's obviously a lot to be determined to what happens by the
time that first quarter provision is concerned but we're not too worried about it at this point. But a lot of it will be
dependent on what the environment looks like at that point.

Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC

Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to follow up on the consumer loan portfolio. I know it's a pretty
small part of the overall portfolio. But if we go back a few years ago, the consumer portfolio had some pretty
strong growth and it has since slowed down quite a bit. So, can you just talk more about that portfolio? What
17


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
drove the growth a few years ago? And what's driven the slowdown more recently? And we have seen some
higher charge offs in that book more recently, anything to note there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, the main component of the portfolio that is slowing – in fact has declined some year-over-year, has been in
the personal lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit. The losses that you're seeing there really related to some
loans to some individuals whose companies had some issues and we've tightened up in that area on PLCs and in
the underwriting there. So, you're seeing that drop. And so, we don't expect that to be a systemic or recurring
issue.
We've actually had really good growth as it relates to the consumer real estate part of that portfolio which includes
home equity loans, home improvement loans, et cetera, and that continues to grow and we were happy with that.
So, really what you're seeing is really an offset on one side of the portfolio, again in personal lines of credit
offsetting what is good growth in the consumer real estate which has extremely great credit metrics and great
performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's all from me. Thank you.

Operator: Next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. I just had two quick follow-ups. The first on the deposit side, why did you guys have such strong
growth in average deposits? Do you have any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, we really have had good growth in the second quarter – excuse me, the second part of the year. It's
something we've obviously been focused on. Let me go here and just pull it. I think that – hold on, let me see
specifically what categories are growing here. On a linked-quarter basis, some of it was driven by good increases
obviously in the C&I category. So, if you're looking at a linked-quarter basis, the fourth quarter for us is always
stronger. I think the fourth quarter this year was stronger than normal. Like I said, some of that started in the third
quarter. And so, it's been in the C&I, the commercial deposits.
I think some of it has to do with rates, some of it has to do with volatility. But I think that we continue to make the
calls that we need to make. We continue to see growth in new customers. We continue to be focused on the
things that we need to do to grow the business. We had, during the 2018, starting in 2018, as rates started to go
up over 150 basis points, we were starting to have challenges on the commercial DDA. We were seeing some of
those balances leave as I think the opportunity cost of keeping balances in DDA accounts got too expensive. And
18


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
I think we're starting to – we're proactively doing some things to get some of that back on the balance sheet. But
in addition to that, I think just the lower rate environment is probably helping us there. And like I said, we're
continuing to focus on building those new relationships.
We've had great – from the interest bearing side, we've had good growth in the jumbo deposits – or jumbo CDs.
We've got a pretty competitive rate there and those continue to go up. But I've really been impressed also with the
growth that we've seen and interest on checking really to be honest with you. So, really just we've had some good
augmentation from our existing customers but we've also had addition of new customers. So, knock on wood,
we're pretty excited about the growth that we've seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, some of your Texas peers have called out pressure on restaurant
finance loans – restaurant franchise loans. Do you guys have a material exposure to restaurants?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I don't think we do. I mean, it's not something that is a big component to us and that's not – I've not heard
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The restaurant business is always historically a riskier part. But, no, it's not really something [indiscernible]
(00:46:02).
