Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Thanks, Emlen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'm going
to provide remarks on our financial performance, strategic execution and merger integration before turning over to
Glenn to review our financials in more detail.
The third quarter results announced today reflect a strong progress we've made in creating a high-performing and
differentiated company through solid execution on [ph] integration (00:01:21) activities and a laser focus on
delivering for our clients. We are [ph] one unified (00:01:27) Webster, growing across a diverse set of business
lines, realizing revenue and cost synergies, supporting the communities in an expanded footprint, and delivering
financial results that meet or exceed the target metrics we set forth when we announced [ph] the MOE 18
(00:01:42) months ago. Our financial performance this quarter was stronger than [ph] last quarter (00:01:47). On
an adjusted basis, we generated diluted EPS of $1.46 versus $1.29 last quarter. Net income available to common
shareholders, $257 million versus $229 million last quarter and PPNR [indiscernible] (00:02:03) $316 million.
The [ph] potential (00:02:08) of the company we have created is evident in our results. On an adjusted basis, we
produced a return on assets in excess of 1.5% and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 21%. Our
efficiency ratio was 41% in the quarter, an over 400-basis-point improvement. These results exceed the full-year
2022 pro formas we provided when we first announced our merger in April 2021. We are surpassing loan growth
expectations without expanding our risk tolerances. We're [ph] proactively optimizing (00:02:42) the balance
sheet. We've continued to generate solid fee income. We've done an excellent job of maintaining client service
levels, adding and retaining clients and talent, while executing on the integration plan. Given the positioning of our
balance sheet, the NIM [ph] expanded 23 basis points to (00:03:00) 3.5%.
Loans grew meaningfully this quarter, driven [indiscernible] (00:03:06) asset classes and geographies. Several of
our major loan categories grew significantly, including C&I, CRE and residential mortgage. Deposits also grew
just under 2%. While executing [indiscernible] (00:03:23) cost synergies and approaching an efficiency ratio of
40%, we continue to make investments across the company. We have said from the outset that Webster post
MOE is a [indiscernible] (00:03:33). We have been adding to commercial verticals. [indiscernible] (00:03:37) we
had the opportunity to add middle market [indiscernible] (00:03:40) national ABL team.
We will continue to look for and make investments in colleagues and businesses that can grow our differentiated
commercial business lines and that will generate deposits, fees and loans, and we look to maximize economic
profit over time. We will also continue to [ph] invest (00:04:00) in technology that enhances colleague and client
experience. As we operate in an uncertain macro environment, we continue to execute on asset growth, while
staying disciplined and prudent in the risk selection, underwriting and portfolio management activities. Our credit
metrics remain remarkably strong with lower NPLs and NPAs, lower commercial classified loans, and lower
delinquencies, all compared to prior quarter on both a percentage of portfolio and absolute basis.
While you will see the net charge-offs were elevated from the prior quarter at a reported 25-basis-point
annualized, approximately $13 million of the net charge-offs resulted from proactive balance sheet management
and optimization through the sale of more than $500 million worth of loans that were either no longer strategic or
had suboptimal risk/return [ph] metrics (00:04:55). Absent those portfolio actions, the net charge-off rate would be
an annualized 13 basis points, more in line with Q2 and still below our five-year [indiscernible] (00:05:06)
annualized range of 16 basis points to 19 basis points.
A quick recap on integration. As I touched on a number of the items [ph] in the (00:05:15) integration slide
already, we continue to integrate sub-ledgers and systems [ph] underlying our (00:05:19) core infrastructures,
combined our commercial credit risk management system, and rolled out consolidated commercial pricing tools,
and we continued our corporate real estate consolidation, where we are now 50% complete. Major milestones we

anticipate in the fourth quarter include the consolidation of cloud data centers, the transition of our consumer
wealth and investment services operations to a third-party provider; and by year-end, all of our colleagues will
have completed cultural activation sessions, establishing a common foundation for our organization and aligning
colleagues on strategy [ph] expected (00:05:56) behaviors and, most importantly, the strong values that are at the
foundation of Webster Bank.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Glenn to review our financial performance for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will start with [indiscernible] (00:06:10) reconciliation of core
earnings on slide 4. We reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $230 million with EPS of $1.31.
On an adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $257 million and EPS of $1.46, each of
which exclude one-time after tax expenses of $27 million. Merger expenses were related to real estate
consolidation, [ph] severance and profession (00:06:37). The strategic initiative expense is primarily a contribution
to the Webster foundation.
Next, I'll review balance sheet trends before moving on to the income statement. On slide 5, at period-end, total
assets were $69.1 billion with total loans of $47.8 billion and total deposits of $54 billion. Loan growth was
predominantly driven by the commercial and residential portfolios. Deposits were up over $900 million on a
quarter-over-quarter basis with both public funds and HSA contributing. I will provide some additional color on the
breakout later in the presentation. Loan growth was also funded [ph] in part with cash flow (00:07:19) from the
securities portfolio and shorter duration FHLB advances.
Slide 6 highlights [ph] the diversity (00:07:27) of our loan growth by category, a great illustration of the breadth of
our promising [ph] business lines (00:07:33). In total, we grew loans $2.2 billion or 4.8% on a linked quarter basis.
Growth was [ph] evenly balanced (00:07:41) between categories with C&I, sponsor and commercial real estate,
all growing [ph] about $600 (00:07:47) million, and residential mortgage growing $400 million. Yield on the
portfolio increased 60 basis points. Excluding accretion, the yield increased 72 basis points, a reflection of [ph]
61% (00:08:09) of the portfolio being floating or periodic.
Switching to deposits on slide 7, total deposit balances increased by $932 million or 1.8%. Increases in public
funds and HSA drove the growth, with the former up over $800 million and HSA up $111 million. Corporate
deposits grew roughly $500 million as we utilized a greater number of [ph] suite (00:08:34) and other alternative
sources of funds. The total deposit costs increased 28 basis points from 9 basis points prior quarter. Our effective
data was 13% in the quarter and 11% since the closing of the merger. HSA cost of deposits were unchanged,
illustrating the value of the business in a rising rate environment. A final note on HSA. Excluding third-party
administrative accounts, deposits grew $700 million or 9.8% year-over-year. Additional detail on HSA Bank is on
slide 20 in the appendix.
Beginning on slide 8, I will review the details of our income statement. We provide our reported to adjusted
income statement by line item and compare our adjusted earnings for second quarter. Significant growth in net
interest income this quarter drove meaningful improvement in PPNR, net income and EPS. On an adjusted basis,
PPNR was up $56 million or 17.6%, net income was up $28 million or 12.4%, and EPS was up $0.17 or 13%. I
will cover the individual line items in more detail on subsequent slides. The net interest margin was 3.54%, up 26
basis points on a reported basis. And our efficiency ratio was 41%, down 408 basis points.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
On slide 9, net interest income grew $64.3 million relative to the prior quarter. Adjusting for accretion in both
periods, net interest income was up $76.8 million. This was an exceptionally strong result, driven by growth and
the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. Excluding accretion, the net interest margin increased 35 basis points
to 3.44%, and the earning asset yield was up 57 basis points in the quarter, also excluding accretion. In addition
to the trajectory of benchmark rates, the increase in loan yields accelerated, as the portion of our loan book that
reprices is no longer impacted by floors. As illustrated on the earlier slide, the cost of deposits increased 19 basis
points quarter-over-quarter. While we anticipate deposit pricing increases in the coming quarters, our NIM should
continue to grow given the attractive profile of our earning assets, which reprice and originate at higher absolute
rates.
On slide 10, we highlight our fee income for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, fees were down $7 million linked
quarter and $3 million year-over-year. The linked quarter decrease in fee income was driven primarily by lower
levels of customer interest rate hedging activity and other transactional loan fees in commercial banking. The
year-over-year decline was the result of lower direct investment and mortgage banking income.
Slide 11 summarizes non-interest expense. We reported adjusted expense of $293 million relative to prior quarter
of $292 million. We continue to make progress on cost efficiencies related to the merger; however, this quarter
included increased levels of performance-based compensation. The year-over-year decline of $2 million is the
combination of our cost save efforts to-date, offset by the increase in intangible amortization, the Bend acquisition
and performance-based compensation.
Slide 12 highlights our allowance for credit losses, which was up $3 million over prior quarter. After recording $28
million in net charge-offs, we recorded $31 million in provision expense, with loan growth representing $20 million
of the increase and macro factors adding $11 million.
On slide 13, we highlight our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, non-performing assets declined $38
million or 15% quarter-over-quarter. Likewise, commercial classified loans declined $98 million or 14%. Net
charge-offs in the upper right totaled [ph] $28 (00:12:26) million or 25 basis points of average loans on an
annualized basis. As John mentioned, $13 million of the charge-offs were related to portfolio optimization
activities. Without that, net charge-off rate would have been closer to 13 basis points. The allowance coverage
declined modestly from 1.25% to 1.2% at period-end. The allowance to non-performing loan ratio increased 2.7
times up from 2.3 times last quarter. Coverage as a percent of commercial classified loans increased to 95% from
81% last quarter.
Slide 14 highlights our strong capital levels. All capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory and internal
targets. Our common equity tier 1 ratio remains strong at 10.82% and is still above the medium-term operating
target of 10.5%. The tangible common equity ratio was 7.27%. The net of all capital effects this quarter resulted in
a slight decline in our tangible book value per share, which decreased to $27.69. This was primarily driven by
AOCI valuation, share repurchases, and partially offset by strong earnings.
I'll wrap up my comments with our outlook on slide 15. We have narrowed our view down to the remaining
quarter. We expect GAAP net interest income on a non-FTE basis of $570 million to $590 million, excluding
accretion, driven by our projection of a year-end Fed funds rate of 4.25%, as well as continued loan growth. This
excludes $15 million of scheduled purchase accounting accretion, the details of which can be found on slide 18 in
the appendix. For those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly $14 million to that
measurement. Relative to last quarter, our outlook implies full year net interest income, excluding accretion of $2
billion, an increase of roughly $100 million or 5% from the outlook we provided last quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
We expect loan growth for the quarter will be in the range of 2% to 3%. Given progress so far this year, that would
imply a growth of around 14% since merger close relative to our original target of 8% to 10%. Fee income should
be in the range of $105 million to $110 million, which incorporates the impact of lower fees on the outsourced
consumer investment business. Core expenses are expected to be in the range of $290 million to $295 million,
which includes increased performance-based compensation relative to our prior estimates. On capital, our overall
philosophy is unchanged. As we approach our medium-term operating target, organic growth opportunities will
likely [ph] occupy a (00:15:12) greater share of capital deployment, and we will remain disciplined in evaluating
opportunities to effectively deploy capital. And lastly, we are forecasting an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for closing remarks.

John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. We recognize we're operating at a time of uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical
landscape and that there are wider ranges of potential outcomes that could impact the operating environment. We
believe that our diversified and high-quality businesses and loan and securities portfolios, our healthy capital and
loan reserve positions, our credit and operating risk infrastructures, and the quality of our colleagues all have us
prepared to effectively navigate the macro environment ahead. As I mentioned above, we are being thoughtful in
our loan risk selection and emphasizing strong underwriting and portfolio management processes.
I want to wrap up by emphasizing the outstanding progress we've made year-to-date and the momentum we
expect to carry forward. Our commercial loans are on pace with 14% growth this year as we pursue growth in
businesses where we have a strategic advantage and the ability to be selective with respect to risk profile and
return metrics. Our deposit franchise positions us particularly well relative to peers where our total cost of deposits
increased just 19 basis points relative to a 57-basis-point increase in our earning asset yields, excluding the
impact of accretable yield. We remain confident in our ability to fund future loan growth, given our multiple deposit
channels and our liquidity profile. We expect we will continue to meaningfully benefit from interest rate increases
and we have levers to pull in terms of capital allocation, efficiencies and investment to maintain the current
momentum.
We'll be sending out a save the date, but we wanted to provide a heads-up that our intention is to hold an Investor
Day in New York City on March 2, where you'll have the opportunity to hear from our talented management team
on our company and the go-forward strategies and financial performance expectations for 2023 and beyond. And
finally, thank you to my colleagues for their continued diligence and hard work as they execute on our core
business initiatives, while addressing the added challenge of integrating the new Webster.
And I want to apologize. I understand we had some technical difficulties at the beginning of the call, and I thank
you for bearing with us.
Operator, Glenn and I will open it up to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris

Hey, Chris.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe, Glenn, the upgraded NII guide, the $100 million, I guess, very
good update. One of the trends we've seen this quarter is the narrative around peak NII. Wouldn't seem like that's
the case given this, but can you speak to growth from that fourth quarter level as you go into 2023? I'd be
interested in your thoughts there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Great. So, let me just start. I'll talk a little about NIM. So just for texture, I think our ex-accretion or exit NIM
in September was 3.55%. And then I would think, if you look at our Q4 range, I'd probably put that in the range
again, ex-accretion of 3.6%. So, we continue to see NIM expansion. As we look out into 2023, I think there's a
couple of factors. One is that our modeling, we're expecting peak Fed funds in the second quarter of around [ph]
$450 million (00:18:59), right. And so, given that dynamic and our beta, which we're forecasting, again, in like the
low-30s over the next four quarters, we continue to see NIM expansion. Now, we see NIM expansion going into
the first quarter, and then we see more modest NIM expansion in the back half of the year. So, I think we still feel
really positive about the prospects in 2023. The dynamic here is that, even though we have higher deposit pricing
which we are expecting, our asset book is repricing more significantly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great. Is the 30%, the low-30s, that's interest-bearing or is that total?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then, if I could, the actions you took in the quarter to clean up credit, could you just provide a little bit
more color on that? I think you said you – I think, there's a loan sale. Maybe, I guess what prompted this? Could
you consider more? And, I guess, how should we be thinking about the confidence in credit going into the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, happy to talk about it, and I think it's important to talk about it. I think it was less to clean up credit
and more literally to kind of optimize our balance sheet going forward. So, we've talked publicly in the beginning
that after diligence and closing the deal, we liked all the businesses, but that over the next four to six quarters
from close, as good stewards of capital, we would continue to look at all of our businesses to see whether they
remained strategic, whether the risk return dynamics were strong, whether or not there were any potential kind of
credit weaknesses as we looked out over paradigm shifts. And so, we took the opportunity. I mean, think about it,
we grew loans around 5%, including the disposition of over $500 million in assets. And with the tailwinds from our
asset sensitivity and the strong organic loan growth in key segments, we thought it was a great time to take those
actions.
And if you think about it, again, look at the total charges related to those actions over $500 million, the average
sale price was like $0.98 on the dollar. So this certainly weren't sale of distressed assets. And there were note
sales in there, there were portfolio sales, some to regulated banks. So this was not kind of a cleanup of credit
right in front of us. But obviously in a higher expectation of spread environment, there's an interest rate impact on
the discount on the prices, and there were some note sales of non-strategic office, for example, that we thought
now would be a good time to dispose of. So, we just thought it was a really smart move and, obviously, we think
it'll benefit us going forward as much from a return on equity perspective as from an [ph] avoid (00:22:09) credit
issue perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great color. I agree. Good move. Should we expect more into the end of the year, or is this kind of a...

John R. Ciulla A

I don't see anything right now. So, we don't have that in our guidance. I don't think it's going to be a reflection of
what we do every quarter going forward. We really like the businesses we're in. But obviously, as we said, we'll
continue to look at the dynamics of the combined portfolios. And so, if there are opportunities that make sense
from an economic perspective, or give us more flexibility going forward or protect us from potential paradigm
shifts in credit, we'll do it, but nothing that's in our sights.

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I know that we ended the quarter. I think we're – let's see, I have that here. So, I would put it in the range of
– yes, it might be – say in the range of 60 basis points to 65 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co
Okay. Great. And then, secondly, just to kind of follow up on one of the earlier questions about credit. I guess, I'm

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Mark, as you know, we think a lot about the provision line and we have a relatively conservative
bias, but that doesn't always factor in, particularly with CECL and the way it works now. So, I would say, at the
high level, and then Glenn certainly feel free to fill in, the dynamics this quarter were significant loan growth, right,

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
which requires a higher reserve. The Moody's scenario, which us and many of our peers use, was kind of worse,
right, which requires, in general, directionally more reserves. Then, you saw our credit stats, which as I said, I
used the word remarkably not to brag, just to be like surprising in this environment, right that our NPAs and our
classifieds were down materially. So that's kind of a good guy, if you will.
And then, I will tell you that, as I'm looking at the portfolio, one encouraging kind of data point for me is that, in
each of the last three consecutive quarters, the average weighted risk rating of our originations is actually better
than on a material basis than the actual weighted average risk rating of the existing commercial portfolio
translated into the fact that we are bringing on lower risk assets. Then we have each sequential quarter, which
ends up bringing down the overall weighted average risk rating, which again would be a good guy. So, you saw
those dynamics; bigger loan portfolio, more reserves; worse forward-looking economic scenario for Moody's,
more reserves; better asset quality metrics, lower reserves; and then higher quality originations, lower reserves,
and that's kind of where we end up. We feel really good. If you look at our peers, Mark, we're still top quartile, at
least in terms of our reserve coverage ratios, and I'm pretty pleased with where we are. We also have a lot of
capital. So, that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, Mark, is that John talked about the loan growth, $2.2 billion, $20 million
provision against that. And then if you look at the macro factors, and we have $11 million on the slide here, there's
really two things. One, if you just strip out the Moody's impact and the fact that they slashed GDP estimates, I
mean, that's probably $20 million, and sort of clawing that back is $9 million. So the net $11 million are those two
things. And that $9 million is really related to, as John highlighted, the improvement that we see in NPLs
[indiscernible] (00:26:23) classifieds, et cetera, and a weighted risk metric that's improving.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co
Great. And lastly, I wonder if you could give us sense for what your loan pipelines look like today, and maybe also
share with us what the commercial line utilization rates are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd say, we're still tracking [ph] all of the different lines (00:26:46). I would characterize the line utilization as
flat to slightly up, not materially across all of our commercial businesses, Mark, and I'm not sure what that
evidence is. I mean, I think still solid demand. But they're not – it's not expanding at a crazy margin, in ABL, for
example, which is usually a harbinger of faster working capital cycles, I would say, flat to marginally up. The
pipeline is relatively strong in certain sectors. I kind of feel like we'll see a flattening of loan growth over the next
couple of quarters in kind of core middle market areas. We have seen some slowdown in the trading of real estate
assets or in the sponsor book in terms of people selling companies and buying companies, so that has an impact.
But if I look just at my pipeline report which, obviously, I did last night, it's robust and it's similar, as you see,
slightly above third quarter going into fourth quarter where there's usually a heightened amount of activity.

Hey, Mark, before you go, let me just clarify something. I may have misunderstood the question. On our deposit
costs for the second quarter, I think we exited like a 41 basis points. But on the fourth quarter, we're expecting
that to be in the range of 55 basis points to 60 basis points, just for clarification.

How you guys are doing? Glenn, Just to clarify, I think you meant – you said third quarter, it exited the quarter, the
9/30 spot rate for deposit costs ended 55 basis points to 60 basis points, or you expect fourth quarter to end that
way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Well, I said the third quarter, right now, we're at 41 basis points. And as you go into the fourth quarter, with our
beta assumptions, we're probably in the range of 55 basis points to 60 basis points.

Casey Haire Q

Got you. Okay. Thanks for clarifying. All right. So, I was wondering about the funding strategy in the fourth quarter
underlying your NII guide here. So, in the third quarter, you guys kind of had a nice balance between a rebound in
the muni deposits, rundown on securities, and a little bit of borrowings. What is the outlook for the fourth quarter
and beyond here?

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So – great question. So, if you look at our loan guide, and you say, sort of take a right in the middle
between 2% and 3%, you'll probably be at $1.2 billion or something like that. So, let's just use that as a proxy. I
think that the thing that's really encouraging about the franchise is that – and we've pointed this out a few times is
that we have so many multiple levers of funding and liquidity sources that's really encouraging. So, as I look at
funding going into the fourth quarter and even beyond, some of the key drivers will be things like the continued
run-off of our securities portfolio as we invest that in loans. I think we have deposit growth in some of our
commercial segments, obviously, HSA, as we get toward the first part of next year. And then we have a digital
deposit gathering sources, whether it's Brio, whether it's Banking as a Service, things like that. And then lastly,
from a liquidity standpoint, we have plenty of sources of funds as far as funds that we can draw down on, but that
would be sort of the last thing we do. So, we continue to feel good about our funding ability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And the guide is predicated on another 100 bps of Fed hikes here. What kind of upside is there? I
mean, the forward curve is at [ph] $475 million (00:30:29) by year-end. What kind of upside would there be if it
plays out as the curve expects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, look, we're using our estimate right now of [ph] $450 million (00:30:41). Obviously, there's more
upside [indiscernible] (00:30:44). You could figure it out mathematically. But I don't – I guess, the thing I would
point out is the significance of our assets repricing and the slowness of betas coming around. So, I don't have
that. Where our model has, it's peaking at [ph] $450 million (00:31:03). If there's upside to that, that would be
additive generally.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And just last one on the credit front. So the $500 million disposition, was the sponsor and
specialty finance book touched? And just any color on the – if my math is right, there was about $60 million of
commercial losses outside of the disposition. Just any color on what was driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Nothing in sponsor and specialty was disposed of. And with respect to the core 13 basis points that I
reflected, driven by two commercial credits, Casey, one of which has been classified since pre-pandemic and
finally capitulated, neither of them were in the same geography, asset class, or kind of had anything that, I would
say, is systemic in there. I feel pretty good about 13 basis points of charge-offs at this point in the cycle. So
nothing to say, except two unique credits that ended up having loss given defaults at the end of the day,
unfortunately.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start on the deposit side. So, if we look at non-interest-bearing deposit balances, you actually had pretty
decent growth in the quarter, while banks everywhere are seeing outflows. How did you buck the trend in the
quarter, and do you now expect to see outflows of those moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steve, obviously, it's relatively good news, but we're also pretty realistic about it. There was some seasonal
inflows from government deposits, right. And so, our focus going forward is on making sure that as we kind of go
through the next few quarters that our focus is on continuing, where we're growing loans to grow full relationships,
to grow commercial deposits. Obviously, we're going to get the benefit of HSA as we get to year-end in first
quarter. So, I think we did it largely, because we've got really sticky deposits in our retail franchise. I think we've
got really good commercial solid deposits with our relationships. But I would have to say that a lot of the reason
we were able to claim a 2% deposit growth when there were outflows was a seasonal [ph] flow-in (00:33:36) from
government deposits.
So, as Glenn said, I think what's great right now about the way that our balance sheet is made up is we do benefit
from the asset sensitivity significantly. Obviously, we're taking prudent measures to make sure whenever the time
comes, when Fed funds rate comes down, we're protecting our cash flows. But it does give us some pricing
flexibility in key relationship areas on deposits. And obviously, we're focused now on continuing to generate core
deposits. But we've got HSA. We've got the direct bank in Brio, which is a higher cost deposit, but nonetheless, a
deposit that we found to be stickier than we originally thought it would be. And then we've got, obviously, all the
diversified business banking, commercial segments, small business and retail. So, it's going to be work and we're
continuing to focus on it, right, because if you're growing loans at the clip we are, we need to make sure that we're
continuing to generate good sticky deposits going forward. But we'll take the victory of growing deposits in the
quarter, but we also did benefit from government seasonality.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then finally, so regarding the acquisition of People's, this deal has attracted quite a
bit of attention in Connecticut, particularly around the system conversion that didn't seem to go as planned. How
much of an opportunity is that for you, right? You're the bank, I think of most that could benefit from what's going
on there. And have you seen any increase in client acquisition related to all the negative news on that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Steve, you can't ask that – you can't get me on that question. I have such respect for that bank. Look, we've
talked about this in the past that it's interesting, in a lot of our key businesses, we really don't overlap with
People's and we didn't overlap with People's and we don't overlap with the combined M&T-People's. There
obviously have been some disruptions. People's Bank clients are loyal because People's is a really good bank.
There are opportunities, obviously, with colleague disruption there as well, because that's not an MOE, it's an
acquisition. And so, there are opportunities from a personnel perspective and from a client perspective over time.
But as I said, it's a good bank, and I wouldn't want to comment on specific opportunities.

Matthew Breese Q

Hey, John, you alluded to this earlier, just talking about maybe a softening of loan growth next year, but I was
hoping you could better kind of frame that for us. I think, historically, you've always positioned the bank to be kind
of a high-single-digit grower. Obviously, [indiscernible] (00:37:11) last few quarters have been better than that.
15


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
How would you kind of frame for us what next year expectations are? And then secondarily, just a sense for
current rate on the pipeline? Yeah, I'll leave it there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question. And we're sort of not changing guidance. I think we're 8% to 10% year in and year
out. This year, I think we've been selective. We've got a couple of categories that have really driven growth, and I
think we're fortunate they tend to be categories with lower loss given default, which I'm happy about in this cycle.
As I mentioned earlier to one of the questions, our pipeline remains robust. I think we're going to have the ability
and the luxury, and I think many of our competitors will as well be a little bit more selective on rate and structure,
just given the fact that some of the non-bank lenders and their cost of funds and other dynamics are changing the
nature of the marketplace.
So, I still feel like when we made the announcement in April of 2021, one of the premises of the deal was that we,
on a combined basis, could grow our commercial loans 8% to 10% year in and year out. We're obviously
benefited by a bigger balance sheet and higher hold levels, which we've talked about. So, even if the loan market
and loan demand slows a little bit, some of the niches and verticals and relationships that we have continue to
enable us to grow loans. So, in our model, we're still looking at 8% to 10% loan growth next year, regardless of
kind of what the overall demand environment is, and I believe we can do it safely. We don't want Jason on the
call, obviously, because you never want your Chief Credit Risk Officer on the earnings call that generally portends
to bad things. But if he were here, I think we're able to kind of narrow our focus in resilient businesses, stay away
from things we think are more cyclical, and continue to grow loans safely at 8% to 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And the only thing I would add to it is, when you look at the quarter, I think our originations were probably about –
and this is the third quarter, at about [ph] $520,000 (00:39:22), 5.2%, right. And so, as we look out, it's probably
going to be closer to the range of like [ph] $550,000 to $600,000 (00:39:30) origination rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then could you just talk about digital deposits, the balances between BrioDirect and then
the Banking as a Service segment? And how much of your funding projections should we be thinking rely on
these buckets versus traditional [ph] street (00:39:53) retail and commercial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. Sure. And I think I've been pretty consistent in saying we've tried to lean in in those areas. Obviously,
Brio is up running and proven. And we're able to generate some deposits there. We did in the second quarter. We
did in the third quarter. Glenn can give you the number. As it relates to Banking as a Service, I don't know
whether this is a pivot in narrative. But in the second quarter, I talked about the fact that we have three or four
relationships that are live with a pipeline of about $500 million to $750 million of deposits, but that we really didn't
16


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
factor in significant profitability or contribution, nor did we factor in significant investment in the Banking as a
Service space.
I think the update there is, things are a little slower than we thought. Luis and I continue to kind of narrow our
focus in those areas, where we think we can drive core deposits and drive kind of liquidity. We're not factoring in
significant funding from the [ph] BAS (00:41:02) channel over the course of 2023. So, we're not relying on that in
our model. That would be upside gravy. With respect to Brio, we do expect to have that as part of our arsenal.
And maybe, Glenn, you can [indiscernible] (00:41:15).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. So, I think just to start, like digital direct is probably about $1.1 billion right now. [ph] And so – with the
biggest driver of that being (00:41:22) Brio. But as you know, Brio is like more of a higher beta type product, but it
is a lever that we have that we can get good funding. And as long as we're turning [ph] it into the loans in the
range of $550,000 to $600,000 (00:41:37), that's a pretty good funding source. So, I think Brio is one channel that
we have that we can pull the lever. We can adjust that pretty quickly. And then, as John mentioned, the Banking
as a Service and stuff like that. But more importantly, I think besides securities portfolio running off, we expect to
have deposit growth in commercial segments. HSA, as you know, will come in in the first quarter. That's the
enrollment period. So, we should see a pop on the HSA as well. So there's – again, I keep coming back to it,
because I think it's really unique for us is that we have so many multiple sources of funding that will continue to
distinguish us. And certainly, it's playing out in our financial forecast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then last one for me. Just going back to the loan sale, I think there's been some lingering
questions on whether or not there were areas of the Sterling portfolio that would eventually be exited or continue
to be part of the story. Did the loan sale have anything to do with kind of legacy Sterling ancillary segments? And
if so, what were those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'm not going to talk specifically. I think the overall theme is both banks had kind of suboptimal risk/return
businesses. And as we work through them, as a $70 billion bank now, we have the opportunity to decide whether
or not we can either accelerate and correct and improve businesses or decide to exit. So, I guess, I'm trying not to
be [ph] too mad (00:43:14), I think the answer is kind of, not specifically related to legacy Sterling, but related to
the entire organization, there are suboptimal portfolios that kind of we've looked at and moved through. We were
able to kind of act on everything we identified in the quarter as things where we didn't think we were going to be
able to get return for the appropriate risk.
Or as I said, on a couple of select note sales in key areas where there may be paradigm shifts like office, we were
able to kind of lighten our exposure. So, I'm going to leave it at that. And I don't think it's a worry. I mean, you
characterize it as kind of like a worry. But there are subscale and suboptimal businesses that we will, over time,
figure out whether or not we want to accelerate, or whether we want to exit and whether that exit is a loan sale or
just as a wind down of the business, that'll happen over time. But right now, we love the portfolio of assets. We
like the credit quality a lot in the entire bank when you bring all the portfolios together.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Maybe just starting on the bond book and using that as a source of funds, does that slow with the
expectation that loan growth slows? And does that pretty much end in the first quarter as the HSA seasonality
kicks in? I guess, what's a good kind of base we should be thinking about for the bond book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think you would continue to see – first of all, it has extended with the rise in rates. So, our cash flow has
come down a little bit. But still for the quarter, if you're using something in the range of like $250 million, I think
that's pretty good, right. So, that's how I would generally model it. But we continue to reinvest. What came off in
the third quarter is like $238 million that came off at 2.8%, 3%, right. So, if we can reinvest that in loans, you can
see the spread [indiscernible] (00:45:29) right. And so, we'll continue to do that as a source of funding for loans
going forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think we've talked about this, but I think if you look at the total book at $15 billion, we sort of think
of it as – part of it is that the deployment of the excess liquidity we had back a couple of quarters ago. And so,
that's done well for us from an earnings standpoint, but it's always been our attention to sort of move that into the
loan book and pick up 150 basis points, or now, 200 basis points in doing so. So, even with HSA coming in in the
first quarter, given our loan growth for the year, I think that'll still be a good source of funding for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe just bigger picture on the Sterling integration. I mean, the results post deal closing have
already been quite strong. Integration is still kind of slated for middle of next year. What changes once that
integration is complete? Is that just you'll be able to take out some more expenses, or do you expect to see some
operational gains kind of in how lending or deposit generation is being conducted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a really interesting question. I think it won't have a material impact on our ability to generate
revenue, right. One of the things we talked about with this transaction is the complementary nature. And again, I
always harp on this, and I'll take the opportunity to do it again is that, a lot of times when MOEs don't deliver either
in time or they don't deliver ever, it's not because of the cost saves. This wasn't a cost save deal. Only 10% of the
combined cost save. No banking center consolidation out of the gate, right. It was really about the fact that we
were able to put two banks together, where everyone could continue focusing on their customer, because there
was virtually no overlap from a retail business banking or commercial perspective. And I think that's proven out.
So, when we get the technology integration and conversion done next July, I don't think that signals our addition
to accelerate revenue, except, to your point, of having maybe a more resilient and scalable operational platform.
But for us, what it will do is, we will finally get to retire one of two core systems. We'll kind of finally get to retire
several commercial sub-ledgers and make us more efficient over time. So, we do feel like our operational
effectiveness will be better, our operational efficiency and our cost structure will certainly go down. And that's one
of the things we're excited about. You've seen, obviously, inflationary pressures on the industry throughout. We
still have another 12 months to 18 months of the ability to offset some of the pressures of inflationary expenses on
wages and other things by the fact that we still haven't consolidated three call centers, we still haven't fully gotten
19


Webster Financial Corp.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
to our conversion on our core systems. So, all of that should give us kind of more flexibility from an expense
perspective. I don't think it'll change the trajectory of revenue growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then, just last for me, more of a modeling question, the scheduled accretion guide of $14.6
million in 4Q 2022, do you have any visibility as to what accelerated accretion in the quarter could be, just kind of
looking at the delta between third quarter accretion and the fourth quarter guide? And I guess, for the third quarter
accretion, was any of that component driven by the $500 million of loan sales that kind of drive any of the
accelerated accretion component there?

No. I mean, this is generally – it's prepayments. I mean, accretion is down, obviously, quarter-over-quarter, but
there'll be volatility. Look, when we announced and put in the – you see the impact of purchase accounting back
on page 18 in the slide, that was just based on scheduling. And obviously, as customers prepay and stuff like that,
that'll accelerate, right. I think there's probably about 7 – maybe it's a smaller amount. It's probably $600,000 to
$700,000 due to the loan sale in that accretion, [ph] however (00:49:58) it's not meaningful.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Okay. But looking at the – I guess, it's hard to look at the pay-down schedule, but should we be assuming a
similar level kind of, of accelerated accretion in the fourth quarter or is that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Oh, we gave it to you. We laid it out for you there. It's like – on the loan side, it's [ph] $17 billion (00:50:13), right.
And that's our best estimate right now [indiscernible] (00:50:19). It could change based on prepayment activity
and stuff like that.

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q

AOCI, what was that intangible common equity this quarter on a dollar basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Without AOCI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
No, no. Just what was the AOCI drag in the intangible common equity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So the AOCI in the third quarter impact was – it's $688 million, right. That's after tax. So that's an increase of
about $242 million quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Perfect, perfect. Okay. Great. And then, John and Glenn, just going back to the $500 million sale, and I appreciate
you don't want to break out with legacy Webster versus legacy Sterling, how much of that was office? And then
kind of what were the other larger components in there? And then, just a refresh on office, right, we have – last
quarter, you gave us it was $2.2 billion, of which $520 million was in New York, or NYC, I guess, proper. Do you
have a refresh on what that is as of 3Q? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure, sure. I'm happy to do that. So the impact on our office exposure between the asset sales and other just
general amortization and payoffs is about $75 million. So, we're $75 million lighter on total office exposure than
21

what we had walked through, and I'll refresh those numbers for you in a second. And the rest of the stuff related
to kind of general C&I activity in terms of the $500 million, so general C&I businesses. I would say that to refresh
office, if you recall, there's not really a material change, except for the $75 million or so reduction. So, we talked
about $2.2 billion in total office exposure, about – a little over $500 million of which was kind of stabilized medical
office, which has a much better operating profile, and I think is not subject to paradigm shifts that would impact
traditional office. So, if you take that $1.7 billion remaining roughly, about half of it is Class A, the other half is
Class B/C, which is what we're focused on the most. So, again, take maybe 50/50 of the asset sales, you're down
to about $800 million in terms of B/C office exposure.
The total New York City office exposure in the five boroughs is around $400 million. That remains largely
unchanged and that's about split 50/50, A, and then B and C. We haven't seen really a change in the underlying
risk ratings or classified contents there, although we're not taking our focus off of it. And obviously, evidenced by
the fact that some of our discrete note sales were in that category, Laurie. But also, again, reminding you that we
sold all of those loans at a combined rate of $0.98 on the dollar. We weren't selling loans with identified loss
content. We're just making decisions to kind of eliminate non-strategic assets that, over time, could have lower
value.

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Got it. Okay. And just so that I'm clear, I had in my notes last quarter, $520 million was New York City, that's now
down to $400 million?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Let me check. Maybe it's 4 – oh, I think medical is also in that, Laurie, so non-medical office in New York around
$400 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
