Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Phil.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B., and good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the fourth quarter results
for Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will provide additional comments before we open it
up for your questions.
Well, in the fourth quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $189.5 million or $2.91 a share, compared with earnings of $99.4
million or a $1.54 a share reported in the same quarter of last year. That represented an increase of 90%. You
don't get to say that very often.
Our return on average assets and average common equity in the fourth quarter were 1.44% and 27.16%
respectively. That compares with 0.81% and 9.26% for the same period last year. These are very strong results.
And along with our strategy of sustainable organic growth, they position us well heading into 2023.
Now, taking a closer look at the quarter, loan growth was solid and above our long-term expectation of high single
digits annual growth. Average loans excluding PPP in the fourth quarter were just over $17 billion compared with
average loans of $15.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.6%. For the full year 2022 average
total loans, excluding PPP, were up 11.3%.
Our growth in loan balances for the fourth quarter versus the third quarter represented approximately two-thirds of
C&I growth and one-third consumer. CRE balances were basically flat. We booked $2.2 billion in new commercial
commitments in the fourth quarter, and this is up by a non-annualized 9% from the third quarter and demonstrated
our staff success from our calling and prospecting efforts earlier in the year. That said, I believe it's clear that the
Fed's program of interest rate increases is having an impact on economic activity, especially in the commercial
real estate sector as more borrowers evaluate the impact of the current environment on their projects.
For example, I think it's interesting to look at our weighted 90-day pipeline at year-end. It's down 14% from the
previous quarter. However, the prospect component of that pipeline is up 19%, while the customer segment of
that pipeline is down 32%. So as we continue to see potential deals come in from prospects as our strong
available liquidity and our consistent underwriting shine through, our current customer base reflects the overall
softening of the commercial real estate market.
Average deposits in the fourth quarter were $44.8 billion, an increase of more than 9% compared with the $41
billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full-year 2022, average total deposits were $44.6 billion, up
15.9% over 2021. And Jerry will talk more about recent deposit trends in his comments.
We continue to see great growth in our consumer banking business. Average consumer loans were $2.3 billion in
the fourth quarter, up by 22.6% over the fourth quarter last year. This is primarily from our consumer real estate
products of HELOC, home equity and home improvement. The outlook for these loans continues to be good and
credit strong. In fact, the consumer loan growth in 2022 was 283% of our previous best year.
The sharp increase in mortgage rates created the perfect environment for our secured consumer real estate
loans, such as home improvement, home equity and HELOC. Credit quality is outstanding in this portfolio and our
average credit score is 754.

I'm also pleased that we recently began funding loans in our mortgage program. Our team has created a new
mortgage loan process from the ground up to originate and service mortgage loans in keeping with the Frost
philosophy, and we've created a great digital and mobile experience around it. Once we complete this pilot
program, we'll roll out mortgage lending to customers on a more limited basis, with the goal of opening it up to
everyone later this year.
Growth in new households continues. For the year, we added almost 26,000 new households, about 6.6% higher
than the number of customers we had at the end of last year. While we believe this represents best-in-class
organic growth, it was down slightly from last year's all-time high of almost 27,000 customers and that's related to
the lower net number of branches that we opened in 2021. Given the increase in opening since then, we expect to
achieve all-time-high number of new customers in 2023. In addition, our Frost Wealth Advisors has seen a record
amount of new business.
Regarding our branch expansion efforts, the original 25 Houston expansion branches have surpassed $1 billion of
deposits, and they continue to exceed pro formas. Loans totals $727 million at year-end. Including the additional
branches we've opened in what we call Houston Expansion 2.0, at year-end, we stood at 114% of our household
goal, 170% of our loan goal, and 104% of our deposit goals. And we'll continue to add new locations and strong
areas around the region.
In Dallas, we are very encouraged by the early results of the new sites, which are doing even better than what
Houston had achieved in the same timeframe, 229% of the new household goal, 275% of loan goal, and 372% of
our deposit goal. We added new financial centers at a rapid pace in the fourth quarter and soon we'll be up to 13
locations under the program.
Overall, credit quality remains good. Problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, totaled $322
million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with $387 million at the end of the previous quarter and $691
million a year ago. We reported a $3 million credit loss expense in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs for the
fourth quarter were $3.8 million compared with $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Annualized net charge-
offs for the fourth quarter were 9 basis points of period-end loans. Nonaccrual loans were $37.8 million at the end
of the fourth quarter, an increase from the $29.9 million at the end of the third, which was the result of two small
credits.
With regard to the current economic environment, there are potential risk on the horizon that could result from
higher interest rates, continuing high inflation and pockets of supply chain disruption.
Overall, investor commercial real estate loan metrics remain stable and indicative of above-average project
operating performance across all portfolio asset types. While acceptable debt service coverage ratios are still
reported for office, multifamily, office warehouse and retail asset types, a year-over-year decline is observed at
fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates, higher operating expenses for multifamily,
and the inclusion of now completed construction projects that remain in lease-up.
Regarding specifically the office portfolio, our optimism around this asset class stems from, one, the character
and experience of the sponsors; two, the predominantly Class A nature of most portfolio office projects; three,
tenant quality and lease duration; and four, strong existing office portfolio metrics, including low loan-to-value at
an average number of 56% and weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.59 times for the current
stabilized office assets.

Office buildings outstanding at year-end were $1.8 billion, and of this amount, half was owner-occupied and half
represented investor projects. Our energy loan portfolio of concentrations remains in the single digits at 5.4% of
loans excluding PPP at the end of the fourth quarter. Our energy borrowers as a whole have advanced rates and
leverage ratios that are the lowest we've experienced in many years as borrowers have continued a program of
deleveraging and returning more to shareholders. The current oil and gas price environment continues to be
favorable for them. And our borrowers generally have a bullish outlook for prices for the near and intermediate
term.
Frost will continue to offer energy lending with prudent structures, including appropriate advance rates and
hedging structures to minimize risk. We've done a great job with closing out the PPP forgiveness process. So I
want to say I remain proud of our team that worked so hard and the relationships that we've built and
strengthened with customers when they needed the help most. We say this often that we've got a lot going on for
us. We're expanding into new areas with beautiful new financial centers. We're enhancing our consumer offerings
with all new mortgage loans. We're strengthening our communities and growing our brand awareness with
exciting new sponsorship opportunities that will pay dividends for many years. And best of all, we are continuing
with our strategy of sustainable organic growth. It's kept our company strong and positioned us well for whatever
the future holds.
Day in and day out, our employees do all this while adhering to our core values of integrity, caring, and
excellence, and by providing industry-leading customer service. At Frost, we truly work hard to be a force for good
in people's everyday lives.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter
was 3.31%, up 30 basis points from the 3.01% reported last quarter. Higher yields on both balances held at the
Fed and loans had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage. The increase was also
positively impacted to a much lesser extent by a higher yield on investment securities and by higher volumes of
both investment securities and loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher cost on deposit and
both higher volumes and cost of repurchase agreements.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $20.1 billion during the fourth quarter,
up $727 million from the third quarter average as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the
quarter. We made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately $1.2 billion, which included $735
million in agency MBS securities with a yield of 5.43% and $470 million in municipal securities, with a taxable
equivalent yield of about 5.38%. For 2023, our current expectation is that we would invest an additional $4 billion
of our excess liquidity into investment purchases during the year, or about $2.2 billion net of projected inflows
during the year.
The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the fourth quarter was 3.09%, up 15 basis points
from the third quarter. The taxable portfolio, which averaged $12 billion, up approximately $534 million from the
prior quarter, had a yield of 2.41%, up 21 basis points from the prior quarter, impacted by the higher yields on
recently purchased agency MBS securities. Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averages about $8.1 billion during
the fourth quarter, up about $193 million from the third quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.17%, up 8
basis points from the prior quarter.

At the end of the fourth quarter, approximately 76% of the municipal portfolio was pre-funded or PSF-insured. The
duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.8 years, up from 5.3 years at the end of
the third quarter impacted by the extended duration of our agency MBS securities in this higher rate environment.
Looking at deposits, on a linked quarter basis, average deposits were down $1 billion or 2.3% with about half of
the decrease coming from demand deposits and half coming from interest bearing deposits. Customer repos for
the fourth quarter averaged $3.6 billion, up $1.6 billion from the $2 billion average in the third quarter. We have
seen some deposit flows into our repo product during the quarter.
Total combined deposits and customer repos in the fourth quarter averaged $48.3 billion, up $571 million from the
prior quarter. The cost of interest bearing deposits for the quarter was 1.16%, up 54 basis points from the third
quarter.
Regarding credit loss expense, during the fourth quarter, we booked credit loss expense of $3 million, which
represents the first quarter we booked at credit loss expense this year. The credit loss expense was driven by
growth in unfunded commitments. Unfunded commitments grew $698 million during the quarter, ending at $12.5
billion at the end of the year.
Looking at noninterest income on a linked quarter basis, trust and investment management fees were up $1.1
billion or 3%, as increases in estate fees of $1.6 million, investment fees of $860,000 and real estate fees of
$529,000 were partly offset by a decrease in oil and gas fees, down $2 million due to lower commodity prices.
Service charges on deposit accounts were down $639,000 or 2.8%, primarily as a result of lower commercial
service charges, down $1.5 million, largely resulting from a higher earnings credit rate on annualized balances.
Partially offsetting this decrease was a $756,000 increase in combined consumer and commercial overdraft
charges. Insurance commissions and fees were down $1.5 million or 11.2% from the third quarter as a result of
lower life insurance commissions, which were down $706,000 and also impacted by our normal business cycle.
Other income was up $7.1 million, primarily due to a $5.1 million distribution received from an SBIC investment.
Regarding total noninterest expenses, total noninterest expense was up $23.4 million or 9.1% compared to the
third quarter. The primary drivers were salaries and wages up $9.5 million or 7.5%, and other expenses up $13.3
million or 29.2% compared to the third quarter. The increase in salary and wages was impacted by a $6.4 million
increase in stock compensation as those stock awards are made in October of every year, and some, by their
nature, are expensed immediately.
Additionally, accrued incentives were up $1 million from the prior quarter. The increase in other noninterest
expense of $13.3 million was impacted by higher fraud-related losses of $4.7 million, $4 million related to a
licensing negotiation and marketing and advertising up $2.7 million, which is typically higher in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our projection of full year 2023 total noninterest expenses, we expect total noninterest expense for the
full year 2023 to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens over our 2022 reported level. Our continued
expansion in Houston and Dallas and the introduction of our mortgage product accounts for about 2.5% of that
projected growth. Also impacting the projected growth rate is significant investments that we will be making in
information technology for both people and infrastructure, investments in marketing in both advertising and people
as we focus on expanding the communication of our value proposition and expense growth is also impacted by
costs associated with continued support of our staff.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 13% or about 13.8% excluding discrete items. Our current
expectation is that our full year effective tax rate for 2023 should be in the range of about 14.5% to 15.5%, but
that can be affected by discrete items during the year. Regarding the estimates for full year 2023 earnings, our
current projections include a 25 basis point Fed rate increase in February, followed by a 25 basis point decrease
in July. Given those rate assumptions and the 2023 non-interest expense growth of mid-teens, we currently
believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates of $10.89 is reasonable.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just first wanted to follow up on remarks around, Phil, around commercial real estate. So you noted two things.
One, you mentioned the impact from rate hikes was having an impact on the pipeline cooling off. But at the same
time, we talked about the strength of your book. But give us just – like how do you see this playing out if interest
rates don't get cut, one. And maybe this may not play out at first, but do you see credit pain in the sector across
your markets to manifest themselves over the next 12 months across multifamily, office? And how do you think
that translates to impacting cash flow for your customers? Maybe it has a pressure on rent rolls as we look out?
Would love some color on that and just your thought process around both the risk for the market, and how it may
come back and translate in terms of risk to Frost? Thank you.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Okay. Thanks, Ebrahim. Well, we are seeing some tightening on debt service coverage ratios, as I mentioned.
But we don't expect, let's take, multifamily, for example, to be underwater on those. The word that I got from our
credit people was, I'll quote is, so we feel pretty good about it. If you look at – I think I gave you what our loan-to-
value on offices was, it was about 56%. If you look at our loan-to-value on multifamily, it's 58%. About half of our
deals are – will be completed in 2023, the other half in 2024. So I don't think there's a lot of pressure today as it
relates to our portfolio. I also hear from our people that rents are keeping up for now, so that's helping things, but
costs are also increasing.
I think in this market it's − if you have issues, it's been kind of what everyone's been hearing, it's going to be the
lower class office buildings where you've got – you're losing tenants and you've got some risk around that. But I
didn't want to give − I don't want to give the feeling that we've got problems. I just want to make sure I'm being
honest if things are tightening up. If you took a look at our portfolio, I was asking about, I guess, the office
portfolio. I think we have $44 million of what might be problem credits on what is the portfolio, it's probably over $1
billion, right?
So you don't really have much that are issues and they're kind of specific. But – so again, I don't want to give the
impression things are too negative, but I do want to give the impression things are not as good as they were. I
would also say that, property tax is a big problem around here and they've seen a big increase. So when you
combine that with interest rates and then also operating costs on apartments, multifamily. It's going to create
some pressure, but at this point not so much. Again, offices are probably the biggest concern, I'd say, generally in
the market, because I don't think anybody's figured out what's going to happen with offices over the next couple of
years. We're still trying to figure it out as a business. So I'm sorry I don't have any better clarity in that, but that's
what we're seeing, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
No that's helpful color. And then one, Jerry, you mentioned about the earnings outlook for the year. Give us a
sense of what you expect in terms of net interest income growth for the year and how you see that trending? Do
you expect NII continues to grow given just what you expect in terms of loan and deposit growth? Or do you see
some trajectory where NII declines quarterly at some point in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, sure. I think that – I said last quarter, we got a little bit into 2023 and we were talking about the NIM
percentage. I think that we're currently – I don't expect that the fourth quarter was our peak. I still think that
obviously we had a nice increase between the third and fourth quarter, 30 basis points. I don't see that sort of a
growth coming into the first quarter. But certainly, we do expect some improvement. And in my mind, I think given
our assumptions that we'll see a rate increase in February and then a decrease in July, I would expect that our
NIM is probably – given our assumptions, probably peaks in the third quarter.
As far as, we're not going to give specific percentage growth on net interest income. But it's – year-over-year, I
think we grew between 2021 and 2022, say, 30%. I don't think we'll be there based on kind of what I'm seeing.
But I think we're going to have strong growth this year compared to last.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hi, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the deposit side. So the outflows of noninterest bearing were fairly sharp, a bit more than we
were looking for. And I know you mentioned repos, but could you give it a little bit more color what you saw in the
quarter? What you might still see a risk of moving out of noninterest bearing? And where do you see that mix
stabilize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, noninterest-bearing, I think, what I said on the noninterest bearing is that's really been kind of the
area that I've been concerned about that we had some exposure there. And I continue to think that's really the
area where we have the most exposure. With rates where they're at today, and we all know there's some pretty
nice rates out there, I think that it really is compelling a lot of treasurers and CFOs to make sure that they're
managing their liquidity well and looking for alternatives. I think that certainly we can be competitive in a lot of
situations, but there's probably going to be cases where we're going to see some deposit outflow on, especially
on some of the larger balances, especially, I think that's where most of the risk is.
I don't think it's anywhere unique to anybody. I think that from a deposit rate standpoint, our rates, I think, are
competitive with banks. So I think the challenge becomes trying to compete with some alternative sources. But I
do expect that the commercial side on the commercial DDA is probably the most at risk in my mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, Jerry, in terms of the loan-to-deposit ratio, moved up slightly through 2022. I hear where
you're saying I'm putting liquidity to work in the securities book. But should we expect a similar trend through
2023, just basically funding loan growth with deposit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that for 2023, I think that probably the bigger unknown in my mind is more of what happens on the deposit
side than what happens on the loan side. I think Phil has given some good color of what we're seeing in loans. I

think without knowing exactly what happens in the economy, there might be a little uncertainty there. But I think
we feel pretty confident. I think it's that deposit side. So you could because we've always said the loan-to-deposit
ratio from our standpoint is really a results, in fact, right, because we're really out to grow both deposits from a
relationship standpoint and loans. So I think that given that I don't project that we'll have the sort of increase in
deposits that we've had the last couple of years, I expect that to be much more muted in 2023. You may get some
improvement in that ratio just simply because the denominator decreases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then finally, on the expense side, so you reported mid-teens expense growth 2022, basically in
line with what you had guided for the year, now guiding mid-teens for 2023 and more investments that you'll have
to make. When you guys take a longer-term view, do you think for a period of time, we just – beyond 2023, we
stay in this mid-teens range? Or do you see this as sort of a two-year scenario and then we get back to something
more normal after that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Steve, it's a good question. I think the simple answer is 2023 is an unusual year for us. I expect to see our run
rate on expense growth to go down in 2024. And Jerry mentioned the IT investments, mentioned marketing. I've
been – as I've talked to investors over the last couple of years, I've been pretty open that there are some things
we're going to invest in. We're going to invest in physical distribution, and I hope by now we've proved to
everyone that that's a payoff for shareholders who're going to continue to be – we're going to continue to do that.
We sort of set that aside, okay?
But we're also going to invest in people. And you saw those numbers on salaries. I mean, they're pretty sobering,
but we were competing in the marketplace. I think we're being successful there. I think we've reached a place
where we're touching bottom. And I was looking at our turnover rates, last year, it was – in 2021, our turnover was
20% – call it, 23%. This year, it was – excuse me, in 2022, it was 14%. It was down from 23% in 2021.
So that tells me that we are hitting the right balance of what we need to be paying people. We've done a lot on
benefits, making sure that we have comparative and really top quality benefits in areas of healthcare and
retirement and those kind of things. So we're really focused on that.
We said that we're going to invest in marketing that, that was one area that we really hadn't done – one of the key
areas that we hadn't done. We needed to. And we've hired some great talent there. We did that last year, and we
are – so we've got those costs, but we've also got some additional media that we're going to be investing in and
we need to.
And look, I think we've been winning on account growth and growing the business, and I think we've done it
without kind of – well, we'll sort of with the marketing hand tied behind our back, I think we get that out from
behind our back is going to really help us. So I'm optimistic about that.
And then the third one or the fourth one that we said we're going to be investing in is IT and cyber. And that's the
big number that Jerry is talking about because we are – as we looked at this and did our planning for this year, we
really call this a generational investment in IT. And it's really, I'd say, around – if I – if you're interested, I'd d break
it down into say three areas. One is customer experiences and growth, which really revolve a lot around digital,
mobile, for the consumer and commercial businesses. We are almost doubling our number of digital agile teams.
We're going from 6 to 11, 2 of them in the commercial area. We're speeding up modernization on certain core

systems. There are three of them. We need a new loan system. We need to invest in real-time payments, which is
a developing competitive issue and we need to take care of our check processing system, which is at end of life.
We are a big correspondent bank provider. So check – yeah, checks are going away, but they're not gone and we
process a lot of them. So that's probably 35% in terms of that core modernization.
And then we need to continue to expand our efforts on, I'll call it, information security and fraud mitigation, that's
probably the other 15%, and that's a big percentage increase. We've increased IT. Let's see. We've been 11% for
2019 and 2020 and 2022. It was up 8% in 2021. We really backed down expenses all over the bank that year. But
in 2023, we're looking for a 24% increase in IT-related expenses. And that's a generational investment in
necessary IT. And I say it's necessary because remember our success at competing, and I believe we're winning
at the organic growth competition is from an empathetic customer service experience and from great technology,
and we can't sleep on that technology piece.
Now, having said all that, I don't believe those are investments that we're going to have to make at the same level
as we look in the next year, in 2024. So it is – it's a big number. We hate spending money. We hate wasting it
even worse. And so we don't think we're doing that. But we do need to do this to compete where we are, and I
think we'll see that run rate go down as we hit 2024 and beyond.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick one on the NII guide. I was curious what the impact is you see for the
rate hike in February and then the rate cut in July with the NIM sensitivity is for those moves that you're baking in.
And it sounded like you're assuming a positive but maybe more muted deposit growth trend for the year. I was
just wondering if you could give an update on the total deposit beta assumption you're now baking into that?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. I guess, I'll just start with the deposit betas. I mean, I think we ended up the year kind of where we
expected we would be. We had said that we'd be about 30% on interest-bearing and about 20% – 20% to 25% on
total. And that's really kind of where we ended up. So I think for – we were higher in the fourth quarter. I think I
said in the third quarter that I thought we have be a little bit more aggressive than we were, but we ended up
cumulatively exactly where we expected.
In the fourth quarter – as far as betas for next year or for this year, excuse, I mean, I think basically, what we're
assuming is that we would have the same sort of increase that we had in the first quarter and February is kind of
where we'd go back. I think we're assuming a little bit more aggressive betas, say, where we were at about 30%

on interest-bearing. I think we're probably assuming right now that we'd be somewhere closer to the 33% to 35%.
And then our assumptions are that we take all that back in July, and we'll just have to see. I think we said all along
is we want to see kind of where the market is, but those are our current assumptions today.
And I think you had one other question on the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Just on the sensitivity to the rate moves that you guys are looking at, the hike in February, and then the cut
in July, how much that will you think will move the NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. From a NIM standpoint, I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on the percentage itself. Like I
said, I don't – we want to be careful. We don't really give all that sort of level detailed guidance. But what I have
said is, I do think the percentage will peak in the third quarter, just right before our projected decrease. And I think
that we're feeling good about where we're at a lot. A lot of it will be dependent on what happens on those
deposits.
As I've said, yeah, we do – I feel like it's a little bit more muted in 2023 than it was in 2022. Yeah, most certainly. I
mean, I think we saw some of that just in the linked-quarter movement, although a lot of it was moving into repo.
And so, we had certain customers coming out of the money market account and choosing to move into the repo
account because of some sort of operational processes and money flow issues that they that they liked more in
the repo and also the fact that that product is collateralized. So we did see some movement there. So I tend to
have less concerns, although it's still going to be relatively soft – it's going to be softer than we saw this year on
the interest-bearing side, but most of the risk is on the commercial DDA in my opinion. As far as what we think a
25-basis-point hike gives us, it gives us about, on a pre-tax basis, a little over $3 million a quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. And maybe just one last quick one. On the 1.59 times debt service coverage ratio you gave on the
office book, that's an updated figure for today's rates. Is that right?

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes. That's where we stand on average today.

Hey, Dave. I just want to make sure. When I said around a little over 3%, that's on an after-tax basis. I couldn't
remember if I said pre-tax or after-tax.

Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.

Hey, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start with your comment about growing the bond portfolio. I think on a net basis of about $2.2 billion in
2023, right? If you look at the amount of cash that Frost still has, at least on an average basis in the fourth
quarter, it was 24% of average earning assets. It feels like you could do potentially more than the $2 billion adding
to the bond book, especially as the rates are more attractive today? Is there some possible upside to the amount
of bonds that you will consider adding in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that – yeah, that's a possibility, obviously. Right now, what we're really concerned with is it's just making
sure we understand exactly what's going on with deposits. I guess, what I'd say is that it's something that we're
talking about. Should we get the opportunity, if we think something, we get an opportunity on the yield side with
some sort of market correction, we could jump in. But – so there is that possibility. But I think right now, we're
really – the numbers that we're giving is really kind of the way we're modeling. Like I said, it's – I never say never
sort of thing. But I'd go with our projections.
I don't expect – let's not forget that in 2022, we spent $8.6 billion, I think, gross. And in that year, we only had a
little over $8.6 billion. We only had a little bit over $1 million in inflows. So net, we spent $7.5 billion. So we've
moved the needle quite a bit. And so we've made some purchases already in the – in January of this year of $1
billion, I think roughly. So, could we – yeah, I don't see that as a high probability at this point. But yeah, that's
always a possibility given what happens in the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then my second question is on mortgage. As that relatively new unit gets up and running for you guys,
I think that's an originated keep model, not an originated sell model. So is that business continues to mature? Do

you think that that will push the loan growth outlook beyond the high-single-digit just because you'll have that new
lever of loan growth as you keep those mortgages?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good question, Brady. I don't know if it goes above high-single digits, but it will be additive to it. I don't really have
it in my mind enough to know how much that would move the needle. But yeah, it's going to be a significant part
of the portfolio. The way I hope it turns out is if you look five years out, it'd be 10-ish percent of the portfolio back
when we used to have them on the book before, I think we were around that area, 10%, 12% of the portfolio. So, I
just think directionally we'd be in that same level. So, if you kind of took what would that be and what kind of
volumes would that be, you could sort of pencil out how much that might add to growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. I had a quick follow-up on the expense side. Are these expenses that you have pretty much
set in stone for 2023? Or do you have some flexibility depending on which way the overall environment goes?
And then I also had a clarification on your comments on the run rate moving lower. Do you think that basically the
growth rate moves lower off of the new expense base in 2023 as you go into 2024? Or do you think as you get
the new launch system and check processing system, et cetera, running and the old one rolls up that the actual
dollars can stabilize or come down as you go into 2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, my comments really weren't intended to indicate that the dollars would come down because, obviously,
we're growing company. We're going to continue to invest. My point is that I don't see us investing at the same
level with some of these. I mean, for example, I didn't mention it but take mortgage. We have bootstrapped that
operation. We spent some serious money doing it. It's a fantastic product. It's going to be a tremendous product
for us going forward. But we don't have to rebuild that next year, right? So we're going to have that same level of
cost structure and it'll be higher because of inflation and growth, that kind of thing. But we're not going to have to
bootstrap it.
So that's really what I'm pointing out. I think we're making a lot of these generational investments that we're really
going to be trying to harvest and we'll be dealing more with an increasing expense base, but just not increasing at
the same level that we have been. That's my hope. That's what we're going to try to manage to.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Perfect. And then, a follow-up on the product questions on the securities book. I guess, even if you
don't get a market correction opportunity to make larger purchases here. Given that we've come off the highs in
yields, what would change your strategy to maybe accelerate some of the investments in that securities book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that if we felt like there was a correction that was significant that got our attention, I think that we
would accelerate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And any thoughts on what, once the Fed begins to cut rates, what your cash position should look like as a
percentage of earning asset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's really not – we've kind of been all over the board. I think the thing is today, we've got – you're right, we've got
more liquidity than we have had. I think that we feel comfortable being able to bring that down to something much
more normalized. But we don't have a number out there. A lot of it is going to be dependent on what we're seeing.
I think if you've got, say, something in the – as far as earning assets are concerned, something in the range of
10% or lower, I mean, I think we could be at some point in that range.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. So you guys are always sitting on very strong capital ratios, low credit risk. I was just
curious what your thought is on share buybacks. I know it's not a focus, but what are your thoughts on share
buybacks here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It's really not something that's top of mind, to be quite honest with you. I think that, right now, we really don't
even have one in place. I think our – we had $100 million one that expired. We expect that we'll bring that back
into the toolbox here in the near future. But we had one for all of 2022. We didn't utilize it. We've got it primarily to
ensure that if we did see some market correction on our stock that we'd be in a position to take advantage of that.
But right now, I think from a multiple standpoint, I think we feel that that capital is better served through organic
growth. And I think there were some concerns – not that we were concerned, but I think the market had some

concerns about tangible capital. And given that concern, some of the questions we were getting, I can't see that
we'd pull the trigger any time soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then just on office space, Phil, I heard your comments, most of your exposure's to the A-type
properties. But I was just wondering if you could comment what you're seeing on the B and C properties in like
Houston and Dallas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It just – there really aren't many that have come to my radar portfolio wise that I know of. That's going to –
because that's going to depend on sponsorship, guarantees, equity, all those kinds of things, right? So – but I can
just tell you that what you're seeing all over the country is that the B and C properties just are hard to get people
into. And I can imagine there are some issues out there. It's – I don't have anything that's more complex than that,
just recognition that people aren't using as much office space and it better be nice if you're going to try to get
employees to go into it.

scratched off and Peter just took one of them. But you made a comment earlier, Phil, about the prospect pipeline
versus your own pipeline and the difference between the two. Can you just talk about that a little bit more and
maybe that's more of a competitive environment question, but help us understand them a little bit more? Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Yeah. We are getting lots of calls for deals, right, because we've got liquidity, we've got consistent underwriting.
People know what we do in the marketplace. And as far as that goes, underwriting is tightening up. It's coming our
way as far as guarantees and equity and all that kind of stuff. But my point was – and I should also say that we
don't – we're not looking to do all those deals. We bank people, not things, right? And we bank relationships. So –
but there might be some relationships that we've been wanting to have that we'll see the opportunity to do, okay?
And we're always on the lookout for that. And now the phone rings more. So we see prospect activity to me is
more – it's more the advantage of us having the balance sheet that we do and reputation we do.
But my point on our customers, to me, it's kind of like same store sales. I know it's not that. But I mean, you
already have the customers and you're going to – and the deals you have in the pipeline for them are the deals
they're looking to do, their new deals they're looking to do, right? They're not necessarily deals that are out there
that have already been papered, already been – that are in the marketplace that you might see with the prospect.
So my point is, as I looked at it, to me it was like, okay, our customers, we've got their business. If we're not
seeing new deals from them, it's because they're not doing new deals. And – or they're slower on them. But we
are still seeing good prospect deals that are out there in the marketplace just because of the advantages that we
have. Is that – maybe I'm off on that, but that's...

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. That's helpful. And then just one other thing on the step-up and IT and security expenses. Are you
saying that's a permanent step-up or it's just kind of modernization and core spending-related just for 2023? Are
we talking about a growth rate in expenses flowing in 2024 or expenses kind of flattening out and coming down in
2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, its growth rate. It's a growth rate coming down. I mean, once we bake this into our base expense load,
I mean, it's staying in there. And there'll be some growth on it because inflation and all those kind of things. But it's
– but we won't be having to do the same thing. Again, our growth rate for four out of the last five years or three out
of the last four years before this year has been 11%. So – and IT is a cost that is – it used to be health care was
the out of control cost. I think it's clearly IT these days. And – but we'll need to get it back down to those more
historical levels.
