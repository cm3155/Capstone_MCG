Thank you, Sal. Good morning and welcome to our earnings announcement, strategic plan update and forecast
call. As we go through this transition year in 2024, we will continue to provide updates about the company
including forecast. We feel it's important for our investors to be informed and along for the journey as we build a
strong, performing bank. When we met last May 1, Craig and I had been in our positions for roughly four weeks.
Now that we've had an additional 90 days, we feel we understand the company and have put it on a path to
success. We have a firm hand on the steering wheel of the company and excited to be in the position that we are
today. This has been a very busy quarter for us and we feel like we've accomplished a lot of great things.
In addition to our second quarter results earlier this morning, we announced a significant transaction, the sale of
our mortgage servicing businesses and third-party origination platform to Mr. Cooper, one of the country's leading
mortgage companies. We have also had a strong relationship with Mr. Cooper both from a banking relationship
and knowing a number of the personnel. So we do view this will be a good and easy transition of our important
assets into the company. This comes on top of our announcement on Monday that we closed on the sale of our
mortgage warehouse loans to JPMorgan Chase. We discussed that at our last earnings call, did not identify that
transaction by name, but that has now closed. We received $5.9 billion of liquidity on Monday. There's roughly
$200 million that should close over the next 30 days. Both of these sales are important milestones for us as we
look to simplify our business model and strengthen our balance sheet. And as we will highlight later, collectively,
these two transactions, we feel, bolster our liquidity and increase our capital ratios.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Last quarter, we laid out the strategic initiatives for the company. This quarter, I want to update you on the status
of those initiatives. Starting with slide 3, you can see we have made significant progress during our transition year
on each of the five strategies outlined on page 3. Under the first, we conducted and completed our board
transformation. I'm happy to report, I think, we have one of the strongest boards in the industry today. I've had the
opportunity over the last 120 days to observe them in action. They are an active board. They challenge
management and they have established a very high standard for performance and execution. And I think that's
one of the hallmarks of any great organization is a very complete and solid board. In addition to that, during the
quarter, we added nine additional senior executives to our executive and leadership team. This brings to the total
of 16 new executives to date to the organization. I'll remind people on the call, we did this within a five-month
period and I'll talk a little bit more on slide 5 when we get to about the level of that talent.
As far as our ongoing execution of our operating plan, we had very strong deposit growth during the quarter. Our
deposits grew 5.6%. It was a very solid result both in our private banking and our retail banking franchise. As we
commented, we diversified and are strengthening our balance sheet. We exited two non-core businesses, as I
described, and we feel we are on track to meet the expense targets in our forecast which will be over $300 million
of net cost takeouts while we continue to build our risk infrastructure and our C&I platform as we move forward.
On item number 3, achievable capitals and earnings forecast. The strategic sales will add about 130 basis points
to our CET ratio. We pro forma this at a CET of 11.2% which we feel is at and above our peers. And we also had
an incremental improvement in NIM and NII to loan portfolio pricing in the future and the increases to our C&I
business. On the improved funding profile, our pro forma liquidity post the transactions will be roughly $40 billion.
This results in over 300% coverage ratio to our uninsured deposits and the transactions provide a net about $6.5
billion of liquidity to the organization through divestitures and deposit growth.
As we talked about in the call in May, there's been a lot of focus on the credit risk management in the company.
We now are through roughly 75% of our CRE portfolio. That was roughly 35% in the first quarter. We continue to
address problem loans through additional charge-offs and our ACL build up to 1.78%. And we're very focused on
the remediation of problem loans and I'll add some comments to that on a couple of slides later. And then we also
have begun to add talent and resources in this area. We hired a new head of our workout group during the
quarter, which is one of the talented people we feel in the industry.
Moving on to slide 4, you can see on slide 4 there are key takeaways for the quarter which we think were really
solid. As I commented, we have meaningful enhancements in liquidity and capital. We grew our deposits in key
areas of key focus which includes our retail and private bank. Since we had a chance to discuss [ph] that
(00:08:46), I've done a fair amount of branch visits. We visited branches in Arizona, Michigan and Florida. We've
rebranded all of the branches between November and March. We have a very consistent theme to colors and
messaging in the branches, and I was very impressed with our branch personnel with their outward, mobility-
seeking customers and a very focused goals and objectives. I think not only are we seeing as we commented on
strong deposit growth, but we're also seeing very strong referrals to our investment activities as well.
We had meaningful CRE payoffs. As we commented before, one of the strategic goals of the company is to shrink
our CRE exposure to roughly $45 billion and we have a long-term goal to get that into the $30 billion to $33 billion
level to give us diversification on the balance sheet. As Craig will talk about on slide 10, we do continue to have
payoffs in the CRE portfolio. We were down on an annualized basis from the first to the second quarter, about
10%. But just as importantly of those payoffs, 50% of those were in the classified categories. So we continue to
see both payoffs and reductions through payoffs in the classified categories.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
As far during the quarter, we've talked about – during the first quarter, we had to quickly gone through the largest
loans in the portfolio. We took further actions on the loan portfolio this quarter. We are now through 75% of the
CRE portfolio, 80% of the office and 80% of the multi-family. And just as important, we also kind of lean forward
because one of the big questions is how are the rapid rate increases impacting portfolios and credit quality? We
did an 18-month look forward on the portfolio that we re-underwrote the loans, those loans that had a debt service
coverage of 1:1. We then ordered appraisals and the end result of that is if the debt service coverage and the loan
to values were below – above 90%, we move those loans into the classified section. So that kind of look forward
pulls a lot of that risk into our current numbers and we feel that that is one of the reasons why we've seen an
increase both in our criticized and our classified and our non-accruals. And I'll just make a comment that over
60% of those loans that are substandard today are still performing. So we still have a very high percentage of
both our classified and our non-accrual loans that are continuing to perform. And I think that's an indication that
we are having a forward-looking at the risk that's coming down the pipeline in the portfolio.
As we commented, we continue to look at non-core businesses for us. We probably have another additional $2
billion to $5 billion that we're evaluating whether we would exit those businesses. We do plan to probably move on
some of that activity between now and the end of the year. In most of those instances, that would provide an
additional $200 million to $500 million of additional unallocated capital and $2 billion to $5 billion of liquidity. So
we'll continue to look at bolstering both the liquidity and the capital on the balance sheet.
And then lastly, we really started to build, I think, positive momentum in the C&I franchise. This is a big focus for
us. We're roughly around $20 billion of C&I assets. Our goal is to get that $30 billion to $35 billion in the next three
to five years. We've done this before at other institutions. We're an experienced group of people. We're hiring
experienced people to execute on this business plan. And we're very optimistic as a new entrant into the general
specialized lending, middle market lending, the type of people we're hiring will give us immediate access to
opportunities in those spaces.
Turning to page 5, really kind of gives you a reflection of really the very strong and experienced team that we've
accumulated at the bank. As I indicated, basically in five months, we've recruited what I consider to be one of the
strongest midsized banking teams in the industry today. These are across a wide variety of disciplines. I'll
highlight a couple on that page. The second on the left from the top is Kris Gagnon. Kris brings over 35 years of
very strong experience, risk management and credit management to our team. Kris was appointed this week to
be the Chief Credit Officer. He's been on staff with us for about five months in a consulting role. We're really
pleased to have Kris and bringing the disciplines into the credit organization. I think that will have a big impact.
And then on the far right, the second one down is Rich Raffetto. Rich has joined us to lead both our C&I and our
private banking initiatives. Rich also is a very senior executive, very well known in the industry. Rich and I worked
together at U.S. Bank and he's joined our organization from City National. I couldn't be more pleased to have Rich
on the board and some of the leadership that he's going to bring to those two disciplines where we do view the
private bank and the C&I as some of our biggest growth engines as we try to move forward in expanding the
organization.
On page 6, very busy quarter as we announced the [indiscernible] (00:14:42) in addition to the Mr. Cooper. But I
would like to just take for a second and focus on what are we going to look like in the future. And really, our focus
is on being a retail bank, a small business, that we provide residential mortgages to our customers and prospects
that come out of retail banking, private banking and commercial. We focus on our commercial, industrial and our
commercial real estate, and that's really what we would define as our core businesses going into the future. But
as I said, these two very well-run businesses we had – they were attractive acquisitions for people that are in
these businesses. The mortgage warehouse, as I said, will generate $6.1 billion. We sold those loans at par and
we added approximately through that transaction 70 basis points in CET1 capital ratio. And we will use those
5

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
proceeds to pay down our wholesale borrowings and fund future C&I growth, as one of our other objectives is,
obviously, to reduce overall the wholesale borrowings.
As we announced this morning, at closing, we will add 60 basis points through the mortgage servicing sale. This
will help reduce our high cost and volatile mortgage deposits. This is a $1.4 billion all-cash transaction. We sold
$1.2 billion of assets and subservicing business at a premium to book value and we do expect this to close in
2024.
So with that, I will turn it over to Craig and then look forward to answering questions during the Q&A period.

Craig E. Gifford
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Joseph. We'll move forward and talk to some of the numbers including a deeper dive on some of the
credit position analysis. If we move to slide 7, you can see that our CET1 ratio has converted and pro forma for
the business transaction, as Joseph mentioned, is 11.2%. So that's a 9.54% CET1 actual, about 30 basis points
for the assumed conversion of the remainder of the preferred stock from the March capital raise. There were two
items that were gating items for that, one was the shareholders approving in June an increase in our authorized
shares. That's been approved and the second, is there's some regulatory approvals associated with some of
those preferred shareholders converting to common. Once received, that will increase our capital ratio roughly 30
basis points.
And then as Joseph mentioned, about 70 basis points increment associated with the warehouse portfolio. That's
about $6 billion on the balance sheet in held for sale this quarter and we did receive that cash in the final closing
of that earlier this week. And then separately, the mortgage servicing business will get us about an increase of
about 60 basis points in CET1 and that's a result of the removal of roughly $1.2 billion on balance sheet carrying
asset for the mortgage servicing rights, which is a pretty high risk-weighted asset and then a small gain on the
transaction associated with the premium that we received on the business.
We don't have a whole lot of unrealized losses on our securities. You can see that our CET1 ratio adjusted for the
unrealized loss on securities at 10.4%. That's fairly strong compared to our Category IV peers. And then Joseph
mentioned the cash and liquidity position. There are slides further back that I'll go through in detail, but we do find
ourselves in a fairly strong liquidity position, which is nice to have.
On page 8, we've adjusted our forecast for the transactions that we spoke about. If you recall last quarter, we had
mentioned that there was a potential for an asset transaction. That was the warehouse transaction. Those
numbers were not included adjusted for in the forecast. We were clear about that and then separately now we
have the mortgage business transaction and those are now reflected in this forecast.
You see that the result of the transactions is that we push out our expectation of achieving peer median returns
about two quarters into the second quarter of 2027 as we redeploy the capital into lending businesses in 2026
and 2027 that's generated from those transactions. You see on the slide that our tangible book value per share
will be between $17.50 and $18 per share at the end of 2024. And as we look out into 2026 and 2027, we see
that growing into the $20 to $21 share range and those numbers exclude the impact of warrants. There is an
impact that we do have to think about on a long-term basis in terms of the share count that would come from the
warrants.
On the forecast page, on page 9, you can see that our net interest income shows growth and as does our net
interest margin. That's principally a result of the resetting of our loan portfolio to more current interest rates. As
6


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
those loans get their reset dates over the next couple of years, we'll have a metric in a couple of slides that shows
you the significance of that impact as we're rolling through the next few quarters.
From a provision expense standpoint, we'll have a slide at the end that has our experience for the quarter. We did
record $390 million of provision expense for the quarter. $350 million of that was charge-offs. The result of that is
that given where we are today, year-to-date from a provision expense, we do expect that our provision expense
for the year will wind up between $900 million and $1 billion in total for 2024. Because we do expect loan growth,
we do have an anticipation that we'll have increased provisioning not only through 2025 related to current market
conditions, but into 2026 as we have loan growth in the C&I portfolio and have to provision for that loan growth.
If you turn to slide 10, we can start to talk about some of the credit results and one of the things that we have
seen for the last several quarters is really strong results in terms of payoff on our CRE portfolio. So, as we have
loans that are hitting reset dates and maturity dates, we're certainly working to retain those borrowers where we
have relationships, where they bring those deposits, but those borrowers are simply using our balance sheet. As
they hit reset dates, we're working to reduce our exposure to and our concentration on commercial real estate and
by helping those borrowers find ways to move off the balance sheet.
We had almost $1 billion in CRE payoffs in the quarter, and you can see that three-fourths of that was from multi-
family. And also, shown on the right-hand side, the amount of that was in our classified portfolio. So, as Joseph
mentioned, we've been pretty aggressive at looking at the ability of borrowers to repay and moving loans to
classified over the last couple of quarters, but those borrowers are able to find options in the marketplace as they
come to their reset dates. And over almost half of the payoffs this quarter were out of our classified portfolio, and
all of those payoffs were at par. So, they weren't discounted payoffs.
On slide 11 is an update with respect to our portfolio review. As Joseph mentioned, last quarter, we had made our
way through – we've only been here a few weeks, but we made our way through about 37% of the portfolio, $18
billion. At this point, we're through about 75% of the portfolio, and that includes 80% of the multi-family portfolio,
total of $33 billion in principal balance that we've done detailed review on.
You can see that broken out by portfolio towards the bottom. We continue to be at a very high level with respect
to office. Only about $500 million of the office portfolio remains under review. The multi-family portfolio, only about
$7 billion remains in review and in a couple of slides, we have detail on that. And it's principally smaller balance
loans, which generally we've seen to have less risk.
On page 12, our multi-family portfolio, you can see that year-over-year we're down 4%, but importantly, as I
mentioned, we had $700 million of payoffs in the quarter. From a quarterly perspective, we're down 3% just in a
singular quarter and we do expect that trend to continue. On the next page, I'll show you how much it hits reset
dates over the next two years and as we move forward, we expect to continue to encourage those borrowers to
find other options.
Over the past 18 months, we had $2.9 billion, almost $3 billion of our multi-family rent- regulated loans that have
hit their reprice dates and as I mentioned, strong payoffs there. Almost a fourth of those loans have paid off. 69%
have repriced and this is an important statistic. When they reprice, they reprice to an average of 8.19%. That's up
from 3.85%. That trend will continue and that'll have a significant upside into our net interest margin on a go-
forward basis.
In the second quarter, we did receive our annual updates from borrowers for their financial statements. We have
over 80% of the portfolio that we've received annual updates on and interestingly, on average, the NOIs on those
7


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
updates are up year-over-year. About two-thirds of the loans have increased NOIs and about a third have
decreased NOIs, on average, increasing between 3% and 5%.
On slide 13 is more detail on the multi-family portfolio. Again, there's about $4.7 billion that remains under review.
I'm sorry, $6.9 billion that remains under review and you can see that the average loan balance on those is below
$5 million.
And then on the far right-hand side, bottom of the page, you can see that over the next couple of years, we have
roughly $5 billion that reprices in 2025 and 2026 and then out into 2027. That's roughly $7 billion of repricing, the
significant upside potential in margin as well as opportunity to decrease the concentration in CRE as we work
those loans off the balance sheet.
Our office portfolio on page 14, we had gotten through about 75% of the portfolio. Last quarter, we really focused
on that because that's where we have quite a bit of large balance loans that were also in a space that was
experiencing pretty significant market stress in terms of occupancy levels. We're through 82% now and the
remainder of the portfolio is only about $500 million or so.
The result of working through those loans, we did order and receive a lot of appraisals this quarter on those
properties, and that's resulted in a significant level of charge-offs this quarter. The reserve associated with the
remainder of the loans is 6.7%. It was between 10% and 11% last quarter, the difference there simply being the
charge-offs that we recorded for the expected level of loan loss on those loans.
On page 15, our non-office CRE portfolio. It's a pretty diversified set of loans. You can see that on the bottom left
that we have made our way through about 48% of the loans. So, the half that are remaining, they're very
diversified. You can also see the average balance is only $1.5 million and the vast majority of those are not New
York-related loans.
On page 16, Joseph mentioned that our allowance for loan loss is up to 1.7% of total portfolio. Our credit loss
reserve is up to 1.78% of the total portfolio. That's up from about 1.5%, with increases in the multi-family loans
and as I mentioned, the decrease in the allowance associated with office as a result of the charge-offs that we
recorded in the quarter.
Page 17 gives you some perspective around asset quality. Joseph mentioned we worked hard to identify those
problem loans, recognize them, and work towards resolution. On the bottom left-hand side, non-accrual loans
grew in the quarter just shy of $2 billion. That's a fairly significant increase, up from roughly $700 million in the first
quarter.
Our delinquency data had a spike in the second quarter, up to $1.2 billion, but subsequent to that, roughly $700
million of that has come current. So, the increase on the delinquencies is only up to about $500 million.
Importantly, on the non-accrual loans, well over half, 61% of those loans, are actually current on their payments,
in fact, from us on the CRE portfolio. 77% of the loans that are in non-accrual are actually current on their
payments. We've just been pretty aggressive at recognizing the potential impact of the market stresses on the
property values, which in many cases becomes the ultimate source of repayment.
On page 18, a really good news story from a deposits perspective, that we have been very successful on a
customer deposit raising perspective not only in our retail space where we have our premier products which had
an increase of about $3.2 billion for the quarter, but particularly in the private bank where there had been some
concerns associated with the departure of some of our private bankers. We've actually seen deposit growth in that
8


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
space and in that business, roughly $500 million quarter-over-quarter as our bankers have gotten out, really
connected with our customer base. And we're seeing return of dollars to the balance sheet as well as new
relationships.
Page 19 shows our liquidity profile. You can see the deposit-gathering success has significantly increased our
already strong liquidity position. The warehouse sale will bring us $6 billion. The mortgage sale will result in net
about a reduction of about $2.5 billion against that total of $40 billion of pro forma liquidity. We anticipate that we
will begin to redeploy some of that incremental liquidity into the reduction of warehouse [indiscernible] (00:28:41)
into the reduction of wholesale borrowings over the next 30 to 45 days or so.
Page 20 has our financial results for the quarter. You can see that our loss to shareholders for the quarter was
$333 million. That's principally driven by the provision for loan losses of $390 million. Again, that's $350 million of
charge-offs and roughly a $40 million reserve build.
Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 1.98%. We did have margin pressure from the interest reversals
associated with the non-accruals, pretty significant rise. Obviously, as I mentioned on non-accruals, that had
about a 7-basis point to 8-basis point negative impact on margin. And on a go-forward basis has about a 9-basis
point impact to carry those loans. And that impact is baked into the forecast numbers on the earlier pages over
the next couple of years.
Our balance sheet ended at $119 billion. That will go down in the third quarter as we close on the sale of
warehouse loans in the third quarter and then a bit of reduction associated with the mortgage transaction. And
that my expectation is that we would redeploy a good chunk of that cash into paying down debt on the balance
sheet.
So, overall, a summary that shares the story from a numbers perspective of moving forward to simplifying the
balance sheet, reducing operating risk, and positioning ourselves from a strong capital position as we go through
a period of uncertainty and then move into the opportunity to redeploy that capital into a more diversified balance
sheet and a focus on commercial lending in addition to the commercial real estate portfolio.
Joseph, I'll turn it back over to you.

Joseph M. Otting
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much, Craig. Appreciate the great overview.
On page 21, just wanted to highlight kind of our investment profile. Pro forma, New York Community Bank
currently trades at roughly 60% of fully converted tangible book value. This compares to 1.8% for Category IV
banks and 1.55% for banks and assets between $50 billion and $100 billion.
Our Q2 2024 tangible book value per share is $20.89 or $18.29 fully converted. We feel, as we successfully
execute our strategic plan to transform the company into a focused, diversified, high-performing regional bank,
that this valuation gap will close. As we've talked about, we have multiple levers to be able to kind of close this
valuation gap.
First of all, focusing the portfolio on relationship banking activities is one of the key and with that, we will diversify
the loan portfolio from being concentrated into real estate. We continue to increase the core relationship-based
deposits. Craig showed on the deposit page, we do have a significant portion of our deposits in both interest-
9

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
bearing and non-interest-bearing demand accounts, which is critical and as we grow the C&I business, that will
also bring a lower cost of deposits and diversification to that.
We also think that we can increase the level of fee income generated from fee-based businesses. Most of these
products are in the company today may need some enhancements, but we're talking about cash management,
interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange, 401(k), core banking products that we can offer and do a better job of
being able to provide to our customers.
And then lastly, we're very much focused on reducing and rationalize our cost structure. As we've communicated,
we do have a plan to take out $300 million independent of the mortgage activities of cost structure and we're well
on our way to achieving those cost reduction activities by the end of the year. That will allow us to enter 2025 on a
run rate that those cost reductions will already be in place.
So, overall, I think the progress this quarter was fantastic and really in a five-month period of time, I think we've
changed the culture. We clearly changed the quality of the people that are in the organization, the focus on the
credit risk within the portfolio, and as I commented that forward-looking of the portfolio, we think, gives us really
good insight to any risk that's coming down the pathway with interest rate movement or credit risk associated with
fixed charge coverage.
We also have gone through our annual review of the portfolio in the commercial real estate where we look at
every individual loan from the standpoint of their NOI and how does that work in relationship to their debt service
coverage today and with any potential future increases in interest rate. So, a lot of really good progress on behalf
of the team here. Great momentum, I think, amongst people in the bank. They can see the finish line that this
company can be a really successful regional bank and there's a lot of good energy and excitement not only from
ourselves and our employees, but also as we're out talking to our customers in the marketplace. People are
sharing that energy about Flagstar, New York Community Bank kind of rebounding back and being the bank that
we can support our customers.
So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator and we can open up for the Q&A period of the call.

I guess maybe – hi. Just to follow-up on the commercial real estate book, first, 80% of reviews done on office,
multi-family. A few questions there. One, you've given sort of outlook for provisioning and where the reserves are,
but give us a sense of the loss content in this book as you've gone through and where you are seeing those
charge-offs come through on the CRE book, number one.
And secondly, when you talked about loan repricing from 3% to 8%-plus, is that – I'm assuming triggering some
negotiation with the customer to sort of be paying down balances to kind of get LTVs, et cetera, in place. So, if
you could talk to both those aspects.

Yeah. So, I'll start on the last question. So, for the most part, when loans are repricing, we are holding the
customers to the rate options that are in the loan agreements. If they have strong deposit relationships or bring
other business to us, then we'll consider other options, but in general, we're holding them to terms in the loan
agreements, which is pushing them to look to other opportunities. And there are – for many of them, there are
opportunities in the market that are cheaper-priced than the loan agreements and where those happen, that's
where we're seeing the payoffs coming from. So, for the most part, we're not seeking paydowns, although in
certain cases, we'll consider that as a part of a structuring arrangement, particularly where it's a borrower that we
want to have a continuing relationship with.
From a charge-offs perspective, we had charge-offs principally associated with the office portfolio in the quarter,
some multi-family charge-offs, as you mentioned. As you repeated, we have made our way through quite a bit of
the multi-family portfolio in detail, 80% level. The remainder of the loans generally are smaller balance. Generally,
when we look at them, see lower loss levels, but as we received updated borrower financial information, we now
have a much more refreshed view in terms of the information about the loans and where the loans are close from
a debt service coverage on the repriced coupon level for those loans that are in the next 18 months. We're taking
a really hard look at those. We're generally downgrading those to substandard and we're getting appraisals on
those. And that has led to some charge-offs. It has the potential to leave to more over the next couple of quarters
as we get another slug of appraisals in.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Perfect. And on those payoffs, if you can talk to the appetite among the GSEs. One of the other banks talked
about they've seen a pick up in being able to move these things or getting refied with the agencies. Have you
seen that? And given what's happened to rates even in the last few days, do you think that could trigger even
more stuff refi-ing out of the bank to the agencies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we do and that's what we've seen, $700 million of payoffs in multi-family in the second quarter. We see that
continuing and that's a good thing. It helps us move towards our overall goal of reducing the concentration in
commercial real estate and we do have opportunities to redeploy that liquidity, including paying down debt. So,
we see that continuing over the next several quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. If I may sneak in one more for Joseph. You gave us sort of the medium term outlook of the company.
Given just all the moving pieces, just your own numbers, fourth quarter 2026 earnings went from $2.10 last
quarter to $1.65 this quarter. So, clearly, again, a lot of stuff going on. As we look at the announcements that you
made on the warehouse and the servicing, are we done in terms of just strategically realigning the balance sheet
and the company or could we see more of such actions taking over the coming months and quarters? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, so some of that movement and reduction in those fourth quarter 2026 numbers are associated with the sale
of the mortgage warehouse and the mortgage servicing in the MSRs. So, that pushed it out because if you think
about it, as those are going away and we're adding C&I, it's kind of like as one is going down, the other is going
up and they'll crossover sometime in early 2026.
So, that's why we pushed it out two quarters. It's really affiliated that we reduce those two. As I commented, we
do think there is an additional $2 billion to $5 billion of non-core activities that we'll be evaluating, that we would
look to execute on between now and the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
But Ebrahim, to put some numbers to it, the mortgage servicing business out into 2026 timeframe, that was about
$75 million worth of fee income and about $410 million of expense. And that's what we've removed from the
forecast out in that period. And then over 2026 and 2027, redeployed the associated capital into lending.
The warehouse business, we removed that $6 billion worth of loans and then our expectation is that we would
essentially swap that for C&I loans beginning in 2025 and building out through late 2026 and into 2027.

You're welcome.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, just want to follow-up on the credit front. So, the ACL, if you could put
some numbers as to – we see your provision guide, but where do you see the ACL ending up following the review
of this $11 billion remaining?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, the $11 billion that's left, I mean, you start to get into allotted loan count and some smaller loans. And
so I wouldn't say that we're going to finish up $11 billion. We'll get into what I would say is a more normal cycle of
continuing updates around the analysis of the credit portfolio.
But I think we'll see increased charge-offs. I think we'll see continued charge-offs, though, at a lower level in the
third and the fourth quarter, which will likely decrease overall our ACL coverage or ACL reserve percentage just
as we take reserve dollars and that turn into charge-off dollars. I hate to predict exactly the timing of the other
charge-offs and resulting impact on the allowance. Provision expense we feel like is in that $900 million to $1
billion range for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And Casey, one thing I think it's important is like now that we're through 75% of the portfolio and 80% of the multi-
family and all, there isn't like a big wing of loans left that we haven't been through. So, when we kind of look
forward, you really conclude we should be through 95% of the portfolio by the end of this quarter and it would take
further deterioration in the underlying assets of the loans to see further deterioration because in most instances,
just remind you, we've looked forward 18 months. We've taken the account, any significant rate changes which
they're fairly material. When you go from 3.5% to 7.5%, that 4% makes a big difference against the NOI. That
immediately causes you to look at perhaps your future debt service coverage would be at or below 1% that then
causes us to get an appraisal.
So, as Craig said, really over 70% of our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform and pay [ph] as
agree (00:42:29), that we're recognizing the future risk associated with those interest payments. But the other
point I would make is this isn't – should not go on unless there's deterioration in the underlying assets because
we'll be out through – almost all of the portfolio by the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, and particularly with respect to the non-accruals, anything that's a non-accrual has already gone through
getting the appraisal, been charged down to the appraisal value minus the selling cost factor. So, the non-
accruals reflect a pretty focused perspective around the current condition, the current value of the collateral. Not
13


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
to say that the market conditions couldn't worsen and have further degradation of the collateral, but that would be
the only case that we would see a need for significant increase in reserves on the non-accruals.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And just one more on the expense front. The forecast indicates a decent amount of about $0.5
billion of expense leverage. I know you guys have some consolidations, but can you just give us some color as to
how that how that progresses? And what are the key drivers and where you exit the year? Looks like about $425
million, if I looked at 2026. So, just some color there on what's a decent amount of expense leverage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, actually, if you think about it all the way through the forecast period that we presented, so we have about
a $750 million reduction expense. I mentioned about $400 million of that is result of the mortgage business exit,
very, very high efficiency ratio business. So, that overall, that exit will reduce our overall efficiency ratio
expectations. That leaves about $300 million, $350 million of cost reductions on $1 billion, call it, $1.09 billion or
so. So, 15% to 20% cost reduction expectation over the next 18 months or so [indiscernible] (00:44:28) we would
expect being transacted or being executed by the end of the year so that we go into 2025 on a much leaner basis
with a lower cost infrastructure.
I do expect that we'll see a bit of continuing cost reductions in 2025 and then particularly as we get out into 2026,
the expectation that we'll be able to lower some of our regulatory activities and regulatory costs into 2026 and into
2027, and that's what's driving that subsequent reduction of expenses out into the late period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Casey, the one thing that I would add to Craig's comments was in addition to those cost takeouts, there also is
cost build both in kind of our risk framework of the organization. In addition to that, our C&I growth and so that is
kind of a net number. So, there is some moving elements to that number.
But I would also say, Craig and I came from U.S. Bank, highly disciplined on cost structures, very focused on the
efficiency ratio, looking how we have done things. This is still three organizations that haven't really totally
consolidated. They've combined but not consolidated. We're going to be highly focused not only on the cost
structure, but the way we do things in processes within the organization.
And I would just say this is a strong discipline of ours, that we are focused on each business unit or shared
services. Part of the organization knows the number that we expect them to get to. We've been working on this.
We have, every other week, meetings on the cost takeout. So, as we've talked about, we really believe that we
will hit the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year and be able to enter into 2025 at the levels that we need to
be.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Good morning and thanks for all the detail. Joseph, I was wondering, as you understand it, if Mr. Mnuchin decided
to return to the Treasury or another agency within a new administration, would he be required to sell his holdings
in New York Community?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think that's a question better reflected for – directly to Mr. Mnuchin. I don't know all the intricacies of his
agreement or portfolios. Steven did publicly comment on that, that he indicated he did not have to do that, but I
think I would leave that up to Steven and Liberty to be able to make that comment.
I would say Steven has been a remarkable lead director in the company. We value his activities and input. I
couldn't ask for a better partner, so to speak, to help us kind of navigate all the activities. And he answered the
bell last time when he was asked to come to Washington, DC and I can appreciate that comes with great
sacrifices because I joined that train also to go to Washington, DC. And quite frankly, he was, in my opinion, one
of the best Treasury Secretaries that we've ever had in the history of our nation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just one follow-up. Could you share with us the number of private client teams that you have
today? I think it was 100 last quarter and I know you had a lot of senior hires recently, but have you hired many
commercial lenders or relationship people to help drive sort of the business mix change? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, I'll speak to the private client. So, the attrition of the private client banker group, we've had a couple of
teams and bankers here and there, but the bulk of the departure of those bankers was in the late – right at the
end of the first quarter, early second quarter. And it's been quite stable since then and remarkably so has the
deposit base. We've lost less than 10% of the deposits previously associated with those bankers and are now
seeing deposit growth on that front.
So, overall, private client has been really, really solid. That team, with the hiring of Rich Raffetto, has had a place
to rally around and I think has a strong view forward. Joseph can weigh in obviously from a people perspective,
but Rich has already made a couple of key hires and has several more on the way. So, we're definitely gaining
traction in terms of bringing in talent in the C&I space led by Rich's strong leadership and industry reputation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I would just add we did add Adam Feit. Adam was a longtime, highly recognized banker and worked for
Union, MUFG, out on the West Coast. He is going to head up our specialized industries and capital markets
group.
Rita Dailey also is joining our company. She's a longtime banker. I worked with Rita many years ago at Union
Bank. She's coming in to run our deposit-focused industries and our Treasury management. And then we're very
close to hiring somebody in the Northeast here who would run our national commercial banking operation.
And so, in addition to like really, really strong leadership, we began to fill in. If you recall, we do have a number of
existing C&I businesses that operate in the company today and we began to like add people into those
15

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
businesses together so we can – already those engines are kind of up and running. Those include things like
Flagstar Financial, some of the specialized industries and in some of those businesses, we began also to add
talent in those to grow those verticals as well.
So, I would think when we meet 90 days from now, we should have a pretty long list of people that have joined us.
Just remind you, I'd spent virtually my entire career on commercial banking and building franchises both at U.S.
Bank. And then when I went to OneWest Bank, we started from scratch in a very quick order, accumulated some
really talented people into the organization and grew that business to be roughly a third of the business in a short
period of time and substantially increased the franchise value at OneWest Bank before the sale to CIT.

Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. This quarter, were there any CRE loans that were sold or is most of it coming through – is
most of the reduction coming through paydowns? And if there were no sales this quarter, is there any potential to
do sales as rates come down? Are you seeing a bid for any parts of that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. First of all, we did not really conduct any significant sales during the quarter. It is our intention between now
and the end of the year that we would look to reduce the non-accrual loans through sales. We've been looking at
and studying a couple pools. We also have some large individual loans.
We're really excited that we added Bill Fitzgerald, who has come in and joined our company to head up the
Workout group. He's highly experienced in this space and we're meeting weekly now, really going over how do we
reduce those non-accruals through sales to the portfolio. We feel these are marked appropriately and while you
never quite know exactly where the market will be, we do think we have a real opportunity to move a number of
these assets off the balance sheet between now and the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, but there's no willingness to sell maybe parts of the performing loan portfolio, maybe shrink the asset size
below $100 billion?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I mean, I think we would look at everything. As we kind of look out, this quarter alone, we really have between
maturities and price resets roughly $1.65 billion that's in the CRE portfolio. And so when you look at that, I mean,
we're estimating roughly 40% of that portfolio should pay off this quarter. We've been either notified by the
borrowers so they give us indication.
So, we are seeing, just in that alone, that's $500 million or $600 million that will go away through payoffs. But for
the most part, what we're really going to be focused on is how do we reduce those substandard and non-accrual
loans between now and the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And maybe a more medium or longer term question. As I look at the forecast update on slide 9, you do
have the net interest margins rising pretty significantly 2026, relatively flat over 2024 and 2025. Can you speak to
what drives that uptick? Is it just leaning into C&I? Is it maturities on the CRE side? If you could just speak to that.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say about three-fourths of the margin lift is coming from repricing of the loans. Again, $5 billion in the – and just
take multi-family, which is three-fourths of the book. That reprices $5 billion a year in the next two years, $7 billion
to $8 billion out in 2027.
So, as you think about the impact of those repricing up from 3%, 3.5% rates to 7.5%, 8% rates, that has a pretty
significant lift on margin.
The other is redeployment into new lending at not higher spreads, actually similar to lower spreads in the C&I
space, but at more current market rates rather than the existing term carry rates.

Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, just on the non-strategic asset sales, you identified additional $2 billion to $5
billion. Just questions. Was that after reviewing all of the loan portfolios? How do you balance the non-
relationship, non-strategic assets with the ability to exit the asset at par, close to par. And are these potential
sales excluded in this current forecast?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, first of all, the future sales are not the $2 billion to $5 billion. However, just for a point of clarification,
the two sales, both the mortgage warehouse and the mortgage servicing and MSR business, is out of the
forecast. So, that would be considered [ph] NAV (00:55:30) at this point.
The whole common denominator that we've been looking at in the company, what is core, non-core is where we
have a relationship with the borrower and we have full relationships with the company, meaning we have
depository and other activities with the organization. So, as we look at those businesses where there's limited
interactions with the customer or potential with the customer, then those are being viewed as non-core and/or
where the relationship is predominantly a lending relationship and does not offer up any other opportunities to
grow it or enhance our overall yield by cross-selling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Think about it this way. There's probably $10 billion to $15 billion of loans in our books that we could pretty easily
exit – pretty easily and quickly exit at par if we needed to, just from a pure capital perspective. And so that has a
bit of a backstop in terms of capital buffer opportunity, but it would have an impact from an earnings perspective.
And more importantly, as Joseph mentioned, some of those are in businesses that our client base and we want to
retain.
So, as we work through that and take out from that, the businesses that are strategic, the businesses that are
more important to us from a growth perspective, that's where you get back to that $2 billion to $3 billion potential
that we might look at over the next couple quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Okay, great. And then just a follow-up, Craig, on the borrower's updated financial statements. I think you
mentioned you received 80% of the portfolio. And I believe the NOIs were – it seemed higher than expected year-
over-year, just anything you've gotten from that data because, obviously, the provisioning, the credit outlook has
changed dramatically. And it's interesting that at least from the NOI comment, it's better. But was there anything
else in those financials that either kind of confirmed that the borrower's financial situations have improved or
[indiscernible] (00:57:33) anything you can comment on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Salvatore J. DiMartino A
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. I think what I said was confirmed is that inflation was pretty impactful to particularly the regulated portfolio.
And while it's fairly stabilized at this point, it's certainly at a much lower level of return for those borrowers. But
from a lender perspective to a point where it seems to have come in at a level that a lot of the loans will be able to
get through or with a little bit of borrower support will be able to get through. And there will be some that that will
fail. And that's why we're focused really hard at identifying that, measuring that and classifying that. But again,
about two-thirds of the NOIs came in higher than the previous year, about one-third lower. It's the ones that are
lower that you worry about. And that's why it's good that we're through a significant portion of the portfolio. We
really focused on going out to the borrowers, ensuring we got the financials pointing out to them some of the
repercussions to them if they didn't provide them and making sure that we got as much current information as we
could pretty quickly as we got into this portfolio.

Hi, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Maybe just shifting to the other side of the balance sheet, looking at the deposit
growth, what's the incremental cost of deposit growth right now? And when you look at like the DDAs, are you are
you paying up through ECR to get those? And, I guess, the corollary is what's the value proposition for a
customer incrementally coming onto the bank right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So in the private client and commercial space, we're not really paying up from an ECR perspective. In the
retail space, we are about – half of that growth was in our savings product and about half was in the CD product.
And we're certainly priced attractively in the market from a customer perspective. So we're paying close attention
on the opportunities as rates are receding a bit here and bringing down rates appropriately there. From a private
client space, the vast majority of that growth actually was not premium priced. It was actually pretty typical for that
business which is a very transaction-based deposit set. I think the average pricing on the deposits raised in the
private client space was right along the lines of 2.75%, 3%. Only about $200 million or about $150 million of it was
in the more premium-priced product. So from a business proposition perspective, obviously, it's our ability to serve
the customers, certainly, in the private client space, the high-touch relationship aspect. And then for the retail
customers, it's the expectation that as we move the customers into the savings products, it gives us the
opportunity to make broader connections and make them more sticky by expanding our product set through the
branch network.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, again, it wasn't necessarily the look forward. It was the receipt of – in large part the receipt of appraisals on
the assets then moves them. Once we identify that the secondary source may have a shortfall, then they move
into non-accrual and we take an associated charge off with it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
But it is – I think we don't have that number necessarily like right in front of us, but we can see if we can get that
for you. And because that – instead of looking at like today's loan through the review, we also look forward to say
what would the pricing impact be 18 months out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, the result of looking – with the current updated borrower financial information in terms of looking out is
an increase that we saw in substandards in the first quarter that then flowed through in terms of charge offs, we
do have an increase in substandards in the second quarter as well as a result of getting the updated borrower
financial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So if you think about it, a borrower submits the data and at the current rate of 3.4%, we would look at that current
cash flow and say, hey, there's sufficient debt service coverage here. But then when you look forward 18 months
and if that gets caught in that net, so to speak, of either repricing or maturity, then we also underwrite that loan at
the current market interest rates. And so if you're looking at current NOI against a 400 basis point increase in your
interest rate, that's what can push that into the non-accrual or the substandard category.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So the numbers are in the appendix of the earnings release. But think of it this way, the updated borrower
financial information is driving the increase in substandards. The appraisal confirmation of value is what's driving
the increase in non-accruals.

Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe we could start going back to the loans that reset this past quarter. You guys mentioned
there's 8.19% rate. Just curious, what is the debt service coverage for that type of borrower these days?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Starts getting pretty thin. I mean, the reality is you've had – particularly in the rent rate regulated space, you get
3% rent increases, you get inflation for a couple of years running at 4% or 5%, and then you double the debt
service and where we had 50% to 60% debt service coverage ratios or maybe I should say 200% debt service
coverage ratios at underwriting. Now, you start getting down pretty low. So I don't know the statistics on that exact
bucket but there are certainly ones that are resetting particularly in the rent-regulated space are getting in that –
there's a lot of them in that [ph] 1% to 1.1% (01:04:39) multiple range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And in terms of the loans that were placed on substandard or non-performing status this quarter, and I'm
just curious, are the vast majority of those interest-only loans? Are they rent-controlled? Just kind of curious on
some of the underlying characteristics.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
The reprice really reflects the whole balance – reflects the general characteristics of the overall portfolio. So it's
not – there are interest only ones. There certainly are rent-regulated ones, but it's not in any particular pocket.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just to clarify, you have an 18-month look forward. Is that kind of a cutoff for what loans are being
classified as substandard or criticized these days? And for those maturities that are further out in 2026 and 2027,
it's a long – we'll see those build if rates stay at current levels. Is that kind of how to think about the pipeline?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's exactly the way to think about it. I think if rates stay higher for longer than what the current projects right
now, then that be a worsening of credit conditions that would have an impact on us in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And one more if I can sneak on the appraisals that you're getting here, what is the cap rate you're seeing?
What's the cap rate that you're using or receiving on appraisals?
[indiscernible] (01:06:09)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's a great question. It varies quite broadly between asset classes and the geography. I mean, even
[indiscernible] (01:06:17) have very different cap rates based upon the different product type, but anywhere from
6% to 9% cap rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. Appreciate all that. I guess just maybe one last thing in terms of – on the CRE side, you guys
disclosed that there's [ph] three-year IOs (01:06:39) in that portfolio. Curious how much of the commercial real
estate is IO and what's the full principal and interest debt service charge ratio for that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I don't have the statistics for full, but I would tell you that that when we credit risk rate and we get the borrower
financials, we do it on a on a principal and interest fully amortizing basis. We're looking at the ability of those loans
to cover. We don't just look at interest only on a current basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. I'll step back in the queue here. Thank you very much.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We focus principally on the portfolios that don't carry much spread, aren't high-margin. So I wouldn't expect it
would have a significant negative impact on ROE.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. So, less than the sales that you had in this quarter. Okay. And then with the servicing sale, are there
deposits that will go with that or can you quantify?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
There are. So the servicing deposits move up and down pretty [ph] volatily (01:07:58) but at the end of the month,
they're slightly above call it their low point, typically at the end of the month. So about $3.7 billion of deposits in
the servicing business. Now, we'll get $1.03 billion back from the cash – on the sale transaction. So net-net
impact on liquidity is just a little bit over $2.5 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And those are very high-cost deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. There's two sets of those deposits. There's the deposits on our owned servicing, they're fairly low cost.
That's about $1 billion. But then the other $2.5 billion, $3 billion is fairly high-cost deposits on the subservicing
business. So I'm not sad to see those go. It basically worked out kind of neutral to us from a funding cost
perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And are probably the highest cost of all those debt portfolios.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I was hoping you could just talk little bit about the overall balance sheet size rest of this year to 2025. I think the
guidance suggests that earning assets stay between, call it, $109 billion. But I'm curious just how you're weighing
the decision around saying over $100 billon or going below. And then with that, if you do decide to stay over $100
billion, when do you become subject to the Category IV bank stress test, is that 2025 event or 2026 event?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So the current projections are that we wouldn't come below $100 billion in total assets. We absolutely will have a
decrease. So we were at earning assets of $110 billion, $111 billion at the end of June. We'd see that drift down
to the end of the year around $104 billion principally related to the mortgage warehouse loans being sold here in
the third quarter. As you think about moving forward in $100 billion, we do have a much higher level of on balance
sheet liquidity that we have to hold as a Category IV bank. Officially, we became a Category IV bank on October 1
of 2023. With respect to the stress test, Cat IV banks are up every other year [ph] on even year (01:10:15). So our
expectation is that we wouldn't be in the in the CCAR stress test cycle until 2026 submission. We do run our own
company, run stress tests and, in fact, submitted to the Federal Reserve our company-run stress test here in
2024, and we'll do so again in 2025 but we don't expect to be held to the Federal Reserve-run stress test until
2026.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then could you just help me out with the NIM outlook for the next couple of quarters? And I would
really appreciate if you could provide what accretable yield was for this quarter expectations through the end of
the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So accretable yield is tapering down. I think, let's just say it adds probably 7 basis points or 8 basis points
to the margin and it tapers down through – into the middle of next year. The expectation around margin is that we
will see a continued reduction principally as a result of the warehouse sale coming off of the balance sheet over
the next couple of quarters. But given the full year margin here, hate to give exact predictions on the quarters. But
we'll see it via at this level to slightly down over the next two quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then I know you'd mentioned some cash levels, liquidity levels are high. You're going to use it to pay down
some wholesale. Could you just give us some frame or reference of where you think the cash to assets ratio will
sit by the end of the year? And is that a good level where you want to be in 2025?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Well, I think the deposit growth that we had in the second quarter is strong. It gives us the capacity to – gave us
the capacity to let those high-cost deposits with the mortgage business go. And if you think about the cash that
we get from the warehouse sale, I think you'll see that that will be sort of in the level that we'll redeploy into paying
down debt is around the level of what we get from the warehouse. And I think that puts us at an appropriate
position. As we look forward, we'll have deposit growth that will allow us to continue to repay debt and we'll have
loan paydowns that will then be redeploying into new lending categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then when all is said and done with the preferred conversions – let me back up. I appreciate you providing
the common shares outstanding with the reverse share split. What is the impact from the warrants on the diluted
that we should expect going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, so it really depends on what you expect in terms of the share price. They'll be net [ph] sellable (01:13:05).
And so it's public information how many warrants are out there. But current share price is not particularly
impactful. More share price – at a higher share price then that net settlement could lead to a much higher level of
shares. But it's hard to predict exactly what the share price would be and when those holders would choose to
convert or when they choose to net exercise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Last quick one from me. Just some understanding as to why loan administration income went negative this
quarter and is that negative $5 million a decent run rate here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
From a loan administration perspective, I guess I would say that it relates to a number of factors. The servicing
business, some of the trickle-on stuff that we had associated with the FDIC and servicing their loans, I would
expect after the servicing sale, our loan and administration income would be essentially zero.

Good morning.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Craig, on slide 9, the provision expectations, obviously, increased. And, I don't know, maybe it's unfair to ask
for an accurate outlook last quarter, but what kind of confidence level do you have in the provision outlook that
you're providing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say that higher confidence level than we had last quarter. I mean, the management team not only were new
but not all of them were here. We have a new chief credit officer. He's here. He's been in the house for about a
month and is really dug in. And then – again, we had – our updated borrower financial information level was about
20% at the end of the first quarter and it's 80% now. So we have a lot more visibility and that drives a lot of the
measurements. Really what's left is some appraisal gathering, but we've generally provisioned where we would
expect that would come in. But from a loan classification standpoint, there will be some additional [ph] trickle-on
(01:15:12) impact. Most of that came in in the second quarter. I won't give you a confidence level, but I would say
it's we have a much higher confidence level now than we did at the end of the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. That's fair. On NPA expectations, I think you're signaling we should expect another increase in Q3.
Is that fair? Is it going to be a step function or how can you prepare us for what we should see in NPAs in the third
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It won't be as significant as it was in the second quarter. I think we'll see some increase. But I think as
Joseph mentioned, we'll be working to taper that back with transactions where we dispose off some of that NPA
bucket. Will that exactly net out? Probably not in the third quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, our
expectation is we'd be able to keep that flat to down as we get into the fourth quarter and into early next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. last one, Joseph, for you. I'D call it a financial psychology question, but where do you feel the most
rushed or under pressure in terms of your day-to-day tasks? I'm curious if you feel like is it triage mode or is that
unfair and is this all kind of methodical at this point for you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think, we've spent a lot of time over the last 90 days really understanding the company and digging into the
attributes. I think when we met last time, we said there were really kind of three buckets that we were really
focused on. One was getting our earnings accurate and forecasting and communicating those and understanding
the consequences of activities. The second was really making sure we understood the loan book and that we
26

understand the risk and we could communicate that risk with a degree of confidence. And the third was building
out our risk infrastructure within the company. This organization grew very quickly. Both the talent and
infrastructure of the risk organization was not in place. If you look on that page 5 where we've added talent, you
can see a lot of the talent that we've added have OCC experience and are here to help us build that infrastructure.
So if we decide to stay above $100 billion that we have the right risk infrastructure for Category IV bank.
But the third big bucket being that we really – including my background, being comptroller of the currency, we
view that a very important part of an organization that we have the right risk infrastructure. So I'd say in those
three buckets, we feel like we've made incredible progress. And then I would also say, we recognize the desire to
have a very strong liquidity and capital in the bank. As we're making these movements to become more simpler,
we also want to have a very fortress liquidity and equity of the company.

Okay. Thank you very much, operator. Very much appreciate everybody joining. I would say there's a lot of really
good energy around the company and the direction we're heading. We now have, I think, a very experienced
executive and leadership team to execute the business plan. We will have a simpler organization when we've
concluded the asset sales and move the company forward. We will maintain liquidity and capital which we think
are more than necessary to run this organization and that, at the same time, we're really much focused on
growing the bank and the sectors that we've communicated, specifically, in the private bank, the retail bank, small
business and the C&I segments of our company. Too often people can get [ph] dragged (01:19:15) into the
problems and not be thinking about the solution. And I just want to assure the investment community and our
investors that we're also focused on what this company will look like in the future.
