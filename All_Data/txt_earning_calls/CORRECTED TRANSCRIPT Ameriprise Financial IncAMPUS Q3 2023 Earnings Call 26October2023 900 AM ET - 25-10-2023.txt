Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with
me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you see a discussion
of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial
measures which we believe provides insight into the company's operations.
Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on
our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's
expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking
statements can be found in our third quarter 2023 earnings release, our 2022 Annual Report to shareholders and
our 2022 10-K.
We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On slide 3, you see our
GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter.
Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which
management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of
our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the
third quarter. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating
results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Yesterday afternoon, Ameriprise reported strong third quarter
earnings. The business continues to perform very well in a fluid and uncertain operating environment. Across the
firm, we're helping clients navigate external pressures with our high-quality advice solutions and service.
As you can see in our results, Ameriprise continues to benefit from the complementary strength and flexibility of
our business and our talented team. Regarding the economic landscape, while inflation has come down a bit, it
remains elevated, so it's likely we'll see higher interest rates for longer.
Economic growth in the United States continues to hold up well even with increased rates. However, consumer
sentiment in the United States is declining, and we may see softer economic growth in the future. Additionally, the
geopolitical climate is causing further volatility.
Equity markets have been resilient and were up year-over-year, but down slightly in the quarter. At the same time,
many investors are holding greater levels of cash and feel comfortable earning competitive yields in cash
products. Our assets under management and administration reached $1.2 trillion, up 12% and financials were
also strong.
We delivered record operating results in the quarter. Excluding unlocking and a regulatory accrual, total adjusted
operating net revenue grew nicely, up 10% to $3.9 billion, and earnings were also quite strong, up 18% with EPS
up considerably, an increase of 24%.
Additionally, our return on equity was 49.9% compared to 48% a year ago. Very few firms in our industry achieve
nearly a 50% ROE on an ongoing basis. Our complementary businesses consistently generate strong financial
results. Let's start with Wealth Management.
Our advice value proposition is built for the current environment. Advisers are focused on ensuring clients are
highly engaged and deepening relationships with them. Importantly, client satisfaction remains at an excellent 4.9
out of 5 stars.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Total client assets increased 15% to $816 billion with good client net flows of $8.9 billion and market appreciation.
We continue to attract more new clients and move up market as we grow our client base. And we know from
industry research that more investors need guidance.
In fact, among affluent households, many investors in the marketplace still don't have a formal plan to manage
assets, income and expenses and retirement. As we highlighted previously, our advisers continue to hold a higher
level of cash for their clients with the highest short-term yields they're able to attain and the market uncertainty.
Therefore, we continue to see a lower percentage of our assets moving into wrap, with $5.4 billion in the quarter.
As markets settle, we expect that money will ultimately be redeployed into wrap and other solutions. Our re-entry
back into the banking business came at the right time and is very beneficial for the firm.
Assets in the bank and certificate company continued to increase substantially up 37% to $35 billion. With interest
rates at this level, we're able to go on meaningful spread revenues that are sustainable when the Fed does start
to cut rates.
We will also be launching new products in the bank that will bring over additional client cash that they're holding at
other banking institutions. And overall, after a bit of a slowdown last year, we saw a nice increase in transactional
activity up 11%. As you know, we continue to invest to put great capabilities in advisors' hands to drive high
satisfaction and growth and deliver an exceptional experience.
We're using advanced analytics to deliver an even better client and advisor experience. This includes a complete
practice dashboard to enhance practice management. prepare for client meetings more efficiently, identify
opportunities to grow their business and deepen their client relationships.
In the quarter, we were back in the market with our successful Ameriprise brand advertising across TV, digital and
social channels. We also redesigned our client website to even be more engaging, highlighting the unique
benefits of working with an Ameriprise advisor.
Advisor productivity increased another 10% to a new high of $901,000 per advisor in the quarter. Our advisor
retention and growth are both consistently among the best in the industry.
Regarding recruiting, we brought in another 64 experienced productive advisors. We had a bit of a seasonal
slowdown of activity to begin the quarter but saw a nice pickup in September, and we believe that we'll return to
more normal levels as we move through the rest of the year.
Our reputation is an important differentiator. We recently learned that Ameriprise is being recognized for both a
high level of customer trust and
service. We received one of the highest Customer Trust Index scores among financial services firms in Forrester's
2023 US Customer Trust Index.
And for the fifth consecutive year, J.D. Power has recognized Ameriprise for providing outstanding customer
service experience for phone support for advisors. These awards build on the external recognition we have
received over the years and are a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team.
Finally, in terms of profitability, Wealth Management continues to generate strong pre-tax adjusted operating
margin at more than 30%, and earnings growth of 23%.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Now let's move to Retirement & Protection, which is part of our Wealth Management Solutions offering. We're
driving good sales in targeted focused areas that serve our clients' comprehensive needs and generate good risk-
adjusted returns. In our life business, we focused on variable universal life and disability products that are
appropriate for this environment.
Life and health sales were up nicely, increasing 22%, with the majority of sales in higher-margin accumulation
VUL products. We're also seeing positive initial results from our accelerated underwriting modeling that's highly
automated and will drive further efficiencies as we roll it out more fully.
In variable annuities, our structured product continues to attract good interest, combined with our variable
annuities without living benefits, sales are up 18% from a year ago.
In the quarter, our RiverSource Retirement interactive tool, which helps advisors create customized client
presentations was recognized with several industry awards for innovation and ease of use. With the increase in
rates, we're able to garner improved yield in our high-quality investment portfolio. Excluding unlocking, pre-tax
adjusted operating earnings were more than $200 million. Our RPS business has been highlighted as one of the
most profitable in the industry.
Let's turn to Asset Management. As you saw in the quarter, assets under management were $587 million, up 7%.
It remains a challenging time, both in asset management and the active space in particular.
Our flows were largely consistent with the industry. In retail, as we know, people are still hesitant to put money to
work, so gross sales were a bit weaker. However, redemptions have improved and our overall flow rates in the
US are in line with active managers for the product disciplines we compete in.
And in Europe, our flows have improved a bit from a year ago. Institutional mandates can be lumpy, but [ph] we
were in (00:10:43) net flows, excluding legacy insurance partners. We're earning mandates in a number of areas,
though LDI flows in total were down compared to a robust quarter a year ago.
In regard to our investment performance, we have strong short and long-term performance across equities, fixed
income and asset allocation with a nice pickup in the short-term fixed income. And now about 70% of our asset-
weighted funds were above the median for three and five-year periods and more than 85% for the 10-year period.
This is a positive and will help our ability to garner flows in the future. Also in the quarter, we completed one of the
largest aspects of the EMEA integration, the transition to our global order management system. With that, we
have now completed all of the large integration activities.
We are now focused on adjusting our global operating model and expenses so we can continue to generate good
margins in a tough climate. For Asset Management, adjusted operating margin was 36% and above our targeted
range. G&A was down 3% adjusted for foreign exchange.
We also have taken action to tightly manage expenses, and we're looking more fully across the business to
continue to reduce expenses and leverage more operating efficiencies for the rest of this year and into 2024.
I'd like to now come back to center stage in the total firm. Our complementary businesses continue to give us the
ability to deliver for our clients and generate very strong financial results over the years. Our capital strength and
flexibility remain excellent.

Our capital return to shareholders is among the highest in the industry, and we have consistently generated
strong financial returns over the years, including with our best-in-class ROE of approximately 50%.
Ameriprise is situated very well, including with the complementary addition of the bank, which allows us to sustain
the benefit from higher rates. We're not standing still. We're focused on areas of opportunity for growth, and at the
same time, we're examining the entire expense base across the firm to further prepare if the economic
environment slows as we move into and through 2024.
In closing, it's the totality of our complementary business and the benefits that it provides, backed by our excellent
team that enables us to consistently achieve this level of results.
Now Walter will elaborate on our financials. Walter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you. As Jim said, strong results this quarter continued to demonstrate the leverage of our diversified
business model, with adjusted EPS, excluding unlocking and regulatory accrual up 24% to $7.87.
Growth in fee-based and spread-based revenues, coupled with disciplined expense management drove excellent
financial results, which is a continuation of our strong and sustainable trend across this market cycle. Assets
under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, up 12%, AUMA benefited from strong
client flows and market appreciation. Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the
revenue opportunity within each segment.
While we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives, particularly in Wealth
Management, we are taking a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses to manage margins across our
businesses given the uncertainty in the macro environment.
G&A expenses were well managed in the quarter, up 4%. Excluding the regulatory accrual, general and
administrative expense grew 2% from higher business volumes and growth investments. Our G&A expenses
remain on track with our expectations for the year.
Our consolidated margin reached a record high of 27.5%, excluding unlocking and regulatory accruals. Balance
sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our portfolio is well positioned, and we have strong capital and liquidity
positions.
This allowed us to return $663 million of capital to shareholders, a strong return of 81% of our operating earnings
excluding unlocking. And a continuation of our differentiated track record.
Turning to slide 6. Revenue growth was strong at 10% from higher interest earnings and the cumulative benefit of
client net inflows. With average equity markets up 11%. Excluding unlocking and the regulatory accrual, pre-tax
operating earnings increased 20% from last year with meaningful benefits from strong client flows, higher interest
earnings and well-managed expenses.
Let's turn to individual segment performance beginning with Wealth Management on slide 7. Wealth Management
client assets increased 15% to $816 billion driven by strong organic growth and client flows, along with higher
equity markets.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
We've had $43 billion of net inflows over the past year, with $9 billion coming in this quarter from new clients
joining the firm, the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisors. Clients remain
defensively positioned with a lower level of flows into wrap than we have seen historically.
Our flexible model and broad offerings allow advisors and clients to pivot as markets and client preferences shift,
while the money stays within the system. Revenue per advisor reached $901,000 in the quarter, up 10% from the
prior year from a higher spread revenue, enhanced productivity and business growth.
Turning to slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on client cash levels. Our total cash balances reached a new high
this quarter at $72.5 billion as we continue to see new money flowing into money market funds and brokered CDs
as well as into certificates. This creates a significant redeployment opportunity as markets normalize for clients to
put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform.
Cash sweep is largely working cash for our client accounts. While there is some seasonality with cash levels,
cash remains an important component of the clients' asset allocation. Cash sweep and certificate balance ended
the third quarter at $40.5 billion, down $5.8 billion from a year ago and down $1.5 billion sequentially.
Since the end of August, cash levels have been essentially flat. Our sweep cash has an average size of $6,000
per account and 67% of the aggregate cash is now in accounts under $100,000, and we have seen very limited
movement out of these accounts. The financial benefit from cash remains strong. This will be an important and
sustainable source of earnings going forward. We continue to manage our investment portfolios prudently.
Our bank portfolio is AAA rated with a 3.6-year duration. The overall yield on the investments in the portfolio is
4.7% and rising with new money yield on investments in the second quarter of 6.5%. Our certificate portfolio is
highly liquid with over half of the portfolio in cash, governments and agencies. It is AA rated on average with a
one-year duration. In total, the certificate company portfolio is now yielding 5.6%, with new purchases in the
quarter at 6%.
On slide 9, we delivered extremely strong financial results in Wealth Management. Profitability, excluding the
regulatory accrual increased 26% in the quarter with strong organic growth, the benefit of higher interest rates and
continued client net inflows. The pre-tax operating margin was very strong at 31.1%, excluding the regulatory
accrual.
Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% with distribution expenses up 9%, reflecting higher asset balances.
Excluding the regulatory accrual, G&A grew only 2%, which was in line with expectations, reflecting investments
for growth and higher volume-related activity. We continue to expect AWM full year 2023 G&A growth to be in the
mid-single-digit range.
We remain on track to close the Comerica Investment Program Partnership in November, which will bring
approximately 100 advisors and $18 billion of client assets.
Let's turn to Asset Management on slide 10. Financial results were very strong in the quarter, and we are
managing the business well through a challenging environment that is impacting the industry. Total AUM
increased 7% to $587 billion, primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation, partially
offset by net outflows. Asset management, like other active managers, was an outflows in the quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Like others, we experienced pressure from global market volatility and a risk-off investor sentiment. Investment
performance has been another critical area of focus, and we are seeing improvement, including in fixed income
strategies. Overall, long-term performance remains very strong, and we had improvement in one-year fixed
income numbers.
On slide 11, in the quarter, asset management earnings increased to $199 million as a result of equity market
appreciation, disciplined expense management, higher performance fees and $7 million of favorable timing-
related items, which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows. The margin was 36% in the quarter.
Importantly, we continue to manage the areas we can control.
Expenses remain well managed. Total expenses declined 1% with G&A decreasing $1 million. However,
excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation, G&A was down 3%, reflecting early benefits from
expense management initiatives. As Jim said, given the environment, we are taking a very focused look across
the business globally to further reduce expense.
Let's turn to slide 12. Retirement & Protection Solutions contained to deliver good earnings and free cash flow
generation, reflecting the high quality of the business.
In the quarter, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings, excluding unlocking, were $204 million, up 4% from the prior
year, primarily as a result of the higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed last year.
We continue to view normalized annual earnings of $800 million as a reasonable expectation for this business.
We completed our annual actuarial assumption update in the quarter resulting in an unfavorable pre-tax impact of
$104 million, primarily related to updates to persistency assumptions for variable annuities.
Overall, Retirement & Protection Solutions improved in the quarter, with Protection sales of 22% to $79 million,
primarily in higher-margin VUL products. Variable annuity sales grew 18% to $1.1 billion, with the majority of the
sales in structured variable annuities. Our long-term care business continues to perform very well. The business
is gradually running off as clients age. Our claims experience continues to perform very well and remain in line
with our expectations.
Additionally, our success with both rate increases and benefit reduction strategies have exceeded our
expectations. You can see additional detail of this block in the appendix of this presentation.
Now, let's move to the balance sheet on slide 13. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our
diversified high-quality investment portfolio remains well positioned. In total, the average credit rating of the
portfolio is AA with less than 1% of the portfolio in below investment-grade securities. VA hedge effectiveness
remained very strong at 94%.
Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable 90% free cash flow contributions across all
business segments. This supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders. During
the quarter, we returned $663 million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of excess capital
and $1.9 billion of holding company available liquidity.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, good morning. So, wanted to start with a two-part question on organic growth within Wealth. You had another
solid quarter of flows, but the pace did moderate slightly for you and frankly, some of your wealth peers as well.
Just given the challenging operating backdrop, I was hoping first, that you could speak to your confidence level in
sustaining that mid-single-digit flow rate; and then second, with the onboarding of Comerica, any color you can
share on the growth outlook or backlog for new mandates within the bank channel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. I'll start. When we look at the flow rate from a client perspective, we still feel very good about the ability to
bring in client flows and we're approaching the market, particularly as we move a bit more upmarket. As you
would imagine, I mean, there are some blips and not blips depending on where you are in the season.
I think for the summer time things slowed a bit. But we don't see that as sort of a trend line down. We see it as
more of a sustainable based on what we're doing, how advisors are engaged and how they're attracting clients
and activity in the marketplace. So, we still feel very good about our ability to continue on the client flow rate. As
far as the – you want to mention Comerica?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, obviously, we're on target for closure with them in the beginning of November. And yes, we do have a very
active pipeline at this stage. So, yes, we feel that there's opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And just for my follow-up on the Asset Management margins. As you noted, the business is facing
secular headwinds and given some of the pressures, I was pleasantly surprised by the margin strength, the
resiliency that we saw in the quarter.
I was hoping you could just speak to your margin outlook if flow headwinds persist and whether there's additional
expense flexibility to defend those margins and stay within your targeted range of 31% to 35%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, as you saw, first on the fee level, it's been very stable, which is very positive. Again, you're going to always
have some adjustments based upon where the assets and the type of assets, institutional retail. But from an
outlook perspective, we're just beginning our expense tightening there. You saw a reduction in expense around
3% on FX adjusted.

But we feel there's a good opportunity for us as we look at our global operating environment now that we've fully
integrated the BMO acquisition on to our global platforms. And now we're looking at how we tighten those
processes, how we improve the efficiency, the operating effectiveness and where resources are located, etcetera.
So, we're taking a very hard look at that and we're at the beginning stages of that, not the end.

Operator: The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So first, maybe around cash in Advice & Wealth
Management. It sounds like the trends in sorting continue to stabilize over the course of the quarter. So, maybe
just a quick update on where the balances stand relative to the $28 billion that you reported at the end of
September.
And I guess, more importantly, as you think about the mix, I think you have about $4 billion of balance sheet
sweep deposits. Does that leave you much room to move more into the bank or the growth of the bank from this
point on, really should just be a function of reinvestment of securities and picking up some of that incremental
yield that you spoke to earlier?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. I think the question is we ended the quarter at $28 billion on sweep. And as of October, it's $28 billion. And
so it is totally stabilized from that standpoint. Yes, we do have certainly a buffer to move into bank. We are just
being very measured and cautious at this stage as we're evaluating the environment, but we do have certainly a
buffer to move additional [indiscernible] (00:29:11).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. And zooming out a little bit on – given your comments around expenses and you're early in stages of
maybe doing more on the asset management side, but also managing G&A tightly across the firm. Any early
thoughts on 2024 G&A growth firm wide relative to what you're likely to do in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Alex, we're definitely in that review now. What I would say is to start the G&A would be flat at best, meaning in
a sense that is not going up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was looking for an update on the recruiting
front. Financial advisor head count was down in the quarter. Franchise retention was lower. And the 64 new
recruit count was also below the prior run rate. So, I was just wondering if you can give us an update for your
expectation both recruiting and FA head count growth over the next 12 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So, as we mentioned, recruiting was a bit slower in the third quarter, but it started to bounce back towards
the latter part of the quarter. July started a bit slower, I think, vacations and other things, as you probably saw
around the country. But we saw that bounce back in September. The pipeline is quite strong. We think we'll get
back to our consistent rate.
And then you mentioned a little bit of an uptick in attrition. The attrition really in that channel was mainly due to
assistant financial advisors, which is, again, the turnover there is a bit higher. All the franchisees, their retention
rate is still at all-time highs and that book of business stays. So, it's more of some assistance in their practices as
they make some changes. So, we don't see any change in where we were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks, Jim. And then on the client cash balances, I was wondering if you could just share what the ROEs look
like on the certificates business, compared to your core cash balances and products. And just update us on, what
are your plans to grow this base further. I think you have to hold about 5% capital against the asset base and
also, I think there's probably some value in extending CDs to third parties. It helps expand your brand, etcetera.

Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Let me take the first part of the question on certificates. Yes. Certificates as a regulatory item has a 5% capital
element associated with that. But when we evaluate it, we obviously assess it. So, that's the regulatory portion of
it. And so we feel very comfortable with that. And the growth potential there, we have adequate capital and cash
to support that. So, that is the range in which we operate on. And then certainly, it's been growing, and we've
been supporting it. The second part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The second part you mentioned is the opportunity to bring in more external cash if I understood that correctly. And
yes, we're very much focused. As I said, we initially put a savings product. We're looking at more of a preferred
type of thing to bring more cash in from clients outside banking activities.
We're going to be putting in place a full checking account and then some various lending products as well. So, we
will look to establish a more full-fledged banking activity, with the ability to attract more assets externally into the
bank that would also help bring more assets on board in total for the client activities for the advisors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The only thing I would add to that is that obviously, we have more [ph] than enough capital (00:33:32) to support
that sort of growth that Jim was just referring to.

Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go to that slide that talked about the $32 billion of third-party cash. I guess
that piece has grown substantially. And I guess the question is, what do you think needs to happen in order for
that to get deployed?
Because it sounds like you're thinking some of it may go into wrap, but then you're offering these newer bank
products that might move some of that third-party cash to our own products. So, maybe just give us a sense of
how you think that will develop as we move forward here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So Suneet, I think that's really the larger question, right? And that depends on how people feel about the
market and where rates are going forward, right. So, I think if you saw the market over the last number of
quarters, it increased tremendously with a lot of volatility and people were concerned, right. A few stocks drove
that up. Now you see a pullback occurring, right.

So, I think if the market starts to feel like it's on a better, more solid footing, I think people will start to deploy back.
I also think that as rates, if they stabilize on the long-term up where they are rather than continue to rise, you'll see
money move from the short to the long-term to lock it in, right, and get that appreciation and the spread.
So, I don't have a crystal ball. But I think we're holding extra cash for the reason that we feel a little bit regarding
the environment and where the markets are. But that will go back. People don't hold that amount of cash at that
percentage that we're seeing right now.
And I think that's across the industry, not just in our channel. But it's good. It stays with us right now. And when it's
ready to deploy, our advisors will definitely do it. They're investing for the long-term, not just to take advantage of
the market in the short-term.

And can you just provide some timing on when you're planning on rolling out some of those other banking
products that you mentioned in response to an earlier question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. We're looking to do that over the course of the new year. So, we're looking to phase that in. And right now,
we're just looking at the climate and looking at the operating activities for that. So, we feel good about getting
things up and running in the bank in more of a full-fledged fashion. So, it will be periodic. We'll alert you to it as we
go about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Makes sense. And then maybe just if I could sneak one more in on expenses for Walter. So, I think you said flat in
2024 relative to 2023. When you think about the segment level, should we assume a little bit of a decline in Asset
Management offset by some growth in Advice & Wealth Management just in terms of the moving pieces there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, I think that's a reasonable assumption. Obviously, we are focusing on CTI and looking at to preserve margin
and certainly continue to take advantage of the growth opportunities in AWM, but still prudently managing the
expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. And Suneet, I mean, across the firm, we're going to look for that to be managed pretty tightly, okay. So, I
mean, I don't have firm number at this point in time. But as I said, I feel good to start with about G&A flat.

Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Morning. First question, just a follow-up on the $32 billion of third-party client cash. Do you currently earn any fee
on that money at all from an administration perspective or would that all be revenue upside if that gets deployed
into your wrap account?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Its marginal. I would say it's bigger around four or five basis points, but it's the real opportunity of redeployment
that will provide us certainly the margin and profitability potential.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got you. Let's see, the other question I had was on variable annuity reserve charge. I know when some other
companies have taken reserve strengthening under the new accounting that there's been an ongoing earnings
drag in addition to the reserve charge, anything like that to consider for the variable annuity charge, Walter.
I think I heard you say the $200 million a quarter was still intact on guide. So, I presume that means probably not
much, but just curious if there's any impact there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
You're correct. It's probably not much. And the answer is no, really.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, Thanks. And then should there be a similar 4Q charge on a statutory basis for the same assumption
changes or is that still TBD?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I think it's still TBD.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And then if I could sneak in a final one. Long Term Care. I saw your updated disclosures, which I thought was
helpful. I guess considering that this block continues to shrink, it looks like the risk is well managed, is risk transfer
still a consideration here or is the bid/ask spread still too wide or should we really think about you most likely
continuing to own it considering the risk continues to shrink?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, over the years, we certainly have been able to demonstrate that we are managing the risk very effectively. So,
any risk transfer would have to consider that and really have a very balanced bid/ask because the portfolio is
performing quite well. And it's indicated in the observations that you made about it. So yes, we feel very
14

comfortable in retaining it. But if somebody comes along with something that is certainly in the best interest of the
shareholder, we'll consider it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Over the last number of years, it's performed better than we expected in many instances, and improved in that
sense. And we haven't factored in some of the other things that has affected through COVID as a positive yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks.

Operator: The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks for all the color on the cash dynamics here intra-quarter
and quarter-to-date and certainly sounds encouraging. I guess does that mean that we could get back to a period
where we are looking at how to grow the sweep balances and it just becomes a function of net new assets or is
that, sort of, more organic growth trajectory still hindered by balance remixing? And when do you think we could
get to that period? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, obviously, as you can see, it truly has stabilized. And yes, as we bring new years in and that certainly is
growth. And certainly, as we have organic growth, that is an opportunity.
Right now, I can't predict environments and things like that, but we feel very good because of the stability of the
sweep account, as we said, a substantial portion of that's – close to 70%, 67% is in account balances that are
under $100,000. The average [ph] account (00:41:35) being $6,000, I think. So, it's very stable. It's working capital
and working cash that's deployed. So yes, certainly as we grow, we anticipate that growing. But again, there's a
lot of variables here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. And again, I think if you start to see a change in the rate environment, the markets stabilize, there's money
being held out in, like, brokered CDs and stuff that when they mature could possibly come back in and when
money is more active in investing, then they keep more in the sweep and the balances to deploy.
So, there's a number of different variables. We can't really predict that, but our cash rate that's holding in sweep is
pretty low. So, if anything, we think that if activity picks up, that could increase again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And so do you think that now that we've had stability in the sweep, likewise, we can think about maybe
there's a little bit of a lag or whatnot, but there's some stability in NII when we sum up both the on balance sheet
15

and off balance sheet, which has been a quarterly kind of slide and a little bit here year-to-date. Are we at a
period where maybe that's going to begin to flat line and return to the algorithm of growing with cash balances?
Rates, all else equal, of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, we do. There is opportunity there, and we do see that we have opportunity to grow NII...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Outstanding. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
...for the reasons that you mentioned. And certainly, as we have the maturities coming in [ph] because of the short
duration (00:43:10) and other elements coming up and those factors, we certainly feel comfortable saying yes on
that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks very much.

Operator: The next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. First question was, can you give a sense of how much bank assets will mature next year
to reinvest that potentially higher rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
You're saying on buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No. Maturing bank assets that would be reinvested.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I believe it's – again, it's in the area of about $2 billion, I believe, but we'll confirm that with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, I had one more question on the $32 billion of third-party cash. Do you view the
opportunity primarily, as clients move more money back into the market to capture some of that through wrap or
16


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
(AMP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
do you think there's some opportunity to capture some of the $32 billion with the bank products that you're rolling
now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, I would probably say, the first and foremost would be, as I said, with the market, I would think that more
would go back to work in solutions like wrap that would have a balance of equities and fixed incomes and [ph]
alternative stuff (00:44:41) along those lines.
I also feel like as we do roll out some of these other products that yes, it will garner some internal cash as well
rather than moving it out into other vehicles like a brokered CD and just based on a combination of the
environment and the security of Ameriprise.
So, we do feel comfortable about that as well. But I would probably say the larger opportunity would be moving
back into solutions like wrap business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
