Good morning. Thank you, Cal. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to start today by
acknowledging the impacts of Hurricane Ian on many within our geographic footprint. Many of you have
experienced widespread and long-lasting destruction in the wake of the storm. The individuals and communities
impacted by the storm have been in our thoughts. But, more importantly, we stand ready and are already working
to help with the recovery and rebuilding efforts.
As a long-standing Southeastern bank, we understand the importance of hurricane preparation to ensure the
safety and soundness of our clients, our employees, and ultimately of the bank. To that end, a comprehensive
client and employee outreach program, in addition to implementing network and operational safeguards, are the
keys to appropriately navigating potential impacts of a storm.
As the storm approached and passed, we fully implemented our business continuity plan with no disruptions to
client account access throughout the storm. And we've conducted a comprehensive client outreach initiative
beginning the day after the storm passed.
Today, a low volume of deferrals have been requested by our clients, and we have confidence overall that our
customer base has not experienced damage that will produce permanent financial stress, collateral impairment or
long-term business interruption due to the storm. We also continue to care for our team members, clients, and
communities impacted by the hurricane.
Through generous donations of our team members and company contributions to our Here Matters Disaster
Relief Fund, we continue to help affected team members recover. We also made a significant contribution to the
Florida Disaster Relief Fund to help with the long-term needs communities will face as they rebuild. Many of the
leadership team joined me last week, visiting our locations and team members in the Southwest Florida region.
The words that resonated the most with me were resilience and perseverance. Everyone is helping one another
and displays a passion and commitment to rebuild and return to a level of normalcy.
Shifting to our third quarter financial performance, we're extremely proud of the accomplishments and results we
released earlier today. This was driven by continued solid loan growth and strong margin expansion coupled with
excellent credit metrics and a 50% efficiency ratio.
In evaluating year-to-date performance, I believe the third quarter is indicative of the year. Strong loan growth,
ongoing deposit pricing discipline and prudent expense management have resulted in very strong net income and
PPNR growth for the year. However, we know there continues to be economic uncertainty ahead. Therefore, we
will prioritize and remain resilient around the key safety and soundness components, including capital, liquidity
and credit.
Nonetheless, with the continued strong performance of our core businesses, as well as our new initiatives which
will begin to generate income, we feel certain we will perform well through this cycle and reach the other side as a
stronger, more diversified company consistent with our longer-term, top quartile objectives.

Let me provide a brief update on some of our new initiatives as I know, Jamie will cover our core business
performance story as he shares the quarterly financials. Maast, our banking-as-a-service platform continues to
progress with beta testing of our first integrated software provider client. In fact, we expect to add a second client
to beta testing in the fourth quarter and remain focused on an early 2023 official launch. With a pilot solution in
place we're enhancing testing, functionality and capabilities throughout the remainder of the year.
While we strengthen the product offering and expand the pilot into other B2B segments, we continue to recruit top
talent to prepare for the launch and build out phases 2 and 3 of the product offering. We remain committed and
confident to this opportunity and our teams are working diligently to ensure we deliver a differentiated product
early next year.
In addition, we announced last week we continue to build out our corporate and investment banking team with
coverage and credit product leaders onboarded for our healthcare services vertical, as well as our [ph] leader for
(00:06:03) debt capital markets. We've also closed our first transactions in the technology, media and
communications, as well as the financial institutions verticals. With all of our vertical leads now in place, we
expect to accelerate adding new business in the months and quarters ahead.
We continue to make investments in our treasury and payment solutions that will serve as new sources of
revenue, and we'll roll out new analytical capabilities in the consumer business in the fourth quarter that will
provide opportunities to strengthen and deepen existing relationships.
We also continue to be pleased with one of our newest industry verticals, our restaurant specialty group. With $71
million in loan growth this quarter, this brings the portfolio to $545 million. I'm also happy to announce that we
raised our base wage to $20 per hour in the third quarter, which we feel will offset some of the inflationary
pressures felt by our team members and ensure we have a competitive compensation structure to continue to
attract and retain talent.
Overall, I believe we continue to execute exceptionally well on our strategic plan. This success is directly
attributable to our 5,000-plus team members who serve our clients and internal partners with a purpose. This
continued focus on execution allows us to perform at a high level, regardless of the underlying economic
conditions. I am truly humbled and proud of what you do every day.
Let me turn to slide 3 and our financial highlights for the quarter. Net income year-over-year was up 9%, led by
total revenue for the third quarter of $582 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter.
The revenue increase was driven by NII growth, a result of continued healthy loan growth, and a 27-basis-point
expansion in net interest margin.
PPNR was $288 million for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year, representing the highest level seen in
over 15 years. This performance led to adjusted EPS of $1.34, return on average assets of 1.39% and return on
tangible common equity of 21.4%, as well as an efficiency ratio of 50%, all representing excellent operating
metrics, which serves as validation of the team's continued execution.
Loans increased $1.4 billion or 3% quarter-over-quarter, with diversified growth across all segments. Commercial
loans again served as the primary driver of growth. It is reaffirming to see loan growth in all of our business units
again this quarter, leading to our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit loan growth.
Deposits declined 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by balanced diminishment and rate-bearing balances. As we
have shared previously, our clients continue to maintain average balances that are higher than pre-pandemic

levels. However, during the third quarter, we saw a decline in average balances as clients utilized their cash in
business-related investments, and commercial and consumers sought higher return alternatives. Despite the
diminishment, net production has continued to increase and we remain focused on our efforts to grow deposit
relationships over time.
Our underlying credit performance continues to trend positively as our NPA, NPL and criticized classified ratios
remain stable and quarterly charge-offs dropped to historically low levels. As we have noted before, the
performance of our loan book is a function of portfolio diversification and a strict adherence to our disciplined
credit framework. We remain cautiously optimistic on the near-term outlook for credit. Lastly, capital ratios remain
consistent quarter-over-quarter, representing both our strong earnings and our focus on deploying capital to client
loan growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Jamie to continue the overview of our quarterly results in greater detail. Jamie?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide 4. Total loan balances ended the third quarter
at $43 billion, reflecting growth of $1.4 billion. On an annualized basis, excluding the impact of PPP, this
represents a growth rate of 14%, our fifth consecutive quarter of annualized double-digit loan growth. Once again,
this growth was broad-based with contributions from wholesale, community, consumer, and CIB business funds.
Growth was led by CRE, which increased $785 million quarter-on-quarter. This was a function of loan production
paired with a slowdown in payoff velocity. Slower levels of payoffs relative to those experienced in the first half of
the year contributed approximately $350 million to CRE growth in the quarter. Growth was once again led by the
multifamily and medical property sectors, which represent the highest levels of credit quality within the CRE
segment.
With regards to C&I, growth was led by the wholesale line of business. In addition, increased utilization from C&I
commitments existing at the end of the second quarter contributed approximately $170 million to quarter-over-
quarter growth. Consumer loan balances increased $148 million, driven by mortgage and home equity lending.
Third-party consumer loan balances remain flat quarter-over-quarter. As we've communicated previously, we
leverage our third-party consumer portfolio as a means to complement our overall balance sheet positioning. And
as we look forward, we expect to redirect pay downs within that portfolio to support our core growth opportunities.
Turning to slide 5; the third quarter saw a continuation of the industry-wide headwinds for deposit growth with our
deposit balances declining 3% quarter-on-quarter. These declines were a result of a host of factors, including the
pressure from high rate non-bank alternatives, as well as disciplined deposit pricing. Deposit production remained
strong in Q3.
Our focus remains on what we can control and that is continuing to work to grow deposits both from existing
relationships and new business initiatives, which over the long-term should be the basis for value creation for all
of our stakeholders.
As we look at deposit rates, our average cost of deposits increased 23 basis points in the third quarter to 0.38%.
That compares to an average of 0.5% for the month of September, which equates to a total deposit beta of
approximately 15% for this cycle using average rates for the month of September. This is lower than the 30% total
deposit beta we previously estimated in July for a scenario in which policy rates reached current levels. The
5

existing variance appears to be attributable to the recent pace of interest rate hikes and the associated lags in
deposit repricing.
While this unprecedented tightening cycle is creating an uncertain environment for rates and deposit pricing, if the
FOMC continues to tighten to the 4.5% area on policy rates as implied by the recent dot plot, we would expect
some further upward pressure on total deposit beta for the cycle, placing it in the range of 35% to 40%.
Now on to slide 6. The combination of disciplined deposit pricing, continued strong loan growth, and interest rate
increases in the third quarter serve to support significant growth in net interest income, which came in at $478
million, an increase of 24% year-over-year or 12% quarter-over-over.
The net interest margin was 3.49% in the third quarter, an increase of 27 basis points from the second quarter, as
shown in the NIM waterfall, the impact of higher short-term rates boosted loan yields as greater than 60% of our
loans are now floating rate. Higher loan yields were partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding cost.
As we look forward, the pace of NII growth will be impacted by the timing of deposit repricing, interest rate policy,
and loan growth. We expect NII to be driven primarily by balance sheet expansion and [ph] long end (00:14:31)
repricing as we move past this rate hiking cycle.
Slide 7 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $105 million, up $5 million from the previous quarter and
down $9 million year-over-year. Our depth of relationships and stability in core banking fees and wealth revenue
act as a source of strength despite volatile capital markets and a continued depressed residential mortgage
environment.
Notably, wealth revenue grew 5%, despite a 17% year-over-year decline in the equity markets. This highlights the
diversity of the non-bank, non-market-based revenue streams within our wealth segment in areas such as trust
and family office. In addition, wealth revenue was benefited by fees generated from clients' movement into short-
term investments such as repos. This is further evidence of the pressure put on deposits in Q3 from non-bank
short-term liquidity alternatives.
Moving on to expenses slide 8 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $294 million, up $10 million from
the prior quarter and up $27 million year-over-year, which represents a 10% increase. Employment expense
increased 9% year-over-year, primarily attributable to the impacts of merit, elevated performance incentives, and
team member additions.
As mentioned earlier, we increased the minimum wage to $20 per hour. This increase and other related
compensation changes will result in additional spend of $2 million in the fourth quarter and an increased annual
spend of approximately $9 million.
Similar to previous quarters, when segmenting our year-over-year increase in expenses, the majority of the
growth is attributable to performance-related costs and investments in new business initiatives such as CIB and
Maast. We expect expenses associated with these new growth initiatives and infrastructure investments to
increase $6 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter efficiency ratio of 50% is evidence that we
are effectively managing our expense base while making these strategic investments.
Moving to slide 9 on credit quality. Our credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations
remained strong. The NPA and NPL ratios remain stable overall and are at or near historically low levels at 0.32%
6


Synovus Financial Corp.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
and 0.29% respectively. The net charge-off ratio was 0.04% for the quarter, representing the lowest charge-off
rate we have seen in recent years.
In the second quarter, our ACL was $479 million or 1.13% of loans. Given continued elevated strong loan growth,
the ACL increased $21 million quarter-on-quarter, while the ACL ratio remained relatively flat. This ratio reflects
the quality of the loan portfolio, offset by a more negative economic outlook.
Although we do believe that a more challenging economic environment could impact credit performance metrics,
we are confident in the composition and strength of our loan portfolio. We have emphasized diversification and
specialization across several facets of our commercial lending lines, and we have been targeted and selective in
the sectors and industries in which we win. Lastly, our prime-focused conservatively underwritten consumer
portfolio is well positioned for a potential downturn.
As noted on slide 10, the common equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.51%. Within the quarter, core
earnings supported robust capital generation, which was largely redeployed back into prudent balance sheet
growth. I would highlight that this is the fourth consecutive quarter of stable capital ratios near the midpoint of our
9.25% to 9.75% range, a result which is evidence of our focus on diligently managing our capital position
consistent with our internally established targets.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our focus remains on prioritizing capital deployment toward our core growth
opportunities. The slower pace of loan growth expected in Q4 will likely result in a year end CET1 within the upper
half of our 9.25% to 9.75% range. In light of the uncertain economic environment, we believe further supporting
our capital position in the upper half of the range makes sense. And similar to this quarter, we do not expect any
further share repurchases in 2022.
I'll now turn it back over to Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll now continue with our updated guidance for the quarter as shown on slide 11. We remain
on track to deliver our pledged $175 million of pre-tax Synovus Forward benefits by the end of this year. At the
end of the third quarter, our annual revenue run rate stood at over $160 million, and the continued execution of
our efficiency and growth initiatives will result in benefits in excess of our stated target. Synovus Forward is now
embedded in a continuous improvement mindset that will continue long after this initiative is formally complete,
especially as we continue to operate in more volatile economic conditions.
As a result of our strong loan growth of 3% in the third quarter, we are raising our total year loan growth ex-PPP
guidance to approximately 11%, which implies fourth quarter loan growth tapering a bit from the growth levels
delivered in Q3. This loan growth combined with a Fed funds target rate of 4% to 4.5% by the end of the year
results in total expected annual revenue growth, excluding PPP revenue of 15% to 16%.
And on the expense side, we are expecting year-over-year adjusted expense growth of 7% to 8%, a result of
incentives and costs tied to strong performance and targeted business investments. And as we've stated
previously, our employee incentive structures are tightly aligned with overall performance. And as such, the strong
forecasted revenue performance this year has resulted in higher incentive expectations.

Given the strong positive operating leverage resulting from this year's performance, our expectations for year-
over-year adjusted PPNR growth ex-PPP is now 25% to 27%. I am pleased with the progress we continue to
make as an organization and remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable top quartile performance.
2022 is shaping up to be an outstanding year in terms of our financial performance, one that fully exceeded our
original and most recent expectations. Reflecting back on our Investor Day in February, I could not be more
pleased with our progress. We stated that we had to increase productivity, deepen client relationships, and deliver
ongoing efficiencies while leveraging strategic investments to create an elevated growth profile.
We have increased productivity in loans, deposits, and assets under management production during the year;
deepened relationships utilizing analytics and good old-fashioned partnerships; managed expense growth by
closing 28 branch locations; and maintained progress on our new initiatives. Matching our actions with our
promises in a manner our team has in 2022 is even more impressive, given the volatility in the economy and
many causes from which it stems.
Going forward, we will adjust and alter our path where necessary as we remain agile in navigating the ever-
changing economic and competitive landscape. I want to again thank our 5,000-plus team members. You are the
secret to our success, and your efforts and contributions are not unnoticed by our leaders, clients or key
stakeholders.

So, when I look at your capital, with the AOCI impact, your TCE continues to move down here. It's now 5.5%. But
if you look at common equity Tier 1, it's still at a great level at 9.5%, but there's such a differential between those
two ratios. As the TCE continues to move lower, is there any impact to Synovus from that?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Brady, it's Jamie. Good morning. As we think about capital ratio, we primarily focus in on CET1, and the reason
for that is look at the impact to tangible common equity of AOCI is basically a timing difference and only a partial
story of what's happening as a result of interest rates.
As you're well aware, Synovus performs better in a higher rate environment. But when you mark-to-market
components of the balance sheet like the securities portfolio, you can see there's parts of it where the value
declines, whereas, there are many more parts where the value increases.
And so as we think about capital and how we manage our balance sheet, how we protect the balance sheet, we
primarily focus in on CET1 and regulatory capital. And as you can see by our earnings today and our strategy for
the rest of the year, it's our intent to build capital through the rest of the year, retain earnings, and build capital in
dollar form. You can see that we're deploying it to clients, which is our key strategic objective, and we expect to
continue that through year end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then, Jamie, can you give us a little more color on the swaps that Synovus has added over
the last year or so? I think as of the end of the second quarter, it was a little over $5 billion [ph] received fixed paid
(00:25:05) floating. Can you just help us think about the impact that those swaps have on earnings and if they
have any impact on capital, like, from a mark-to-market point of view and any changes that may have happened
in that swap portfolio in 3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. And you did see a little bit of change in the swap portfolio in the third quarter. But it's
not what you would normally expect. It was more tied to hedging, debt, or deposits – broker deposits. And so,
when I think about the core swap portfolio, swaps against our loan portfolio, it remained stable.
And what we have right now is we have about $5.25 billion of exposure that'll mature over the next few years, and
it will be impactful to earnings. It's not impactful to regulatory capital, but it is impactful to what we were just –
discussion on tangibles.
When we think about the impact to earnings going forward, unfortunately, the maturities are somewhat lumpy.
And so, there'll be some quarters where we have more maturities than others. And those maturities will be a
benefit to the following quarter's NII. The biggest quarter that we have coming up with maturities would be the
second quarter, and we have approximately $1 billion of maturities at around a 1.4% received fixed rate. And so,
that'll be accretive to NII in 2023 once those mature. But it will be lumpy and it will come in over the next few
years.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the deposit side. So, prior to [ph] Q3 (00:27:05), non-interest bearing deposits were about
25% of the deposit base, now they're around 35%. How should we think about pressure on non-interest bearing
balances from here, right, will it get worse than what we just saw this quarter? And ultimately, are we headed
back towards 25%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hi, Steven. This is Jamie. I'll jump in first. We spend a lot of time thinking about that, and we think about our NIB
as a percent of total deposits. We believe that they will be relatively stable maybe decline a few percent as we go
through this cycle. And the reason we believe that is, one, we've seen strong client growth. And so, our
relationship managers out in the field are bringing on new clients. They're driving that business. And we believe
that over the long-term, that'll lead to sustained growth.
But then, on a more technical side, we also looked at prior cycles. And so, we looked at the cycle in the early
2000s, 2004, 2007. And if you look at DDA during that cycle, you did see some declines. It was about 4%. But
then, when you look at the cycle from 2015 to 2018, DDA as a percent of total deposits did not decline. And so,
we think that that also gives us a little bit of comfort that you may see some slight declines in that percentage, but
we're not expecting anything outside of those prior cycles.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Steven, I'll just add, interesting enough, when you look at non-interest-bearing deposits relative to core
deposits, they actually increased this quarter from 35 to 36. And so, as we've seen money market attrition, we've
actually had DDA hold on better than some of the rate-seeking clients that have moved to other instruments.

To Jamie's point, I think the great opportunity that we have in front of us is what we've been doing for the last
three years in terms of investing in treasury and payment solutions.
So, when you ask yourself, why would someone keep their money in a non-interest-bearing account? They're
doing that because they're receiving services from our treasury and payment solutions team, and they're
offsetting that with their earnings credit rate. But as we continue to grow our commercial business, our ability to
win business, as Jamie suggested, in that commercial space is very high and will actually continue to accelerate.
And so, as we continue to improve our products and solutions, we have the opportunity to have outsized growth in
new production of DDA, which could help to mitigate any diminishment that we would see going forward.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
If we stay with that as my follow-up, so this quarter you saw a very nice NIM expansion. But I mean, the question
we're asking everybody is, what's the trajectory from here? Seems like for most banks, 4Q is going to be
somewhat similar to 3Q, but does your NIM then peak?
It sounds like a lot of banks are guiding to NIM peaking in the first half of next year, and then the wildcard is can
you hold it at that level or Jamie, you talked about this pickup in deposit betas [ph] with a lag (00:30:07). Does it
trend down in the second half? How are you thinking about that from a high level here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steven, this is the key question. As we look at it, first, we're really pleased with what the team delivered in
the third quarter. I think that our performance on managing deposit calls, managing the balance sheet was strong
and it led to a strong quarter of NII. And so, we are really pleased with that.
And when we look forward – and this is embedded in our total revenue guide for the full year, the midpoint of that
is an expectation that NII will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter from these elevated third quarter levels. And
that's a combination of – you'll see some of the impact of prior rate hikes on deposit calls in the fourth quarter.
And we're expecting, obviously, further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
There are potential tailwinds to that, which would be the liquidity environment and what happens outside of the
banking industry. But that could also be a headwind. And so, we will see as we go through the fourth quarter. But
to your real question, beyond that, we would expect to see an NII and a margin headwind from deposit pricing
lags once the Fed tightening cycle is over. And that will be a near-term impact.
For us, I believe, as we look forward further out that will be offset by the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing. I
mentioned derivatives maturities earlier, also the repricing of the securities portfolio, also the repricing of our
mortgage portfolio. I mean, it's a little more than $20 billion of fixed rate exposure that'll reprice over time, and
that'll be a nice tailwind for us.
So, when I think about NII, we think that the fourth quarter should be relatively stable to the third quarter. But
looking out beyond that, when we look at 2023 – and we'll give full year guidance in January. But when we look at
the longer term, we do believe that the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing will fairly offset the negative impact of
deposit lags, and we may see NII in 2023 approximate loan growth year-over-year.

Obviously, your asset quality was terrific this quarter. Can you talk about any signs of normalization you're
[indiscernible] (00:32:57) any different portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Oh, hi, Jennifer. It's Bob. Just real quick, yeah, thanks for the question. But I think where we sit today, we're
benefiting from the liquidity that was in the system through the pandemic. You look at our charge-off ratio over
time, go back to maybe 2016 to 2020 when we were in the 20 to 30 basis point range.
And then, as we went through the pandemic, obviously, it got on a pretty direct slope downward and we're kind of
leveling off here at fairly low levels. We would anticipate that you would see a return to something in that range as
we go forward.
My only caveat to that would be if we remain in a restrictive-type policy for a longer period of time, certainly, we
would expect credit cost to continue to perhaps move up to another range or a higher level. As of today, however,
we just aren't seeing the migration. We aren't seeing the defaults. We aren't seeing significant changes in
modification request, etcetera. So, right now, my bias is towards stable. But, certainly, looking ahead, we could
expect some headwinds there as it relates to credit.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And, Kevin, could you talk about the CIB business and where it is today versus your expectations
maybe earlier this year, in February, during the Investor Day?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jennifer, I think it's exciting to see now that we have all three of our managing directors that are leading our
verticals in place and with the talent. As we've shared in the past, we've been very excited about the talent we're
bringing on and being able to recruit talent from some of the larger institutions. And now we have some credit
product specialists, debt capital markets, and we're starting to see deals being booked.
And we had two deals, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this quarter. Our pipeline is over $100 million.
And what's great about that, Jennifer, is it's not just about participating in deals. We have some lead opportunities
in front of us. And I give Tom Deardorff and his team a great deal of credit in that they've been able to attract top
talent that have hit the ground running.
So, I'm more [indiscernible] (00:35:24) than I probably was even last quarter, just because we're starting to see
traction. We're winning deals. The pipelines are building. Bob has brought in a credit team to support them, which
we think has been an incredible help to the team in terms of prospecting. So, I'm more optimistic today.
You may ask the question, how would we think about it going forward in an economic recession. I wouldn't think
differently about it. I think the team we have in place today will continue to provide great credit opportunities and
be able to cross-sell depository and treasury opportunities, even in an economy that's not growing as fast.
So, for me, I'm just happy we have another lever for our growth engine as we think about the future with the
market slowing potentially with a potential recession.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Can I ask one more question about loan growth? You said it'd be slowing in the fourth quarter. Is that because
you're being more selective now with a more uncertain economy or are you seeing the pipeline slowdown from
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jennifer, it's a really good question. As we think – just first talked about this quarter, when you think about
$1.4 billion in loan growth, we saw fairly stable production. We also saw payoffs and pay downs slow
considerably, predominantly in the CRE space. And so, that contributed a little extra growth as we saw the payoff
activity slow down.
As we look out into the fourth quarter, we are seeing some slowing in activity from our clients' pipeline. Pipelines
are down 15%, 20% from where they were in the third quarter. So, when you think about just a 20%, 15%
reduction in production, that would produce somewhere around a $700 million to $1 billion loan growth for the
quarter.
Now, the variables there will continue to be what happens with the payoff activity and, ultimately, what happens
with the utilization. This quarter, we saw only 20-basis-point increase in utilization and on the same line increase
about $180 million. So, it will slow a bit, but the wildcard there is what will happen with payoff activities. But yes,
production is slowing just a little bit.

Thanks so much.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, maybe I wanted to start with expenses. I appreciate you guys had a great
revenue year, and, obviously, the incentive comp has drifted up. Just curious, because of the great revenue, have
you, in your mind, been able to pull forward any expenses maybe from 2023, make any additional investments
that maybe could soften some of the inflationary pressure that we're seeing across the industry? I know you're not
giving 2023 guidance, but just, kind of, curious if you, in your mind, kind of, brought any of that forward to, kind of,
ease maybe 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a great question. But, on the expense side, I would say we have two things going, and this will be our story for
2023 as well, is we have core expenses, which is how we operate our existing business, and then we have the
spend for the future with our strategic growth initiatives.
But when you look at our core expense base, it's very well-managed. And you see strong performance year-over-
year, you see active management. But we're not stopping or not spending – we are not stopping spending when
we need to. Clearly this is an inflationary environment. You saw we just announced our minimum wage increasing
to $20 an hour.
We're actively out there, ensuring that we're competitive, that we have the right compensation structures to have
the strongest team out there in the Southeast and so we feel really good about what we've been doing on today's
expenses. And that's what should you expect to see for us in 2023, active management of what we can control
ensuring that we're doing everything we can to build the best team, maintain the best team.

But then also our stated plan is made for – through the cycle. This is clearly an uncertain economic environment.
But if you look at our strategic plan, what we laid out on February 8th remains the same as what we're saying
today. These are all long-term plans that we believe position us for the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thank you. And as my follow-up, Jamie, it looked like average long-term debt went from, maybe just under
$900 million to $2.7 billion on the average balance sheet. And I know some of these categories are lumped
together, but you finished the quarter with almost $4.5 billion of long-term debt. Can you – I know there was a
small issuance in August, but just kind of curious what you did there, maybe how it's structured, rate, term,
etcetera, just kind of want to [indiscernible] (00:40:31) kind of the moving parts to make sure I didn't miss
something there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brad, what you're seeing there is largely home loan bank advances. Now, those are considered long-term,
but they're floating rate [indiscernible] (00:40:47) debt. And when you think about those funding costs, I would just
think about that as basically a Fed funds funding or SOFR – short-term SOFR rate funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Thank you. I was a little confused considering the long-term data. Okay. Appreciate the clarity. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons of D.A. Davidson. Kevin, your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just dovetail a little on Brad's question there. Just curious, Jamie, how we should
– I know there was a question earlier about non-interest-bearing deposits, but just your outlook for overall deposit
levels going forward, do we continue to see a modest decline?
And I'm assuming more modest decline going forward versus third quarter. And then, do you continue to offset
that with the borrowings you were just referring to? And more broadly, how you feel about that loan-to-deposit
ratio, which I think now has gone up to 89% where that stands relative to where you want to be longer term.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Kevin, as we look forward on deposits, you can see in our loan guide, where we're forecasting, as Kevin
mentioned earlier, strong growth in the fourth quarter. And we are expecting – and look, this is a highly uncertain
environment on the deposit front, but we are expecting to see deposit growth in the fourth quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Now, it'll be likely slower growth, but we are expecting to see growth in the fourth quarter and expect – that's our
current baseline, we've seen grow quarter-to-date, we expect to maintain that through year-end.
When you think about the loan-to-deposit ratio, if you look back over the longer term, we have run for years in the
upper 90s, 96% to 98% loan-to-deposit ratio. It's not our intent to get back to those levels in the medium-term, but
you should expect to see that increase. And so we will look to use all of the liquidity levers that we have, but you
should expect to see that increase.
One of those liquidity levers that I would highlight is our third-party lending portfolio. Clearly, you've seen strong
client growth from us for five consecutive quarters. And it is our intent – it has always been our intent, to use that
third-party portfolio as a source of liquidity. And so you should expect to see that [ph] trade (00:43:47) over time
given the strong client loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Kevin, given the topic, I told, Jamie, I'd want to jump in on deposits. Obviously, I think it's important to
understand what happened in the third quarter to be able to project what's going to happen in the future. And our
team's done a good job of looking at the outflows this quarter.
About 35% of our declines, our diminishment this quarter, were a function of just seasonality. We had another
25% where our customers were deploying their liquidity predominantly on the commercial side, investing in new
investments, expanding their capital. So that leaves about 40% of the decline. And about 20% of that we were
able to move to alternative higher yielding liabilities for them.
And that included – we added about $700 million this quarter off balance sheet in our repo products. So that
leaves about 20% or $450 million that left the company to pursue higher balances.
And so as we go forward, having a good understanding of how we mitigate some of that activity, but our
production on the deposit side continues to increase. We saw another quarter about 25% increase in net
production and that included increased production in DDA. And we've gotten more active back in CD promotions.
And so as we go forward, our actions around deposits will be very consistent. To Jamie's point, we'll continue to
focus on generating new deposits. We'll continue to focus on mitigating some of the diminishment that's
happening. And our investments over the last several years, as I mentioned earlier, with treasury will help.
We're also looking at some new industries and verticals that will help to supplement some of our asset generation
with deposit generation, including money service businesses which we rolled out last quarter. So, our focus
internally is understanding some of the diminishment, but continuing to focus on the new production that will allow
us to generate growth going forward, to Jamie's point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Kevin, and thanks, Jamie. Appreciate all that. One quick follow-up, Jamie. I think you mentioned
earlier about what the deposit costs were in September. I was wondering if you happen to have them handy, if
you had maybe what the actual margin, what the loan yields, deposit costs were for September. And then maybe
any color you can provide on betas like what they were last cycle, what you're assuming this cycle would be great.
Thanks.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll focus in on the deposit side for the month of September. When you look at interest-bearing deposits for
the month of September, it was approximately 72 basis points; total deposits, approximately 50 basis points. That
was laid out in the deck.
When you look at the through-the-cycle beta through September, from the beginning to September, you have a
15% total deposit beta, a 22% interest-bearing deposit beta. And if you were to look at period to period, quarter-
to-quarter betas, it'd be 19% interest – I'm sorry, 25% interest-bearing deposit beta and 18% total deposit beta.
As we've said in the past, our expectation was when we thought the debt might end at current levels at 3.25%
through the cycle, total deposit beta will be around 30%. And as we said in the prepared remarks today, if we
assume that the Fed goes to the mid-4s then we would expect our through-the-cycle total deposit beta, to be
somewhere between 35% and 40%.
And I want to give a little more color on that range. So, the 35% would be what we would consider closer to our
base case. And that implies beyond a 3.25% Fed funds rate, beyond that 30% through-the-cycle beta, the 3.25%
that you have an incremental 50% total deposit beta. And that would get you to an approximate 35% through-the-
cycle beta, with a terminal Fed rate of 4.5%.
And that's, kind of – that would be our current base case. We do believe the through-the-cycle beta could be
higher, which is why we gave the range, given what we saw last quarter, with non-bank liquidity alternatives and
competition from non-bank alternatives to deposits. And if that were to continue, if that were to increase, then you
could see higher through-the-cycle betas.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
...just one quick follow-up on that. Do you think that we could get to – could we see the faster acceleration to that
through-the-cycle beta than we've seen so far or do you really think that it's just, sort of, a continued, sort of,
steady progression higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
If you go back and look at prior cycles, then you should expect to see an acceleration. So, if you look at the 2004
to 2006 tightening cycle, you definitely see an acceleration the further you get along in the tightening cycle. The
same thing happened in 2016 to 2018. And that's what we are expecting.
And so, when you look at the – quarter-on-quarter you have a total deposit beta of 18%. And then, we're
forecasting that just to continue increasing. And I just mentioned, getting up to as high as potentially the 15%
incremental beta, which leads to a through-the-cycle in the mid-30s. And that's generally what we expect to see
happen. But yes, you should see an acceleration in betas as we go through this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just as my follow-up, could you give a little color on what the sentiment from your
commercial customers is as we're continuing into this period of maybe broader economic uncertainty? Are they
still out there talking about growing and investing or are you seeing them start to become more cautious and
maybe pull back a little bit more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Jared, I'll start and I'll ask Bob if he wants to add anything from a credit standpoint. I think in general, it's still
cautiously optimistic. I think you have to go back to what we talk about in terms of demographics in the Southeast
and the continued outperformance of our footprint in terms of population growth and business starts. And so, I
think relatively speaking, none of those elements have changed, even though the economy is looking to slow a
bit.
So, as there is continuing to be economic growth in the footprint we'll continue to have folks that want to deploy
capital. I do think, as I mentioned earlier in the call, pipelines have diminished a bit. And I think that's correlated to
the sentiment of our business owners that they do see a slowing going forward. I think part of that has been –
there's been a bit of a backlog with supply chain and what's been going on post-COVID.
But in general, there's still a positive sentiment. We're not seeing people that are overly concerned, but we're
seeing a level of prudence and people are being conservative. Bob mentioned it earlier, they're still carrying a lot
of cash on their balance sheets, and so they still have a lot of dry powder if things were to go negative. And, quite
frankly, with rates rising, they're able to use some of that cash instead of using higher cost debt. But I'm still
cautiously optimistic, and I think that's predicated on what we're hearing from them.
Bob, would you add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jared, the only thing I would add is we started last quarter with a commercial survey and did it again this
quarter, so two surveys in a row. The difference I would highlight in those surveys is we're beginning to see our
18


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
customers tell us that their input costs are beginning to wane a little bit and so, early signs that perhaps inflation
might be easing somewhat.
The other thing I would point to in those surveys that our customers still feel, as Kevin said, relatively optimistic
about their pipelines in their businesses going forward. So, not just anecdotal, but results of that survey.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Kevin, you gave us the update on Maast earlier in the call. And I was just curious.
As Maast comes online next year, to what extent can that be a positive contributor to kind of core deposit growth
for the Synovus engine in 2023 and 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a great point because I think we've talked a lot about Maast and its ability to generate fee income through the
payments products. But it also can be a big deposit generator. And it would be too early for me to prognosticate
what those average balances are going to be.
But as we've gone through this pilot with our first ISV, we've onboarded over 800 recurring billers. These are the
customers of the ISV. We've also opened up our website from a sales perspective, and we've received 800
unique customers coming to the website with the click-through rates that are three times the average of what you
see in the industry.
So, as we've talked about in the past, there continues to be a great deal of excitement from these software
providers to the product. The other thing is we've been talking to more folks about being able to deliver it in 2023.
What we're seeing is that the average number of customers per ISV is actually greater than what we had
modeled.
So, I give you all that as background because the only thing I can use to project what it's going to do for us is
what's happening with our pilot, the early interest that we're getting from ISVs and, as we've shared on previous
calls, it continues to be extremely positive. So, I believe that not only is it going to be a generator of fee income,
but it's also going to generate deposits that will help our growth in some of the other areas of the bank.

Great. Thanks for getting into the detail there. And I presume that – relatively speaking, the cost of those funds
would be less, it may not be zero, but it would be less than some other funding that you have.

Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. You'll have a DDA account that sweeps the receivables from the payment. But one of the things we'd want
to offer is that they could sweep that money into other interest-bearing accounts. So, you'd have a little bit of both.
You'd have both a non-interest-bearing component, as well as interest bearing. But it would be, I think, overall
more attractive than any sort of normal funding or wholesale funding, for example.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. Great. And Jamie, just a quick one. As you think about the level of debt, is there an upper bound to, kind of,
where you don't want it to crossover a certain threshold. I know it's not an exact science, but just, kind of, curious
as you think through the next several quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look forward on the debt side, I guess I would bifurcate the difference between collateralized borrowing at
the home loan bank and facilities like that, then corporate unsecured debt. We have a lot of liquidity, a significant
amount of liquidity at hand.
When you think about the ability to use home loan bank capacity, the ability to grow broker deposits from here,
the ability to grow core deposits, and so, we have a lot of different levers at hand, and we believe that using
liquidity sources like the third-party portfolio, allowing that to [indiscernible] (00:56:00) will benefit us. And we
believe that, kind of, those strategies can help hold off the need to issue any, sort of, corporate unsecured debt
which is clearly the highest cost of them all.

plan. I think most importantly, these results have been driven by our dedicated and hardworking team members
here at Synovus.
We have an outstanding team and a loyal client base, who truly values the relationships we take pride in
fostering, along with our exceptional advisory approach to serving our clients' financial needs.
I'm proud of the care our team members take to extend to our clients and the communities in which we serve. We
have a bright future here at Synovus, but we're not just betting on what is to come. Rather, we continue to deliver
in the present. This year, our core business performance and our asset sensitivity has translated into income
levels and operating metrics that are some of the best in our company's history.
Moving forward, rising rates may be less of a story, and economic growth is likely to contract. But we remain
optimistic that even in that environment, we will continue to perform in a strong relative fashion. Continued
enhancements in productivity, deepening of client relationships, coupled with the traction of our new business
initiatives, we will lead growth in loans, deposits and fee income. And it will put us in a position to deliver positive
operating leverage, allowing us to continue to outperform.
Again, thanks for joining our call today. We look forward to staying connected to this group as we continue to
deliver for our shareholders, our team members, clients and our communities. With that, Alex, we'll close out
today's call.
