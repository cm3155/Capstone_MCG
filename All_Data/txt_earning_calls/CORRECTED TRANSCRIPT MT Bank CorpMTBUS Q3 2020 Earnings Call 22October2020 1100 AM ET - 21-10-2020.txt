Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's press release, we were pleased with the
improving level of economic activity our markets experienced in the third quarter, particularly in terms of consumer
and business spending.
Specifically, we saw strong debit and credit card usage, both by consumers and business, which also manifested
in an increase in merchant volumes. The mortgage market was robust in the third quarter where we witnessed an
uptick in both residential origination volumes and margins.
Our trust business experienced the increase in money fund fee waivers we had been anticipating, but those were
offset by strong equity and debt markets during the quarter. Expense trends were in line with our expectations as
we continue to exercise diligence in a particularly difficult revenue environment. Also encouraging are the trends
for commercial customers granted some form of COVID-19 forbearance, and for which have reached its endpoint.
Approximately 10% have asked for additional relief.
The common equity Tier-1 ratio improved by 31 basis points to 9.81%. At the same time, the allowance for loan
losses grew to 1.79% of loans, positioning M&T to meet the needs of our customers and communities.
Now, let's review our results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.75 for the third
quarter of 2020 compared with $1.74 in the second quarter of 2020 and $3.47 in the third quarter of 2019. Net
income for the quarter was $372 million compared with $241 million in the linked quarter and $480 million in the
year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.06%
and an annualized return on average common equity of 9.53%. This compares with rates of 0.71% and 6.13%,
respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from
the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $3 million or $0.02 per common share, little change from the
prior quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as
well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $375 million
compared with $244 million in the linked quarter and $484 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating
earnings per common share were $2.77 for the recent quarter compared with $1.76 in 2020 second quarter and
$3.50 in the third quarter of 2019.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity of 1.1% and 13.94% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 0.74%
and 9.04% in the second quarter of 2020. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release
contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $947 million in
the third quarter of 2020, marking a decline of $14 million or 1% from the linked quarter. That decrease primarily

reflects the impact on loan yields from the 20 basis point decline in average one-month LIBOR compared to the
second quarter. Higher premium amortization on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities was
also a factor.
The net interest margin declined by 18 basis points to 2.95% compared with 3.13% in the linked quarter. Average
interest-earning assets increased by $4 billion to $128 billion for the third quarter, primarily reflecting a $4.4 billion
increase in funds invested with either the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or into resale agreements.
Those investments were funded by a similar increase in deposits, approximately evenly divided between interest
and non-interest-bearing DDA. The increase in cash equivalent investments caused an estimated 10 basis points
of pressure on the net interest margin, while having little effect on net interest income.
The lower interest rate environment, primarily the lower average rate on one-month LIBOR that I mentioned
previously, contributed to approximately 4 basis points of the margin decline. The net impact of lower loan yields
was somewhat mitigated by a 6 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits.
The accelerated premium amortization on both residential mortgage loans and on mortgage-backed securities
contributed some 3 basis points of margin pressure. All other factors contributed to an additional 1 basis point of
the decline.
For context, since the fourth quarter of 2019, the combination of short-term liquidity investments primarily placed
at the Fed and investment securities has increased by $9.1 billion, reducing the net interest margin by
approximately 25 basis points, while incrementally benefiting net interest income.
Average total loans increased by $413 million or a little less than 0.5% compared with the previous quarter.
Looking at loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial
loans declined by $1.4 billion, or 5%, primarily the results of a $1.2 billion decline in vehicle dealer floor plan
loans. That reflects the usual seasonal softness as well as the delays some dealers are having in replacing
inventory being sold.
PPP loans were effectively unchanged from the end of the second quarter at $6.5 billion. Commercial real estate
loans grew by less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Residential real estate loans increased by just
under $1 billion or 6%, reflecting loans purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools pending resolution, partially
offset by repayments.
Consumer loans were up by 4%, reflecting higher indirect recreation finance loans, partially offset by lower auto
loans and home equity lines of credit. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's
Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew by $4 billion, primarily in interest and noninterest checking
or about 4% compared with the second quarter.
Turning to noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $521 million in the third quarter compared with $487
million in the prior quarter. The recent quarter included $3 million of valuation gains on equity securities, largely on
our remaining holdings of GSE preferred stock, while the second quarter included $7 million of such gains.
Mortgage banking revenues were $153 million in the recent quarter, improving from $145 million in the linked
quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 7% from $1.1 billion in
the second quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities,
were $119 million in the third quarter, improved from $111 million in the prior quarter. The increase reflects the

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
higher volume of loans originated for sale combined with stronger gain on sale margins. Residential servicing
revenues declined very slightly.
Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $34 million, encompassing both originations and servicing, and
which was little changed from the second quarter. Trust income was $150 million in the recent quarter, down
slightly from $152 million in the previous quarter. Recall that second quarter figures included $5 million of
seasonal tax preparation fees. Aside from that, business remained solid with slightly higher money market fund
fee waivers offset by continued strong debt capital markets activity.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $91 million, improved sharply from $77 million in the second quarter.
The improvement comes primarily from some of the COVID-19-impacted categories on the consumer side, the
result of higher levels of spending compared with the prior quarter.
Similarly, the $20 million improvement in other revenues from operations compared with the linked quarter reflects
a rebound in COVID-19-impacted payments revenues that are not included in service charges such as credit card
interchange and merchant discount with a slight improvement in loan-related fees, including syndications.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible
assets, were $823 million compared with $803 million in the second quarter. The $20 million linked quarter
increase in salaries and benefits reflect the impact of one additional workday during the quarter and higher
compensation tied to the uptick in both mortgage banking and trust-related activity compared with the prior
quarter.
Recall that other cost of operations for each of the first and second quarters included a $10 million addition to the
valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights. There was neither an addition nor release from
the valuation allowance during the third quarter.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses
from the denominator, was 56.2% in the recent quarter, compared with 55.7% in the second quarter and 56.0% in
the third quarter of 2019.
Next, let's turn to credit. Net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $30 million. Annualized net charge-
offs as a percentage of total loans were 12 basis points for the third quarter compared to 29 basis points in the
second quarter. The provision for loan losses in the third quarter amounted to $150 million, exceeding net charge-
offs by $120 million and increasing the allowance for credit losses to $1.8 billion or 1.79% of loans.
The allowance at the end of the third quarter reflects an updated macroeconomic scenario that is different and
modestly less severe than those used at the end of the first and second quarters, which modeled the uncertainty
of the COVID-19-driven damage to the economy.
The allowance and the related provision in the recent quarter reflect ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors, the uncertainty over additional economic stimulus, and
the ultimate collectibility of commercial real estate loans where borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance.
Our current macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the
unemployment rate and GDP. Our forecast assumes the quarterly unemployment rate increases to 9% in the
fourth quarter of this year followed by a sustained high-single-digit unemployment rate through 2022. The forecast

assumes GDP contracts 5.1% during 2020 and recovers to pre-recession peak levels by the third quarter of 2022.
Our forecast assumes no additional government stimulus.
Nonaccrual loans as of September 30 amounted to $1.2 billion, an increase of $83 million from the end of June.
At the end of the quarter, nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans was 1.26%. It is important to keep in mind
that some of the usual credit metrics have been affected by the PPP loans on the balance sheet, which are zero
risk-weighted and carry little or no credit risk. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the ratio of the allowance for
credit losses to loans would be 1.91%.
Similarly, the ratio of nonaccrual to total loans would be 1.35% and annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of
total loans would be 13 basis points.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were $527 million at the end of the recent
quarter. Of these loans $505 million or 96% were guaranteed by government-related entities. Government-
guaranteed loan under COVID forbearance and which we have purchased from servicing pools are generally not
reflected in these figures.
Consistent with regulatory and CARES Act provisions, loans that have received some sort of forbearance,
whether payment deferrals, covenant modifications, or other form of relief as a result of COVID-19-related stress
for the most part are not yet reflected in our nonaccrual or delinquency numbers.
A significant majority of commercial loans that were granted COVID-19 payment relief were for 90 days with the
ability for clients to request second 90 days. For example, substantially all of the $4.2 billion of forbearance as of
June 30 given to vehicle dealers was for 90 days and less than $100 million are under some form of forbearance
relief at the end of the third quarter.
For the total commercial and industrial portfolio, including the aforementioned dealer portfolio, loans under
COVID-19 forbearance have declined by 85% to slightly higher than $800 million or about 3% as of September
30.
Customers in the commercial real estate portfolio generally received 180-day COVID-19 deferrals. In total
deferrals in the CRE portfolio have declined by 41% to $5.1 billion. Over two-thirds of the loans on active
forbearance as of September 30 that have not reached their endpoint relate to the CRE portfolio segments most
impacted by COVID-19, notably hotels and retail CRE. We'll know more over the next 60 days or so as the 180-
day deferrals reach their end of term.
For the consumer portfolios, deferrals declined from just under $700 million at June 30 to under $150 million or
less than 1% at the end of September. For residential mortgage loans we own, non-government-guaranteed loans
under deferral amount to $1.6 billion, down about 19% from the second quarter.
Total deferrals have increased to $3.3 billion from $2.3 billion 90 days ago. All of that increase reflects
government-guaranteed loans purchased from servicing pools that represent no credit risk to M&T. All of these
figures do not include approximately $10 billion of forbearance on residential mortgage loans we service for
others.
Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier-1 capital ratio was an estimated 9.81% as of September 30
compared to 9.5% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends

paid and slightly lower risk-weighted assets. M&T did not repurchase shares during the third quarter and will not
be doing so in the fourth quarter.
M&T's net income comfortably exceeded its common stock dividend, both for the quarter and under the trailing
four-quarter calculations outlined by the Federal Reserve.
Now turning to the outlook, our usual practice is to offer thoughts on the coming year in the January earnings calls
after we've completed our planning process. So, my remarks today will be somewhat brief.
We're all pleased to see that the economy has improved, while recognizing that we're still a long way from
conditions we saw in January and February. Core commercial loan growth, excluding PPP loans, has slowed and
we expect those balances to remain flat to slightly down over the remainder of 2020 compared to where we
ended the quarter.
Given that the auto manufacturers or still not running at normal levels, we don't expect the normal seasonal
rebound in dealer floor plan loans during the fourth quarter. Our portal for receiving forgiveness requests of PPP
loans is open and applications are being processed and sent on to the SBA.
Most of the activity so far is on the smaller loans, on which the SBA is expediting relief. The residential mortgage
loans we purchased from servicing pools aren't fully reflected in the third quarter average. Combined with the
potential for further buyouts, we should see modest growth in average residential mortgage loans for the current
quarter. All-in, we expect modest linked-quarter growth in total loans.
More difficult to forecast has been our liquidity assets or short-term investments and the deposits with the Fed,
which continued to rise over the past quarter, although at a much slower pace. As I noted earlier, this was
primarily the result of further deposit inflows. Although uncertain at present, we may be approaching the peak and
may see declines in the current quarter.
As both deposits and associated short-term investments decline, we'd expect that the net interest margin would
benefit by about 2 to 3 basis points per $1 billion decline with limited impact on net interest income.
With LIBOR having reached a steady state and our expectation for additional modest downward trends in deposit
costs, we expect net interest income to be slightly higher in the final quarter of 2020. If a significant balance of
PPP loans are forgiven, the accelerated recognition of the PPP loan fees would be a further benefit.
We've previously mentioned that the size of the active cash flow hedge position on our floating-rate loan portfolio
will step up during this quarter. To be more specific, the $13.4 billion notional amount of active cash flow hedges
will step up to $17.4 billion this quarter and then remain at those levels for about one year. The benefit to net
interest income is less substantive as the older swaps with higher fixed receive rates mature and forward starting
swaps with lower receive rates become active.
Turning to fees, residential mortgage applications continue to be strong with rates as low as they are. We expect
continued solid origination volumes this quarter, but likely with some pressure on margin. For trust income, we
have seen the increase in waivers of money market mutual fund management be somewhat offset by strong debt
capital markets activity. We expect those waivers will reach a steady state shortly and will persist while the zero-
rate environment endures.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Service charge income was boosted by higher levels of customer activity, notably in payments. With some
volumes at or even better than pre-COVID levels, further upside from the current levels appears likely – sorry,
unlikely.
We have no change to our expense guidance for the remainder of 2020. We continue to expect expenses for the
second quarter – or second half of the year – to be in line with the first half, excluding the seasonal factors in this
year's first quarter. Any additional loan loss provisioning will be determined by changes to the macroeconomic
variables that we see at the end of the year and by the portfolio composition.
Lastly, turning to capital, we are continuing to build capital levels as limited loan growth and profits in excess of
the dividend bolster our capital ratios. Consistent with the guidance from our regulators, we won't repurchase
stock or recommend that the board consider a change to the dividend during the fourth quarter.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions
regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other
macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
Now, let's open the call up to questions, before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.

Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the credit side, wondering if you could give us a little bit more color behind the rationale for the reserve build in
the quarter. I know you mentioned some of the ongoing uncertainty and the backdrop around stimulus. So just
curious, was there an overlay that you applied or are you seeing something specific there to justify the addition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Sure, John. I guess if you break down some of the components, the big driver obviously, is the
macroeconomic variables that you run through the model. And while they were modestly better, the out quarters
really haven't changed much from what we were looking at in the third quarter. So, those really drive the
magnitude of the allowance at its core. And so, there is really no change there. And then when you look
underneath, you see some growth in certain segments of the portfolio, so growth in the consumer book and some

growth in CRE. Much of the addition was for that. And then the other just reflects, the uncertainty, I guess, is the
way to put it or some conservatism in the forbearance portfolio and what that ultimately might look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, separately, on the credit front, can you give us an update on the
performance trends that you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio from a credit perspective? How are
you seeing your borrowers impacted amid the backdrop and are you seeing some stress there in terms of credit
performance? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, I guess, looking at the commercial real estate portfolio, the ones that we are most focused on right now
– the segments we're most focused on – are the hotel segment and the retail segment. And those are ones where
there has been significant amount of forbearance in those portfolios. And for the most part, those portfolios
received 180-day forbearance. And so, they will start to show themselves over the next 90 days. And the hotel
business continues to be challenged, particularly in some of the larger cities where you have a hotel that maybe
relies on conferences or food and beverage as part of their business. Those ones are probably the most
challenged. When you get into other segments of the hotel portfolio, where you're able to get there by car and
able to drive up, we've seen some return of revenue, not all the way back, obviously, to where things were, but
able to cash flow.
And so, we're watching those portfolios as we go through this quarter. But we're pleased by the reaction we've
seen from the customers so far and their ability to manage their expenses down to try and keep their cash flow at
least as close to breakeven as possible. We continue to feel very positive about the loan-to-values in the portfolio,
and that, in particular, in New York City, which I know gets a lot of attention, I think the average loan-to-value is
less than 50%. And when I look at in New York City, we have about $42 million of loans outstanding, which are
two loans that are between 60% and 70% LTV, and five loans in $152 million between 50% and 60%. And then,
the vast majority is less than 50% LTV. And so, when you look at those properties and the values, there's a lot
invested by the clients already in those properties and they have a real strong incentive to figure out how to
maintain it.
On the retail side, it's a similar space. I think retail has been a bit of a challenged industry much before COVID hit,
in that watching things going on line, we were seeing challenges on pricing and rents, and COVID just
accelerated that. But again, when we look at our portfolio and the distribution of the LTVs, again skews very low
and, in particular, in New York City skews also below 50%. And when we look at some of our larger relationships,
they have some LTVs where they're multigenerational ownership of properties and their cost basis, in some
cases, is down in the 25% of current values and the tax basis that they have is very low. So, they also have a very
vested interest in protecting those properties.
And so, it's long-winded way of saying there's certainly stress out there, but the clients have been active in
adjusting their operations to the environment. And then many of them have outside resources and liquidity to help
carry the properties, while things try and come back to normal. So, we'll know a little bit more in 90 days, but we're
very pleased by the actions that our clients have taken so far to protect their investments.

Hey. Good morning, Darren.

Darren J. King A

Good morning, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, the loans that you purchased out of the Ginnie Mae pools, what's the yield on those? And are you likely to
purchase again at a similar level in 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, in round numbers, the yield on those Ginnies is about 4%. Each one will be slightly different, but it's
right around there, plus or minus 5 basis points. And it's something that we will continue to do, just because it
makes economic sense to take some of these loans that are being serviced and buy them out so that we only
have the carry cost and we don't have to advance the principal and interest to the investors. But I think what you
saw in this quarter was a larger than what will be normal uptick in those balances because there was some
residual hangover from the second quarter where there hadn't been active buyouts happening. And so, the run
rate is probably more in like the $250 million to $300 million a month range, give or take, and it was just a larger
uptick this quarter because that hadn't happened very much in the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And I think you also said the purchase were late in the quarter, so we'll see the benefit flow
through into 4Q from this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. It continues through the quarter. There will be a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter, but not as big as
what we saw this quarter.

Analyst, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
My one question is on the contribution from the swap portfolio, heard you loud and clear in terms of the notional
stepping up to $17 billion. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense on what the contribution was to net
interest income from your derivative book in the fourth – sorry, in the third quarter. And how that progressed either
on an annual or quarterly basis, however you want to give it, in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, I think we talked last quarter about the hedging adding about 26 basis points to the net interest margin
for the quarter; was up slightly in the third quarter to about 30 basis points. And what you'll see going forward is,
as we mentioned earlier, as the notional goes up, but the coupon, the received fixed comes down, the impact's
about the same, we think, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. And then over time, as the start
of the swaps that become active have a lower coupon, the benefit will start to trickle down as we go through 2021.
And probably a good assumption would be like after you get through the second quarter, 3 basis points a quarter
decrease in the benefit of the hedge based on our forecast of what the balance sheet looks like.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I want to follow-up on expenses. The cost control has been very good this year and the guidance
for 4Q is in line with what you said three months ago, but how sustainable is the expense management? Is it kind
of just a one-time sort of pulling in on something? Is that – is all that sustainable? Is that kind of some structural
changes or a combination of two of them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Matt, it's a good question. I guess some of the things that I think are sustainable that you really see
illuminated in the third quarter results is if you look at the salaries and benefits and you compare them to where
they were in the third quarter of last year, you can see they're basically flat. They're up I think about $2 million. But
if you look at the other cost of operations, which is where the professional services shows up, you can see the
drop there. Now, some of the drop obviously is because there was impairment that we took in the third quarter of

last year that didn't repeat itself this year. But outside of that, you seen – we've seen a decrease in the
professional services line and we've been talking for a number of quarters about the path we've been on to build
technology skills and in-source those, which would impact the salary benefit line. And it took a while for the
professional services to come out. And so, you've seen that remixing. We've got a little bit more to do. And so, I
think there is some evidence that that is working and we can continue to do that, which I would say is more
structural.
A couple of the other big items obviously are travel and entertainment and advertising and promotion. I think, look,
we're seeing in the advertising and promotion line item is that, obviously, you need to be competitive in the
markets that you're advertising in. But also, we're learning that there is different ways that you can reach
customers and prospects that might be more cost-effective than traditional means. And so, we'll be continuing to
look at that as we go forward and being smarter about that, and also thinking a lot harder about how much travel
we need both internally, for sure, and then oftentimes with clients. I don't think you can get away from face-to-face
interactions in banking, but maybe we don't need quite as much as we've had in the past. So, we're looking at
how we're doing our business.
And I think the last thing you see is through the PPP process, we're able to handle such a massive amount of loan
volumes in a short period of time, I mean we literally did about three years' worth of SBA loans in a week, and we
did that through changing the process and using more digitization. And so, we think that there is opportunity to
take that thought process beyond just business loans into other lending and deposit opening, and other
operations to drive expenses down. And so, I guess, long story short, I think there's been some things that were
gifts, so to speak, from the pandemic, but it's also really got us to rethinking and continue on the path of rethinking
how we do the work. And that offers continuous improvement.
I don't know that there is a step change down, but we continue to chisel away, and I think that that would – allows
us to slow expense growth and to get close to positive operating leverage. I mean, to me to be in this environment
where we've had challenges in revenue and the efficiency ratio this quarter was the same as last year, I think, just
speaks to the ability of the team to be disciplined on expenses, which is kind of classic M&T.

Matthew Q
O'Connor
Analyst, Deutsche Bank

That's helpful. I'm going to guess you don't want to give explicit 2021 guidance on cost, but you just said no step
down, but also kind of described – an implication that it wouldn't be a step up as well. So if I had to guess, I would
think, seems like you're trying to keep costs relatively flat by parsing some of your comments together there.

Darren J. King A

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, Darren. Can I ask – how are you? Can I ask you further on the trust income. You said that the fee waivers
would be run rated I think going forward. Can you just help us understand what was in the third and what the step
up, if any, is going to be into the fourth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, I think we talked before about maybe $10 million a quarter impact from those fee waivers. And I think
this quarter we saw about $7 million and it was offset by an uptick in some of the loan agency fees that we get
because – you've been watching the debt markets, I think they hit a record for issuance at the end of September
and they still have three months to go. And so, that activity, our participation in that market you saw reflected in
some of the agency fees that show up in that trust income line. And so, it massed the impact of those fee waivers
on the money fund accounts. Also, we had – and continue to have strong equity markets and that's impacting
AUM positively, maybe a little better than we might have thought going into the quarter. And so, that also was a
positive that was an offset.
And so, the money fund waivers that we had talked about are basically in there. There might be a little bit more to
go. And then the question will be what happens with some of those other parts of the trust business and how
robust those markets are as we go through the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on mortgage, can you give a little bit more discussion of just the
differences between resi and commercial origination activity? And then also, are you still seeing opportunities to
buy additional servicing assets as you guys have been pretty frequent opportunistic buyers there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, I guess, most of the action for the last couple of quarters has really been in the consumer space. And
it's just with rates where they are there's a lot of refi activity going on, and so that's really what's been driving the
volume there. What I think has been seen for the last two quarters, both for us and for the industry, is that there
was so much volume, it overwhelmed people's capacity to handle it. And so, one of the ways the industry
manages capacity is through pricing. And so, that's why the margins were so strong this quarter and last. And so,
look, what do we expect to see in the fourth quarter is we expect to see similar levels of volume, maybe
seasonally slower just because of the fourth quarter. But we'll start to see the margins come down. We started to
see that at the end of the last quarter that the gain-on-sale margin in September was down from what it was in

July and August. And so, we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter and that's why we think we'll see
a drop in the mortgage fee line item.
In commercial, things have been slow really since COVID hit. There's just not a lot of activity in the commercial
real estate space. Third quarter, I think, for the last couple of years has been a blowout quarter for us in the
commercial real estate sector. This year was the notable exception and we don't see that changing into the fourth
quarter. It's just a slowdown in activity there.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities
LLC
Hey, guys. I wanted to parse through some of the moving parts on net interest income. So, I think in the response
to Erika's question, you mentioned, Darren, that the protection from the hedges gate were about 30 bps which by
my calculations amount to roughly $95 million. Just to clarify then, your guidance for NII in the fourth quarter, that
assumes that that level of protection more or less stays flat, i.e., there's no incremental benefit? And you're also
assuming no PPP forgiveness in that outlook, is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just following up there, you kind of painted a picture on the outlook into 2021 for the benefit sort
of trickling down gradually especially in the latter part of the year. But your disclosure show that your – I think the
average – weighted average maturity is about 1.3 years on the swap of where it was at in the second quarter,
which would seem to imply that there would be some more material step down in protection at some point
between now and, say, year-end 2022. I mean, I guess, how should we read that and think about that? Is there
going to be more of a cliff effect on the hedge protection that you get late next year into 2022? Just maybe a little
bit more color in terms of how that evolved, not just during the course of 2021, but looking out over the life of
those hedges.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I guess, so when you think about the hedging that we did and the way we constructed the portfolio, we
were always adding a consistent level, with the exception obviously of this next 12 months, of forward starting
14

swaps. And so, the idea was to keep the outstanding notional amount fairly consistent through time. And really
what starts to happen is each month, one swap falls off and a new one starts, and it would be reflective of the rate
environment at the time at which we entered into that agreement.
And so, we're in the spot now where we're entering these agreements and the curve was positively sloping and
rates were higher. And over time, you saw those received fixed coupons come down. And so, there's not really a
cliff, per se, but more a continual gradual decline as each month some swaps go inactive and forward starting
ones become active, and that brings the average received fixed coupon that's in place in any month declining
through 2021 and into 2022.
And then as the duration of the swap portfolio will shorten because the rates really fell down at the end of 2019
and then at the start of 2020, there wasn't a benefit that we saw in continuing to add forward starting swaps to
lock in rates at 50 or 25 basis points, now that we continue to believe that zero is, for all intents and purposes, the
practical floor right now and that negative rates are not a huge consideration of the Fed. And so, we've slowed
down in the hedging and that you'll see that it gradually goes away through the next 24 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald J. MacLeod A
Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary & Director-Investor Relations, M&T Bank Corp.
Just a point of clarification, the weighted average maturity is not from the reporting date, but from the start date of
the forward starting swap to the end of the forward starting swap.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, it's not 1.3 years necessarily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald J. MacLeod A
Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary & Director-Investor Relations, M&T Bank Corp.
From now, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, from now, okay. It's from when they – all the forward starting swaps come on board. Okay.
I guess the second, let me just pivot quickly to second question. The CRE book, 180 days forbearance, I think you
mentioned $5.1 billion and two-thirds of that, I guess, exiting the initial deferral period. So, a couple of questions
there, do you have any expectations as to what percentage of that will ask for second modification? And how do
you expect to account for additional modification? Do you anticipate taking advantage of the CARES Act, the
4013, to not classify it as a TDR or will you say these loans have been in modification for an extended period and
hence we think they should be treated as TDR even with some of the, I guess, the negative implications for risk-
weighted assets and other things? I'm just curious what you're expecting there and how you plan to account for it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, I guess, a couple of things. Obviously, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with each of these
portfolios as we go. But I look at what we've seen so far. And so, I mentioned that the C&I portfolio was going to
be down to about $800 million of loans still in forbearance. The bulk of that is really folks who haven't reached the
end of their current term.

When I look at the dealers and the floor plan dealers that were in forbearance, I mean, basically, 98% of them
have gone back to paying. When I look at the rest of the C&I portfolio, it's about 90% have gone back to paying.
And there has been some decrease in the commercial real estate portfolio levels of forbearance. And when I look
at folks who have come up for – or to the end of their time period so far – about 80% of them have gone back on
to their normal payment schedule. And so, from what we've seen so far, about 20% have gone back or have
asked for some extension of their forbearance.
When we get into the next group that will come up, I think it's a tougher segment. And so, I'm not sure I'm bold
enough to say it will be 20%. But the trends that we've seen are positive and we know that there are a number of
clients that we've talked to that do actually plan to resume payments because they have outside liquidity and the
wherewithal to go back and maintaining their loans.
As it relates to how they'll be handled, I mean each loan and each client will be treated individually and
considered individually and we'll look at, first of all, are they looking for some kind of change to their terms; and if
they are, are we getting anything back. We might be able to get an interest reserve, we might be able to get a little
bit of equity, we might get a different rate. And so, the combination of those things will help us go through our
determination of whether we think it qualifies as a TDR or needs to go on nonaccrual. But I think it's safe to say
that there will be an uptick in those categories as we go into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
While we've seen some improvement in metrics like unemployment and GDP, and your outlook there is helpful,
but some of the CRE metrics have been going the other way, can you give us a little bit more color on what your
outlook is contemplating for some of those key drivers for CRE metric performance? Some of the industry
forecasts have metrics like vacancy rates continuing to rise and commercial real estate prices continuing to
decline as we look out to 2021. I understand that shouldn't have an impact on your CECL allowance as long as it
contemplates that degradation. But it would be helpful to understand a bit better what your expectations are, if
possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, I guess one of the most important parts of this is understanding not just what's going on, but how the loan
was underwritten to start. And so, when you look at a lot of our real estate portfolio, and I'll speak to multifamily,
we take into account the current rents and we don't assume the rent increases when we underwrite. We take into
account the current vacancy, but we underwrite to a higher level of vacancies than what exists. And another really
important element is just the interest rates. And that as the interest rates drop, that creates a lot of capacity to
support these properties.
And so, a lot of – those factors will also help maintain collateral values. And so, we've seen vacancy pick up. One
of the places, obviously, we watch a lot is in New York City and we've seen rent collections in the 90% to 95%
range. So, we feel pretty good about that. There hasn't really been much to straight it in terms of values to think
about Commercial Real Estate Price Index, which the CREPI would be an important element in the CECL
modeling. So, we haven't seen much there.
So, those factors, rent changes, we would look at and look at the vacancy rate and the realizable rent as we
forecast cash flows for each of these individual borrowers and think through whether or not they're running at a
deficit or not are they able to adjust their expense base, and then what outside resources they have to maybe
come in and maintain the properties. And there'd be a similar viewpoint on the hotel portfolio, obviously, slightly
different where you're looking at RevPAR and you're looking at occupancy rates.
And again, we've seen – and it depends on the geography – some uptick. New York has been a little bit more of a
challenge, but we see that in office. Also, so far, rent collections are holding up and strong, and people are going
back into the city. At least you're hearing announcements, particularly from the tech sector, of space being under
contract.
And so, I guess, little bit of a long-winded answer to say that when we look at the trends in these portfolios, we're
not seeing a severe degradation; it's gradual. And what we've watched so far, we've seen the clients doing very
good job of adjusting their business to be able to manage their cash flow. And where they don't do that, they often

have the outside liquidity to be able to maintain the property. And I guess the question really is, how much liquidity
do they have and how long can they sustain it in this environment?

Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Beyond the hedging benefits that you've discussed, can you give a bit more color on the loan and securities
portfolio pay-downs on your back book, perhaps, by product if possible? What's the yield differential between
what's paying down and what you're deploying into today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess when you look at the – I'll take the loan book separate from the securities book. On the securities book,
we basically run it for not a lot of duration risk and certainly not a lot of credit risk, and it's – we describe it as a
barbell where there has been a significant amount invested in when your treasuries are less and then another
significant amount in mortgage-backed securities. And with the mortgage-backed securities, as they pay down,
we haven't been buying additional securities at this point just given where rates are. And those dollars are
basically going into cash. And so, that's part of the cash build.
Interesting, when you look at the loan portfolios, what we've seen in the last 90 days and probably started a little
bit earlier is that the margins on new business have been increasing. And so, when we look at the returns that are
being generated on new loans over the last 120 days, they're higher than what's in the book. And so, between
floors going into the loans, where the floors are actually active the day the loan starts and some firming in the
pricing, we're actually starting to see roll-on margins higher than roll-off margins in the loan book. And so, when
you get – it will take a little while for that to start to shift the whole portfolio, but as you get out into 2022 and
beyond, you start to see a greater proportion of that benefit in the loan yields and the loan margin. And so, it's
encouraging to see where things are heading at least based on the last 90 days.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I'm good, I'm good. Hey, real quick on the fee income, you talked about the deposits service charges snapping
back nicely in the quarter. When I look at the other revenues from operations, I mean can you give us a little color
on what's going on in there, because it feels like the overall level is sort of back to pre-COVID if you get rid of the
Bayview from the first quarter? I don't know, was there anything in there when you look at BOLI or the discount,
merchant discount, any of the insurance revenues, or is there anything in there that you can give us color to that –
is that $107 million somewhat run-ratable into the fourth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, sure Brian. By and large, when you look through the components in that category, we have seen a strong
snapback in merchant discount and credit cards. They're pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. BOLI was pretty
consistent as was some of the underwriting. Loan fees were up quarter-over-quarter, but not back to pre-COVID
level. And obviously, that's a function of what's going on with the activity in the market. And then, sometimes in
that line item, there is some lumpiness of things that happen. And we were, I guess on that line item, close to
where we average. I've seen some quarters where it's $20 million higher than what we had before and last
quarter was particularly low. So, it might be a little bit high from where we might run rate in the fourth quarter. But
there's still some spots where there's softness – some softness in insurance and some softness still on some of
the fees. We're not quite all the way back to pre-COVID levels on loan fees and merchant card.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And just quick follow up, same question on the other side, the other miscellaneous costs, looks like
they were down a little bit, lower than the run rate over the last few quarters. And usually the fourth quarter has
like the professional services or the accountant accruals and stuff like that that might be in there, so should we
expect that one to be kind of back up to sort of average levels versus the $165 million within the third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I think that the spot we're at now is probably pretty reasonable for where we are in the fourth quarter. And barring
– the only other thing that goes through there that creates some lumpiness is there has been litigation costs or
MSR impairment, or when we took the write down on the asset manager that we sold, that goes through that line
item. So, kind of holding that stuff aside, I think we are, give or take, a few million bucks in the right zone of where
that will be for the fourth quarter.

Hi, Darren.

Good morning, Gerard. How are you doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good. Thank you for taking the question. To wrap up, can you give us a comment on what you're thinking about
for next year on capital action plans? Obviously, the fed has suspended buybacks for all the banks like your size.
But what are you guys thinking should the gate get lifted? And second, if it's not lifted until let's say the third or
fourth quarter of next year and your capital really is starting to accumulate, is a Dutch auction tender offer a
consideration to bring in to get all the stock at once?

So, I guess, the first part of – I'll leave the Dutch auction thing for a second, I haven't really thought much about a
Dutch auction, to be honest with you. I appreciate it, you've always got great questions. On deployment of capital,
we'll obviously have to wait and see what comes from the Fed through the resubmission process that we're all
going through right now and if the Fed actually allows the SCB framework to be effective. But generally, our
thought process on capital deployment really isn't changing, and that the first place we want to deploy capital is in
the service of our customers and the communities that we do business in.
And we've got the liquidity, as you can clearly see on the balance sheet, and we keep generating the capital so
that we're in a position to be able to lend and support growth in the communities. And so, hopefully, we'll see
some of that. And as I mentioned before, I really like the returns that I'm seeing on some of the businesses right
now. After that, we'll obviously hope that we're maintaining our income and so we can maintain the dividend. And
then we'll look at what other alternatives we have to deploy the capital.
To me the most important thing is we'll try and return it, if we got excess and we're allowed to. But really the key
of how we've always run the bank is to make sure that we don't take the capital that we believe to be excess and
consider it free. If we sit on the capital, it's inefficient and we'd certainly rather not do that. But investing it in low
return businesses or low return loans, then you're stuck in that position and that lowers your overall returns for the
organization. You're stuck with that for the length of that asset. And so, we do that from time to time to win new
prospects and customers. But we wouldn't want to make a practice out of deploying capital into low return
businesses. And so, we'll see what the alternatives are, but we'll continue to manage it the way we always have,
which is to be thoughtful stewards of capital and make sure we're focused on returns.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020

And then just as a follow-up question, clearly you and your peers have indicated that many of your customers
have built up their liquidity in their deposit accounts because of these uncertain times. Can you compare this to
the 2008-2009 time period, because we had the same phenomenon of customers building up liquidity? How long
did it take, do you recall, to have those customers bring those deposits down to a more normal level? And what
do you see for this cycle? Is it going to be as long as it was at the 2008-2009?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, my crystal ball is as good as yours, Gerard. But I guess, I look at the level of liquidity that we have this time,
I think people are smarter this time than they were last time. I think the industry, not the banking industry, per se,
but the customers we bank have been a lot quicker to build liquidity, have been a lot quicker to adjust their
business operations to the revenue environment. And that's why we've seen that build up.
I think part of what you're seeing in the liquidity also is the lack of alternatives of places where they can invest
their excess cash, right. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to have it in sweep right now, if you're a larger middle
market client; doesn't make sense to keep it in time and money market accounts, if you're a small business or a
consumer because there is no rate there. And so, we're seeing it all sit liquid. And what I think starts to happen is,
as things improve, you'll see some of it get deployed in hiring, in building inventory. And you'll see some of it get
deployed into higher-returning asset classes from the customer's perspective, to the extent that they've got
excess.
And how long that takes I think will be some combination of how quickly we see GDP recover and how quickly we
see interest rate movement up from here. I guess I'd just keep in mind that last time it took us until we probably
got to 75 or 100 basis points on Fed funds before people started to really move and pay attention to moving
dollars out of savings and tie our savings and interest checking and checking into higher-yielding types of
products. So, I think we're thinking it's here for a while, kind of next 12 months, hopefully not much longer, but
we'll see how the economy goes.
