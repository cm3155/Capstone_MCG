Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone. I hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy.
While we are pleased with our first quarter core fundamental trends and the implementation of the ONB Way
strategic initiatives, our commitment and focus today is on supporting our clients, team members and

communities. I'd also like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients and
communities during this difficult time.
Starting on slide 3, our first quarter net income was $22.6 million including $31.2 million in ONB Way charges.
Adjusted net income was higher at $42.1 million which includes higher loan loss provisions for the first quarter
adoption of CECL.
As you review our results, you'll see that our core margin was down due to the Fed fund rate cuts and the
challenging yield curve. We were able to lower total deposit costs by 9 basis points to 34 basis points. Our
commercial production of $647 million was seasonally higher.
As a result of the good production, lower payoffs and some higher quality line usage, commercial loans grew over
13% annualized. We recorded $17 million in provision expense during the quarter related to the adoption of
CECL. I suspect you will see wide variances in CECL provisions this quarter for mid-sized banks as we all
adapted to this new standard and the multiple economic forecasts. Once we determined the accounting relief from
CECL was very temporary and the regulatory capital relief was extended, it made sense for us to proceed with
adopting as of January 1.
The depth of this crisis is yet to be known. I won't even speculate on future losses or provision needs, but the
impact is clearly very broad based. The Midwest having felt the same impact as other parts of the country, and we
are hopeful that relief programs we have put in place coupled with the various governmental programs will
ultimately blunt the economic impact to our clients.
Old National is celebrating our 186 year in business. As you know, we pride ourselves on being a basic, boring
bank. Our loan portfolio is diverse. It's granular and overall is strong that's ever been heading into this crisis. But
we will need more time to better understand the magnitude of the economic impacts before truly understanding
future losses.
We have run and shared with our board of directors multiple economic forecasts and various stress tests. As a
result, we are still open for business and extending new credit. We manage for the long term. Our balance sheet
and capital are strong, our markets are diverse and our experienced team will help manage us through this
challenging time. I am confident that we will emerge even stronger on the other side.
We were successful in making the organizational changes we revealed last quarter and we made significant
progress on the efficiency initiatives under the ONB Way. Brendon will provide all the details, but we are on track
to deliver $22 million in cost savings in 2020 and achieve the full $40 million run rate in 2021 as we discussed on
last quarter's call. We continue to make progress on the revenue initiatives, but admittedly, some of them have
been reprioritized given the pressing need for investments in the various government relief programs and our own
internal relief programs.
On the capital front, we did repurchase 4.9 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $16.05. We did
suspend our program given the uncertain economic conditions. After reviewing the various stress tests with our
board, we don't anticipate any other capital actions, and we expect to maintain our current dividend.
Moving to slide 4, we detailed our COVID-19 response for clients, team members, and communities. The health
and safety of our team members and clients is paramount. We granted additional sick time for team members
along with additional paid time-off for all team members to assist with unforeseen personal needs. We also
expanded family and medical leave benefits to those who are at-risk or would have an at-risk person in their

household. We've enabled many team members to work remotely. Daily we have more than 1,000 team members
working from home. And lastly, we expanded our ONe Wish program for team members with unforeseen financial
needs. All our branches are open via drive-thru with lobbies by appointment only. We provided information on
digital banking options and change in our service delivery model via oldnational.com, e-mails, direct mail, and
social media platforms.
We've definitely seen healthy increases on our mobile and online platforms. We are providing clients relief by
approving payment extensions, not reporting payment deferrals to credit bureaus and waving or refunding
overdraft and monthly service charges for clients impacted by COVID-19.
We continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes. We've helped
nearly 5,200 clients with the SBA Payment Protection Program and we are proactively reaching out to our clients
in approving loan payment extensions.
Today, I'm pleased that we announced a $1.2 million commitment to immediate and near-term relief efforts,
600,000 for immediate needs with an emphasis on low-to-moderate income communities and 600,000 for our
Foundation with a focus on long-term restoration.
As you can see on slide 5, the COVID-19 impact to the states in our footprint has been less impactful than other
parts of the country. Michigan has some of the highest reported case in our footprint with almost 80%
concentrated in the [audio gap] (07:03) where we have no branches.
In our footprint, business and governmental leaders are talking about safe ways to open businesses and return to
work. I'm optimistic that the Midwest will be among the earliest to reopen. Scott Evernham, our Chief Risk Officer,
and Daryl Moore, our Chief Credit Executives, are joining us on the call today. Both are experienced in their roles
and have many of the same leaders in their teams for the 2008 financial crisis.
We are fortunate to have Daryl's experience in this environment given he's been with Old National for more than
40 years. He was really hoping to finish his career by never having to present slides in our earnings conference
call again, but I'm glad to have his experience today, and I will now turn the call over to Daryl.

Daryl D. Moore
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Jim. Slide 6 gives us a high level of review of the composition of both our commercial and consumer
portfolios. While there's no denying that most industry segments have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19
outbreak, we've outlined in the top chart for you the commercial industries that many believe will suffer
disproportionately in this crisis.
Over the years, we've tried to identify those industry segments that are most volatile and do not perform well in a
cycle, and for the most part have attempted to either not participate in those segments or participated with
appropriate structure and risk mitigation in place. We certainly will not be immune to difficulties in these segments,
but as you can see, the size of our exposure to these most vulnerable industries appears to be well managed
going into the cycle.
With respect to our consumer loan book, you can see in the chart in the bottom-left quadrant of the slide, a
breakout of the size and average FICO scores of the different product types within our consumer portfolio going
into the cycle. There's no doubt that because of the significant increase in unemployment, we will experience
difficulties in this portfolio that none of us would have anticipated when we originated these loans. But again,

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
looking at the FICO scores and the fact that less than 2.5% of the portfolio could be considered subprime, we
believe that we are fairly well positioned to address any developing difficulties in this portfolio.
Just a couple of comments about line utilization. As reflected on the chart in the lower right-hand quadrant, we
have seen an increase in commercial line utilization predominantly from clients with stronger asset quality ratings.
Commercial line utilization at March 31 was 35.2% compared to 32.6% at the end of the prior quarter. We've also
seen an increase in HELOC applications within the last 45 days with the quality of those applications generally
being very strong. While we are not able to definitively determine why we are seeing an uptick in this particular
loan category, we suspect that many of our consumer borrowers are following the lead of our commercial clients
[ph] line of (09:43) liquidity backup if the economy continues to be stressed for a more lengthy time period.
Next, we wanted to give you an idea of the volume of the loan deferral approvals we have granted and have laid
out those along with some Paycheck Protection Program information on slide 7.
On the commercial side, we have approved roughly 900 requests from borrowers totaling $1.1 billion representing
14% of total commercial outstandings. While 62% of the deferrals we have booked to-date are in the CRE loan
category, we expect to see this percentage drop as we continue to book approved requests as proportion of CRE
requests appears to have been higher early on in the deferral application process. As you might suspect, while
the number of loan deferrals is higher in the consumer area, the dollar amount of those deferrals and the portfolio
penetration numbers are lower than in the commercial area.
As shown on the right-hand side of the slide, through the exhaustive work of many of our team members, we have
helped provide $1.3 billion in Paycheck Protection Program assistance to roughly 5,200 borrowers.
Slide 8 provides a recap of credit trends from the first quarter results. Both non-performing and underperforming
loans fell slightly in the quarter to levels lower than we have posted at any quarter end in 2019 and lower than any
year-end level in the past three years. Charge-offs were higher in the quarter related to two particular credits. We
chose to take an additional write-down prior to the end of the quarter on a relationship that was the subject of our
larger 2019 fourth quarter charge-off. Being concerned about collateral values in this new economic environment,
we commissioned new appraisals and felt an additional write-down of $2.1 million was appropriate.
The other larger charge-off in the quarter was a $3.8 million action on a credit we have been working with for an
extended time period waiting on the investment of outside capital that have been promised by the borrower. As
we were not entirely certain that this capital investment would be made, we chose to fully impair the loan for loan
loss reserve purposes back in 2019. When it became apparent that the investment would not materialize by the
end of the quarter and given the change in the economy, we determined that a complete write-off of the exposure
was appropriate. We will continue to pursue collection efforts on this relationship going forward. At this point in
time, we do not feel these write-downs are reflective of any general pre-COVID-19 credit issues in the portfolio but
represents isolated credit events that occur over time in any portfolio.
Just a couple of comments before I end my part of this discussion about our approach to this newly changing
environment. Over the years, we've dealt with numerous economic cycles. It has become apparent that an
intentional clearly communicated plan with respect to how we will approach the challenge at hand is important to
minimizing losses.
What we have found is the first item at hand is for everyone to recognize that economic conditions have changed.
In this current environment, the pace and the breadth of this change is unparalleled. While this sounds obvious
and simple to accomplish, we have to remember that just 60 days ago most banks were in full new loan

production mode getting team members to switch for production [indiscernible] (12:50) when necessary, having
tough conversations with clients about the new economic realities is vitally important and has to be accomplished
quickly for the benefit of both the client and the bank.
In this new environment, we are emphasizing at minimum we must evaluate the borrower's liquidity, capital
adequacy and availability and loan structure every time we touch a credit. Liquidity is the first concern of the bank
and most borrowers in such times as these without the ability to continue to fund the basic necessities of the
business and otherwise resourceful enterprise can't survive.
What is different about this downturn is the infusion of liquidity that the government is making through the
Paycheck Protection Program and other offerings. While we are hopeful is yet to be seen whether the amounts
our borrowers are able to draw under these programs are going to be at levels sufficient to bridge them through
this challenge.
The adequacy and availability of the capital is the next concern we talk with our borrowers about to remember that
– or to remind them that capital is a reserve that they have to cover unanticipated setbacks. If we do not believe
that our borrowers have sufficient balance sheet capital to get them through the current setbacks, we challenge
them as to what outside resources they may have at their disposal to raise needed capital and encourage them to
begin to line up those resources.
As a final point, we require a review of the current loan structure and collateral support. We are emphasizing that
opportunities to strengthen structures in terms of guarantees and covenants must be considered and the
acquisition of additional collateral, if available, has to be on the table in our discussion with our borrowers. We're
also beginning to think about how the current challenges of shelter in place might have an impact on collateral
values and ultimately loss given default assumptions.
Foreclosures have been put on hold, auto auction houses are not currently in operation in many locations, courts
are closed, and I could go on. It's a time proven fact that in most instances, collateral does not get more valuable
with the passage of time in an economic downturn. Our collateral values and liquidation strategies play out has
yet to be seen, given the pent-up demand may play a role in softening the risk associated with this potential issue.
I outlined these fairly obvious items because I believe that a bank's discipline around these very basic
fundamentals can make a difference to the ultimate performance of its portfolios.
Finally, I think it's important to reaffirm that the bank embraces the vital role it needs to play in supporting each of
our communities' recovery efforts. While focusing on the basic credit fundamentals I've addressed is critically
important in this environment, we also understand our obligation to provide credit at every responsible opportunity
to help our clients and this country to get back on our feet. My belief is that banks that understand how to properly
balance these two imperatives will have every opportunity to be very successful as we come out of the cycle.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendon.

Thank you, Daryl. Before turning to the quarterly financials, we would like to provide some additional color on our
CECL allowance on slide 9. Our Day 1 CECL reserve of $96 million was $41.3 million over our year-end reserve
and right in the middle of our projected range. The relatively large [indiscernible] (15:55) increase in reserves and
$17 million provision expense for the quarter were primarily driven by projected economic impact of the
coronavirus. The macroeconomic variables used in our models were derived in the Moody's Critical Pandemic

Forecast Scenario published on March 20. The scenario assumes a sharp decline in GDP in Q2 and a return to
growth by year-end.
The immediate increase in unemployment is less severe than current expectations but does remain elevated
through 2023. The slide also outlines the key economic variables and portfolio inputs used in our models. In
addition to the quantitative inputs, we also considered several qualitative factors in our final reserve assessment,
including the risk that the economic decline, specifically unemployment and GDP, prove to be more severe and/or
prolonged than our baseline forecast. We also took into consideration the mitigating impact of the unprecedented
fiscal stimulus, including direct payments individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, as well as various
government sponsored loan programs, which we expect will provide relief to consumer and commercial
borrowers.
Lastly, as Daryl reviewed, we consider a relatively low exposure to the industries expected to be most vulnerable
to this crisis.
The future severity of the economic fallout from this virus is yet unknown, as is the ultimate effectiveness of the
government response in providing a bridge for the individuals and businesses impacted. As time goes on, we will
have more clarity on both and we'll adjust our reserve levels accordingly. That said, we believe our current
reserve level reflects our best estimate of the credit losses in the portfolio today.
Turning to the quarter on slide 10. Our GAAP earnings per share was $0.13 and our adjusted earnings per share
was $0.25. Adjusted earnings per share excluded $31.2 million in ONB Way related charges as well as $5.2
million in debt securities gains.
Moving to slide 11, our quarterly adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue was 3% higher year-over-year and
5% higher over prior quarter. This result was driven by increased fee income led by our mortgage and capital
markets businesses as well as a reduction in adjusted operating expenses resulting from our progress towards
achieving the expected savings from ONB Way initiative.
Despite the challenging operating environment, we improved operating leverage by 102 basis points year-over-
year. We believe our strong pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue will provide a buffer against future provision needs.
Slide 12 shows the trend in outstanding loans. End of period loans increased $274 million quarter-over-quarter
largely in our commercial and commercial real estate loan categories. The increase was driven by solid
commercial loan reduction of $647 million, slowing prepayment speeds and higher line utilization. The 2.6%
increase in line utilization was concentrated in our highest credit quality borrowers.
Commercial activity was high during the first quarter which resulted in a sizable increase in our pipeline, which
currently stands at $2.7 billion. But given the current economic uncertainty, we would expect pull through rates to
be lower than recent quarters. The full impact of the December rate cut on existing loans coupled with lower
coupons on new production drove overall portfolio yields lower. We expect a dramatic shift in the yield curve will
continue to put pressure on asset yields in 2020.
Moving to slide 13, both period and end average deposits decreased during the quarter due to seasonal declines
in public fund operating accounts and modest CD runoff. Our total cost deposits declined 9 basis points quarter-
over-quarter to 34 basis points. We quickly reacted to the emergency rate cuts in March and ended the month at
a very low 21 basis points in total deposit costs. Time deposits rate averaged 1.34% during the quarter, but with
approximately three quarters of our CD book maturing in the next 12 months, our interest expense should

continue to decline. We are pleased with the results of our deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a
meaningful reduction in deposit costs, while maintaining our core client base.
Slide 14 shows our first quarter earning asset mix and quarter-over-quarter change in loan mix. Strong
commercial loan growth this quarter supports our goal of remixing our balance sheet to more productive
commercial and commercial real estate loans. The investment portfolio yield was down just 3 basis points quarter-
over-quarter to 2.71% with new purchases yield in 2.42%.
Next on slide 15, you'll see the detailed changes in our first quarter net interest income and corresponding margin.
Strong earning asset growth contributed to our net interest income and we are pleased with the performance of
the margins given the challenges of the interest rate environment. Net interest margin excluding accretion was
slightly lower than our expectations at 3.16% compared to 3.25% last quarter. However, adjusting for the day
impact and lower interest collected on nonaccrual loans, core margin was down just 2 basis points. The reduction
in core earning asset yields which were down 10 basis points was nearly offset by reductions in our funding cost.
Active repricing of our deposit book and balance sheet strategies continue to help mitigate the negative impact on
margin.
Slide 16 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Our first quarter adjusted noninterest income increased $5
million, the quarter-over-quarter change was a result of an increase in mortgage banking revenue which was
driven by strong production and healthy gain on sale margins but also benefited from a $4.8 million change in our
pipeline valuation.
We did take a $1.5 million impairment charge to our MSR portfolio this quarter that is netted against our mortgage
revenue. The capital markets line of business continues to be a bright spot as interest rate swaps continue to be
very attractive to clients. Other key categories were generally stable but will likely come under pressure in the
second quarter. Also included on this slide is a summary of our mortgage activities for the quarter, which shows
$361 million in production. Low interest rates continued to support strong refi activity in the quarter, which
accounted for 48% of our production.
Next, slide 17 shows a trend in adjusted noninterest expenses, which reflects our ongoing focus on expense
management. Onetime charges were $31.2 million this quarter, which is slightly better than the $34 million we
projected. Adjusting for these onetime charges and tax credit amortization, noninterest expense was down almost
$3.6 million quarter-over-quarter and we remain on track to realize the expected savings from our ONB Way
strategic plan.
It's also worth noting that our Q1 noninterest expense included a CECL-related day 2 adjustment to our allowance
for unfunded commitments of $1.7 million. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter is a low 59.3%,
representing 166 basis point improvement over Q4 of 2019.
As I wrap up my discussion on the quarter, here are some key takeaways. We are pleased with our overall
performance as the fundamentals of our core business were strong as demonstrated by our improved pre-tax pre-
provision net revenue. We posted 9% annualized loan growth in the quarter without compromising on credit. We
defended the margin well in an increasingly challenging rate environment. Our fee businesses posted healthy
revenue growth particularly in mortgage and capital markets. And we delivered on the promised expense savings
we outlined last quarter.
Slide 18 includes our thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. The COVID-19 virus will have a
meaningful impact on our 2020 performance. Commercial loan activity was strong in the quarter and we entered

the second quarter with a healthy pipeline. However, near-term economic uncertainty is expected to have a
negative impact on pull through rates and may mute future loan growth. PPP loans are expected to add $1.35
billion to our outstandings in Q2, but there are some uncertainty about how long these loans will stay on our
balance sheet.
We have meaningfully mitigated the impact on our net interest margins to the short end of the curve, but
historically low long-term rates will continue to put pressure on asset yields as our loan and investment portfolio is
repriced at lower coupons. After repricing, our deposit book has been a key component of our margin defense.
And while there is room to move deposit costs lower particularly within the CD portfolio, most of the transaction
account rate reductions are now behind us.
PPP loans will also impact our margin going forward. These loans carry a 1% coupon and an average fee of
approximately 3% that will be accreted through margin on a level yield over their two-year terms. As loans are
paid off early, any remaining fees will be accreted to income immediately.
Several fee items will also likely come under pressure from the economic slowdown. Our wealth management and
investment businesses have seen a decline in the valuation of our assets under management that will impact fees
in the near term. Overdraft fees and interchange income were down sharply in the last week of March, as
consumers began to comply with shelter in place orders and limited their spending to essential services. Although
we've seen a pickup in activity in early April, we're likely to stay below trend until the economy is reopened.
As I mentioned earlier, the mortgage pipeline ended at record highs, we can see – but we could see increased
fallout in the weeks to come. A large driver of the mortgage revenue this quarter was related to our pipeline build.
That revenue typically reverses in the fourth quarter as pipelines decline. But given the disruption in the housing
market, it may reverse more quickly.
We expect the remainder of 2020 to reflect the expense reductions associated with ONB Way that were
communicated last quarter, net of merit increases beginning in Q2. We are now estimating total onetime charges
in 2020 related to ONB Way to be $39 million, which is a decrease from the original estimate of $42 million. All of
our expense initiative remained on track including the planned closure of 31 branches by April 24.
We'd also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook. We ended the quarter with a
healthy CET1 ratio of 11.4%. And in abundance of caution, we have suspended our buyback program temporarily
with any future use of the authorization dependent on the facts and circumstances present later in the year. I
would also reiterate that based on our current capital levels and our outlook on 2020 performance, we believe we
have the capacity to maintain our dividend.
We've also recently updated our stress test model, and under the CCAR severely adverse scenario, we remain
well capitalized at the lowest point in the nine-quarter horizon. Our liquidity position also remains very strong with
our low loan-to-deposit ratio of 87%, strong cash and unencumbered security position and various other sources
of liquidity, we have plenty of flexibility to respond to funding needs.
Lastly, we provided some guidance on our full year 2020 tax rate, which is expected to be approximately 19.5%
on an FTE basis and 14.5% on a GAAP basis. The effective tax rate includes $6 million in tax credits primarily
related to the historic tax credit project, which was placed in service in Q1.
This project generated the majority of the $5.5 million in tax credit amortization included in our operating
expenses this quarter. Project delays caused by COVID-19 have impacted the timing of our other historic tax

credit projects that were included in our last quarter estimates. Please remove any additional tax credit
amortization you have in your model other than the actual amount from Q1.
We will update you next quarter regarding the timing of the remaining projects. As a reminder, the tax credit
amortization is recognized through expenses in the quarter that corresponds with the placed in service date, while
the tax benefit is spread over the full year through the tax line.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
We are. We are. Thank you very much for asking. Appreciate you taking the questions. First ones that I wanted to
ask were just on credit. So, first, maybe just sort of a second on the 86 basis point reserve to loan ratio and
basically what that means in a CECL world. Maybe just kind of a refresher there just in terms of adequacy. And
then you noted that you guys had updated your stress scenario and still remain well capitalized even at the low
point. Just curious how the existing reserve compares to what you guys might consider sort of stress losses in
that scenario you used.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Sure, Scott. I'll start off and Daryl can chime in. So, just as a reminder, so we started the reserve at $55
million at year-end. We're now sitting at $106 million and the [ph] $67 million of marked (29:10) still remains
outstanding on those loans.
As far as the stress test is concerned, so we ran the most recent portfolio through our stress test models and
come out with cumulative net charge-offs that are roughly in line with Great Recession totals in that 2.5% to 3%
range. So, that would be the right comparable to our 86 basis points [indiscernible] (29:33).

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, I had another question on the PPP loans, maybe just to – I guess, a little bit
of almost tutorial on how you plan to account for them in addition to what you put in the guidance slide. So, first of
all, those – everything that you guys have approved, that actually gets funded, right, based on what you guys
have in the outlook. And then, the origination fees, those – it looks like, well, all flow through the margin as well.
So, I guess, we could see it kind of be – PPP be dilutive to the margin here in the immediate term. But presuming
they are forgiven as planned, then, you would sort of accelerate, so you'd get a bump-up in the margin as they
pay off. Is that the right way to think about it?

Good morning, Chris.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to Scott's question on the PPP loans, I think a lot of the
programs are much shorter than I think the two years that you laid out on the slide. For modeling purposes, I
mean we bump up the loan growth in the second quarter by the amount of $1.3 billion. My sense is most of that
will come – kind of unwind over the next six months. Is that a reasonable base case with...

That's our expectation too, Chris. But initially, you have to set these things up to amortize the life of the loans. So,
if they're all forgiven within Q2 then you'd see a bump there. But if it does – if they're not forgiven until Q3, it would
be dilutive to the margin in Q2.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Chris, I would just add, there's still a lot of details to be determined about how we verify compliance with the
forgiveness rules that are – that are yet to even be written or published. So, it could take a couple of quarters for
this to kind of all unwind. I think we're all hopeful it unwinds quickly, but the reality is since we don't know rules to
play by, it's going to be difficult to determine exactly how fast these loans are going to get forgiven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the expectation is to either fund them with the balance sheet flexibility you have with loan-to-
deposit or through some of the government programs that [indiscernible] (32:03)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We're actively plan to participate with the Federal Reserve's – Treasury Department's program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate that. Just one more. I'm trying to map slide 6 and 7, the deferrals and the vulnerable industries.
I think in your prepared remarks you talked about CRE being a big piece of the deferrals. Any color on maybe the
restaurant book or some of the other portfolios that might be – you might be working with in terms of trying to
extend some terms for your stressed clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Chris, this is Daryl. Certainly within those deferrals, there's a fair amount of requests from restaurants and
we have been working with those clients. I would – I don't think that we'll see them come back again until we get
through at least the 90 days and see where we are. On the hotels, the very little hotel exposure that we have most
of those who have been in asking for deferrals as you might imagine.
And on the CRE piece, much of that comes from either multifamily that had retail associated with it or the retail
has been closed down. Some just apartments early on were concerned about ability of their tenants to pay rent.
We looked at a little bit of that and then anything kind of retail, strip mall, those types of things were also heavy
requestors early on in this – in the deferral approval process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And Daryl as you're going through this process with your borrower, what kind of conversations do you have and in
terms of having them put more kind of skin in the game to work with you and to make sure you're not on the
hook?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Chris, so early on, we had some conversations with those clients but mostly just given the uncertainty and
the fact that we knew they're going to have constrains, we did a lot of these deferrals, just look back on their
operating history, if they hadn't had problems before, look to see what we thought was reasonable and then just
moved on. As we get to the end of the 90 days on those that we did 90 days, we will – we're going to be asking
for updated financial information on sponsors and have to sit down and have, in some cases, some tough
conversations if this hasn't turned around.
Some borrowers, we did 180-day extensions on because it made sense to do that. All of our relationship
managers will be out in 90 days talking with those clients, beginning to understand how deeply they've been
impacted and start to gather financial information, start to have those conversations about additional capital or
collateral or how we're going to work through this. It is so fluid right now.

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Morning, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe could you start just provide some insight into the accounting for the commercial and
consumer deferrals to keep accruing but the yield is now lower? And if so, could you talk about what type of
impact that that could have and I would assume it's built into your projections and outlook today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No change in, Terry, to how we accrue for them. Obviously, there's a cash flow impact on that, but relatively
minor. But we'll continue to accrue those as we normally would.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe, could you expand on the CD pricing over the next – I think you just said 6 or 12 months
kind of average rates today on the balance sheet – what current market rates are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, as I said, we're sitting at 1.34%. Three quarters of that book we'll reprice over the next 12 months. And
depending on the maturity and the tenor, I'm not giving you a specific number on that, but they'll be meaningfully
lower than they are today.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, maybe just one last quick one. Can you just talk about the impact of – on fee income in the first quarter
from some of the actions you took to help your clients? And maybe just some color on [ph] what happened in
(36:22) March or late in the quarter to help us on a year-over-year basis kind of model out some of those
transactional revenue lines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I would say the first quarter impact from some of the fee waivers was de minimis. [indiscernible] (36:38) on – all
kind of coming in the middle part of March, and so really didn't have a meaningful impact. I think as Brendon
pointed out though, I think everybody is seeing the spend slow down, right? And everybody saw service charges,
I think, across the industry be lower. It's just hard for us to get a handle on how permanent – we've already seen a
better pickup in April. And so, it's just really hard for us to have a pickup for – a view on how long this lasts and
what the exact impact is going to be.

James C. Ryan III A

Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. Can you talk about the magnitude –
I think, Brendon, you talked about it in your comments and Jim you just alluded to just the magnitude of the
increase in consumer activity. Is it meaningful at all or is it just very, very early?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think it's just very, very early. I will tell you – and Jon, you're in the Midwest so you understand. I mean, I see a
lot of people still buying food from restaurants and out and about. But clearly, card spend is down and that's going
to have an impact on, I think, the entire industry. But I think it's just too early to understand what the exact impact
is.
I guess what I'm optimistic is I know our state is having a lot of great conversations about return to work. And I'm
very optimistic that by the end of April, we will start to – start the economy back up here in the Midwest. And I

think hopefully card spend and other things will return back to kind of normal. I know it's going to take some time
to get fully back up to speed but I'm optimistic that the Midwest will start to restart and maybe some of the earliest
in the whole country.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A question for you guys as well on the loan demand today. You talked about the big pipeline that may not all pull
through, but what does the loan demand today look like compared to maybe what it was two or three or four
weeks ago? Looks like it was line draws initially but what does it look like today and what are the areas where
you're seeing the demand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Jon, this is Jim Sandgren. I'd say the pipeline is down a little bit. The breakdown of that pipeline is still kind
of 50% commercial real estate, the balance C&I. I think everyone is kind of taking a step back to see how this is
all going to impact their particular industries. [ph] Of (39:27) the pipeline, typically when we look at the accepted
category, it's about 90% to 95% likelihood we're going to close those deals. After reviewing with our commercial
segment leaders, I think that number drops to closer to 75%. Still a lot of deals I think to be booked, but there are
certainly going to be some borrowers that are going to be a little cautious and projects or investments may get
delayed a quarter or two. So, kind of a wait and see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Jon, I might add this is a little bit longer term view but I think manufacturers are looking at their supply chain today
and saying how much of this could be done onshore versus offshore. And I'm optimistic that the Midwest might
see some increased investment over the coming year or two, as people think about those critical suppliers in their
supply chain and how much of that really should be produced here in the US versus someplace else. And so I
think the Midwest can be a long-term beneficiary of that kind of new view of the supply chain dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Amen to that. I keep going with questions, but I have a couple of more follow-ups, I guess. Maybe Daryl or Scott,
you talked about the increased CRE deferrals and I'm curious, areas where you expect to see deferral increases
from here. And if you had any shot at what percentage of book do you think that could be deferred. I don't view
that as a negative. I guess I'm just curious as to how far you think this could go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Jon. This is Daryl. I think we have most of the deferral requests behind us. It has slowed considerably now,
maybe it pick back up after the PPP. But I just don't think that you're going to see significant increases or changes
going forward.

And then one more, Daryl, for you, just maybe more of an industry observation, I'm curious. The PPP, I don't want
to say loan quality, but any assessment of the business – health of the businesses that are in the PPP program
and how we should think about that longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Jon, that's really interesting. So, if you think about the program, none of the review of what we did on any
PPP loans had anything to do with the financial strength of those businesses, it was verification now. Anecdotally,
as we all work through those, it [ph] goes the gamut (41:59), right? We've got some very strong borrowers who
we're not concerned about at all that took advantage of this program and then we also have some very small
businesses who I'm sure have very little cash. And I know just by talking to some of them that they're asking when
does this money come. So, it is really all across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
These are things we'll eventually find out in you think a quarter or two and we'll know more on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. The PPP program is a program that is meant to bridge these borrowers through to keep people employed
and to the extent that as Jim suggested at least in our markets, so we can begin to open things up fairly quickly, I
think will have a really positive impact with respect to being able to get these businesses started up again. The
longer it goes, the more risk we have that these programs won't be as effective as we all hope they'll be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate the color you provided with the Moody's
Critical Pandemic Forecast. But curious if you could tell me – tell us what the specific economics inputs may have
been that you built into your reserving as far as it relates to unemployment in GDP?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, David, what we did is we look at every one of the Moody's forecast from the 10th, the 20th and the
27th. We run all of them through our models and sensitize the model. So we did consider all of the economic
forecasts. The one we actually went through and put through as a baseline for a model and then did qualitative
adjustments on top list with the one on the 20th.
And unemployment in there is – it goes up to about 6% and then stays elevated at around that level for an
extended period of time. GDP comes down pretty sharply, I think, 6%, 7% and then starts to rebound in a V-
shaped manner in Q4, starts growth again in 2021. Kind of growth at the same pace it was prior. Those are the
two key critical inputs into the model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And how frequently have they been providing you with updates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So through the quarter end, the last one we ran through our model was the one on the 27th but I believe there
was another one April 10 that came out. But that's not the one that we ran through our model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
And just as a reminder, we only expected to receive one forecast per quarter. So, interesting timing, having
multiple forecasts come out throughout the quarter, especially this is the first quarter we adopted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. I would assume that this is obviously new to them. But hopefully, we can get it to one per quarter at some
point here in the future. But I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
David, I will also add. Our sense is – is we've, obviously, compared a lot of notes with a lot of different banks and
a lot of different banks used a bunch of different forecasts, a bunch of different management overlays. And so, I
think you're just going to see as I said in my prepared comments, just kind of a wide variance in how we look at
this.
And every day makes a difference of how you view this, the future economics around the pandemic. And so, we
thought we put in place a very supportable forecast that made sense for us at the time. But every day you have
better optics and we're going to continue to wait and see and adjust as necessary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
