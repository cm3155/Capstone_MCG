Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Timothy S. Crane
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year call. For those we haven't spoken
to recently, Happy New Year. In addition to Dave Dykstra and Rich Murphy, who the host introduced, Dave
Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kate Boege, our General Counsel, are with me.
In terms of an agenda, I'll share some high-level highlights. Dave Dykstra will speak to the financial results, and
Rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance. I'll wrap up with some summary
thoughts on 2024, and as always, we'll do our best to answer some questions.
For the year, we reported record net income of just over $622 million, up 22% over 2023. The results reflect our
conservative approach to managing and growing our franchise. Specifically, we target steady growth in both loans
and deposits, sound and conservative liquidity and risk management, and an unwavering commitment to taking
care of our clients. In our materials, as we do at every year-end, we have also included a series of 10-year
historical charts that show solid progress on key metrics, evidence that our approach not only works but
differentiates us from many of our peers. While this is not new information, we think these charts are meaningful
evidence of our strong and consistent performance and if you haven't already, I would encourage you to look at
and review these materials.
For the fourth quarter, net income was just over $123 million, a solid result given the recognition of a $34.4 million
extraordinary expense related to the replenishment of the FDIC Fund following the March bank failures, and an
approximately $10 million expense related to the write-down of certain mortgage-related assets due to the falling
interest rates during the quarter. We reported record net interest income of $470 million, up approximately $8
million from the third quarter as a result of both an increase in the net interest margin of 2 basis points to 3.64%
and continued good loan growth. Deposits were also up in the quarter. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased
slightly and were steady as a percentage of total deposits.
While we continue to expect credit performance to normalize from the very low levels experienced over the last
few years, our losses and NPLs remain low. Despite these low credit losses, we've continued to build the
allowance. And as you'll hear from Rich, we continue to proactively address challenged credits in our portfolio.
I would highlight that our allowance coverage for core loans, excluding primarily our low loss insurance finance
portfolio, is at a healthy 1.55%. This detail is in Table 12 of our press release. The market rate decreases during
the quarter that caused the adjustment to the value of the mortgage assets also led to a material improvement in
AOCI, driving up our book value and capital levels. The tangible book value increased by $385 million to over $70
a share during the quarter.
You'll see in one of the charts that I mentioned, that our book value has increased every year during the 10-year
period shown. And in fact, if you were to go further back, our tangible book value has increased every year since
the company went public in 1996. Our liquidity position remains strong. Overall, a solid quarter, which we believe
will compare well and may differentiate us relative to many of our competitors.
With that, I'll turn this over to Dave and Rich. And as I mentioned, I'll come back and wrap up with some thoughts
on the 2024 outlook.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Great. Thanks, Tim. First, with respect to the balance sheet growth, we were again pleased to see loans for the
quarter grow by approximately $686 million or 7% on an annualized basis, consistent with our prior guidance of
mid- to high-single-digit loan growth. The increase in loans was across many of the loan categories, but was
primarily related to commercial real estate and commercial premium finance portfolio growth. And Rich Murphy
will talk about that in just a little bit.
The company also recorded deposit growth of $404 million during the quarter, which is a 4% increase over the
prior quarter on an annualized basis. And as to deposit composition, non-interest-bearing deposits at the end of
the third quarter and fourth quarter both represented 23% of total deposits, evidencing the stabilization of the non-
interest-bearing balances during the latter half of 2023. Other balance sheet results were that, total assets grew
by approximately $705 million. We had slightly increased ending loan-to-deposit ratio and our capital ratios were
relatively stable, with most of those ratios increasing slightly. Overall, a very successful quarter for the growth of
the franchise. Our differentiated business model, exceptional team and service, and the unique position in
Chicago and Milwaukee markets continues to serve us very well in that regard.
Turning to the income statement categories, starting with net interest income. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net
interest income totaled $470 million, an increase of $7.6 million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase
of $13.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. I should note that the fourth quarter net interest income
represents the highest quarterly amount ever recorded by the company. The increase in net interest income as
compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets of approximately $509
million. An increase in the company's net interest margin also contributed to the increase in net interest income.
The net interest margin was 3.64% in the fourth quarter, which was 2 basis points higher than the prior quarter
level.
Accordingly, as we discussed on prior calls, our balance sheet composition, structure, and repricing
characteristics provided for a relatively stable net interest margin during the quarter. And based on the current
interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain our net interest margin within a narrow range around the
current levels during the first quarter of 2024 and beyond, in 2024, assuming the rates stay at roughly the same.
I'd also like to note that total loans as of December 31 were $770 million higher than the average total loans in the
fourth quarter, which obviously provides us with some momentum into the first quarter of 2024. The combination
of the expected balance sheet growth and relatively stable net interest margin should allow for further growth of
our net interest income in the first quarter of this year.
Turning to provision for credit losses. Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $42.9 million in the fourth
quarter. This is up from a provision of $19.9 million in the prior quarter, but actually down from the $47.6 million of
provision recorded in the year-ago quarter. The higher provision expense in the fourth quarter relative to the third
quarter was primarily the result of higher net loan growth during the quarter, a slightly higher level of net charge-
offs and some deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic conditions, primarily wider forecasted Baa credit
spreads and forecasted depreciation in the commercial real estate price index. Rich will talk about the credit and
loan characteristics in just a bit.
Regarding the other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Total non-interest income totaled $100.8
million in the fourth quarter, which was down approximately $11.6 million when compared to the prior quarter. The
primary reason for the decline was related to $20 million less of mortgage banking revenue. Relative to the third
quarter, mortgage revenue had a $9.7 million unfavorable change in net valuation adjustments from our mortgage
servicing rights assets and certain other mortgage-related assets that we hold at fair value. Those declines were
really due to a decline late in the fourth quarter in the mortgage rates and accelerated prepayment speeds.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
We also experienced $7 million decline in production revenue due to seasonally lower volume and compressed
gain on sale margins. But I think it's interesting to note that although our production revenue was lower than the
prior quarter, it's actually higher than the fourth quarter of the prior year, which is encouraging for us. We are also
encouraged that with a lower rate environment that our application volume is ticking up early in 2024 thus far.
Albeit still at low levels, we are seeing increases over application volumes that we were receiving in January of
last year, and application volumes that are slightly up from December of 2023.
There is a variety of relatively smaller changes to the other non-interest income categories as shown in the tables
in the earnings release, but those changes were not unusual and in the aggregate resulted in an increase in the
non-mortgage-related categories of approximately $8.3 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to non-interest expenses. Non-interest expenses totaled $362.7 million in the fourth quarter and were up
approximately $32.6 million from the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase was the negative impact of
the $34.4 million special assessment by the FDIC to pay for the two of the bank failures that occurred earlier in
2023. The remaining variances in non-interest expense, both positive and negative, offset to a relatively small
reduction in non-interest expenses from the prior quarter of just under $2 million.
In summary, it was a very good, solid quarter in our view, with good loan and deposit growth, a stable net interest
margin with the steady outlook, a record level of net interest income and a continued low level of nonperforming
assets. We feel like we've managed well through a somewhat turbulent period in 2023 delivering net income that
was a record for any full fiscal year in the company's history, and we have a positive outlook for continued growth
in assets, revenue and earnings.
And although it's easy to get caught up in looking at the quarterly results, I think it's also instructive to occasionally
look back over time. As Tim referred to, we included some 10-year charts in the earnings release that I think
provide some impressive evidence that our approach to running the business has provided for a consistent
growth in loans, deposits, earnings and tangible book value per share over an extended period of time, all while
managing credit risk very well. We'll work hard to continue those trends in 2024 and beyond and increase
shareholder returns.
So, with that, I'll conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.

Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As Tim and Dave noted earlier, credit performance continued to be very solid in the fourth quarter
from a number of perspectives. As detailed on slide 7 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $686 million,
and similar to the third quarter, this growth was driven by a number of factors. We continue to see a harder
market for insurance premiums, particularly for commercial properties, resulting in higher average loan sizes in
our commercial premium finance portfolio. And consolidation within the premium finance industry has provided us
with a number of new opportunities. We a saw good growth in the commercial real estate portfolio, resulting
largely from draws on existing construction loans. And finally, our leasing group had another very solid quarter.
Total loan growth for all of 2023 was $2.9 billion or 7%. We believe that loan growth for 2024 will continue to be
within our guidance for the following reasons. The commercial premium finance team should continue to show
solid growth as premiums continue to be elevated. Our various pipelines have stayed very solid and our leasing
team continue to see significant demand in the market. And as we've noted in prior calls, we continue to benefit
from disruptions in the banking landscape and we've seen numerous quality opportunities in our core C&I and

CRE business. In addition, we continue to look at a number of lending teams and niche lending opportunities that
come from dislocation in other regional banks.
Offsetting this growth will be continued pressure on C&I line utilization, which dropped from 37% to 34% year-
over-year as higher borrowing costs have negatively affected usage. We anticipate that higher borrowing costs
will continue to cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects, business expansion and equipment
purchases.
In summary, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans in 2024, and we believe our diversified
portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid- to high-
single-digits and maintain our credit discipline.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 14, we continue to see strong credit performance across
the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Nonperforming loans increased by $6 million during the
quarter from 32 to 33 basis points. While NPLs have increased from 26 basis points to 33 basis points during
2023, they continue to be at historically low levels, and we are confident about the solid credit performance of the
portfolio. Charge-offs for the quarter were $14.9 million or 14 basis points, up from $8.1 million or 8 basis points in
Q3. Finally, as detailed on slide 14, we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no
meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level.
As noted in our last few earnings calls, we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real
estate loans, which comprises roughly one quarter of our total portfolio. Higher borrowing costs and pressure on
occupancy and lease rates are cause for concern, particularly in the office category as we've noted before.
On our second quarter call earlier this year, we noted that we are very focused on a subset of office loans, which
are secured by coworking properties. At that time, we had sold a portfolio of approximately $17 million, which
reduced our total coworking exposure in half. During the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in CRE NPLs of
$17.4 million, which was largely due to a downgrade of a single coworking loan to nonperforming. It's important to
note that the underlying loan is current and has been previously identified as a potential nonaccrual due to cash
flow issues. We continue to work with the borrower to determine the most cost-effective strategy going forward.
On slide 18, we have updated a number of important characteristics of our office portfolio. Currently, this portfolio
remains steady at $1.4 billion or 12.8% of our total CRE portfolio and only 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. Of the
$1.4 billion of office exposure, 42% is medical office or owner occupied. The average size of the portfolio loan in
the office portfolio is only $1.4 million, and we continue to have only five loans above $20 million in this category.
We continue to perform reviews regularly on this portfolio, and we stay very engaged with our borrowers. As
mentioned on prior calls, our CRE credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every loan over [ph]
$2.5 million (00:16:44), which will be renewing between now and the end of the third quarter of 2024.
This analysis, which covered 82% of all CRE loans maturing during this period resulted in the following:
approximately one-half of these loans will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates. Roughly 35% of these
loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a short-term extension at prevailing rates. The remaining 14% of
these loans will require some additional attention, which could include a paydown or a pledge of additional
collateral.
It's important to note that the previously mentioned loans secured by coworking space had been identified during
our prior deep dive analysis. We have back-checked the results of these tests conducted during prior quarters

and have found that the projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated. And generally
speaking, borrowers of loans deem to require additional attention, continue to support their loans by providing
enhancements, including principal reductions.
Again, our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates, but we
continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to identify the best
possible outcomes. We believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape and situated to weather the
challenges ahead.
That concludes my comments on credit, and I'll turn it back to Tim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Rich. To wrap up our prepared remarks, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned,
perhaps uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse businesses. Over
the last several quarters, we've taken steps to achieve an interest sensitivity position much closer to neutral. You
can see some specific data on Table 8 in our press release.
While we don't believe that rapid rate cuts are warranted at this point, we are assuming that there will be 325
basis point rate cuts in 2024. With that assumption, as Dave mentioned, our net interest margin will be reasonably
stable in a narrow range around the current level for the near term. More interest rate cuts above and beyond the
three we've assumed would slightly pressure the margin, but would also likely result in more favorable economic
activity as an offset. For example, improvements in our mortgage business and growth in commercial line
utilization, which Rich mentioned is at currently very low levels.
So to reiterate our prior comments, our target is to continue to grow loans in the mid- to high-single-digit range in
terms of our percentage and to fund the loan growth through deposit increases at like levels. Our pipelines remain
solid. And as Dave mentioned, we experienced strong growth at the end of the fourth quarter, which represents
good momentum going into the first quarter of 2024. Overall, we're pleased with the 2023 results, and we're
encouraged about where we start 2024. I know there'll be some questions. So at this point, I'll pause and we can
turn it back to the host.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Maybe Tim or Dave, just wanted to ask about some of the last comments you made, Tim, on your
expectations for the margin to remain in the current range. Can you talk about what you guys are doing to protect
the margin around these levels? I think about your loan growth guidance and the net interest income growth
potential. It seems a little better than peers, particularly your loan growth, but just talk about how you're protecting
the margin and your confidence that we can maintain the current range absent greater than three cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Jon, and Dave can add to this. We've talked about the fact that we've got an asset-sensitive loan
book that continues to reprice. And at this point, the repricing in our loan book is closely correlated to what we're
seeing in terms of the increase in deposit costs. We expect that for at least a short period going forward here, that
that will continue to be the case and that the spread between our loan and deposits will be roughly stable. I would
characterize stable as plus or minus some number of basis points, around 3.6%. So, we feel pretty good about
that and we've baked in the three cuts, starting in June. If those cuts are either deeper or more than I think we've
got probably some pressure on the margin, but an offset in other parts of our business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Another thing to focus, I mean, I think that's true, the structure of the balance sheet also helps too. The
premium finance book, which is a third of our portfolio, sort of lagged on the way up, but if rates go down, it also
lags on the way down. So, there's benefit to us there. As you know, and as we've disclosed in the materials, we've
got over [ph] $6 billion (00:22:07) worth of interest rate derivatives that will also assist us if rates fall down.
So, we were patient when rates went up to allow the margin to expand. And as we hit the upper 3s, we felt like we
should reduce that asset sensitivity and lock in the rates through balance sheet management and derivatives. And
we've tried to become relatively neutral on that rate now just by using both the structure and the derivatives to be
somewhat neutral here. So, the competition's out there. So we'll depend on what the competition does with loan
and deposit pricing if rates move. But right now, the way we look at the world, we think we can hold it pretty tight.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Just one more revenue question just on mortgage. You touched on it, but obviously a
tougher revenue quarter for mortgage, and I get it, but, I think what you're saying is, originations look good,
spreads were depressed. And if we don't have the same headwinds on the MSR, maybe we can repeat the kind
of quarter that we saw in the first quarter of 2023. Is that fair, Dave, maybe even potentially a little better?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's pretty accurate, Jon. I mean, our production revenue was down about $7 million – to about $7
million of production revenue. But that was higher than about $3 million of production revenue in 2022 and we had
$8 million to $9 million of production revenue in 2023. So, what we're seeing is, right now, at least through the first
part of January, applications are ticking up, again, not wildly. But they are up from December and November and
clearly they're up from where we were in January of 2023. So, I would expect that, that revenue would sort of get
back to those levels based on what we know right now. Again, it's not going to be a spike up, but I do think we're
going to sort of return to where we've been in the previous few quarters.
And then hopefully that if the spring buying season hits, that mortgage rates are down a little bit. And hence one
of the reasons some of the MSR values declined a little bit. But, hopefully that decline in rate spurs a little bit of
additional home-buying activity come March and April.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe a question for Rich. I mean, you guys have in the past fourth quarters, I would say, proactively built the
reserve when things are still good. Given where your reserves sit today, I guess, can you just speak to the
potential need or desire to build reserves additionally in early 2024? Or is this just kind of a get ahead of it and
build it while you can?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
CECL doesn't necessarily work that way. I mean, yeah. So, I mean, I – if you were asking me how the
provisioning should work, it wouldn't – not necessarily result in the same things that we're getting out of the CECL
models. Because, as Dave pointed out, I mean, we – the Baa spreads, the way they reacted, definitely affected
what we had to do in the fourth quarter. There's just – the loan growth affected it, and not necessarily what Rich
Murphy thinks about the quality of the portfolio.
I do think that what we've done, as you point out, at the end of last year, this year, was pretty material. And I think
we have put ourselves in a very good position going forward. And if CECL works like it's supposed to work, we're
actually pre-funding the losses that should accumulate down the road. So, I actually – I feel really good as to
where the allowance is given the shape of our portfolio right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And, Chris, I can maybe chime in a little bit. I think if you look at it sort of globally without getting too far into the
weeds, if you look in the presentation, our criticized assets that we have a special mention on substandard and
good, those percentages held very stable. Charge-offs were still low at 14 basis points, a little higher than second
quarter, but still pretty low. And we had a little bit more growth in the quarter. But, all those things weren't too
different quarter-to-quarter.
So, as you look at that increase, I think most of that is the macroeconomic factors and the biggest one that
impacted us in our models. And everybody uses different factors for their modeling, but the Baa credit spread has
a high correlation to many of our loan lines that we model for. And that that spread over the eight quarter period
that we look at, going out, expanded quite a bit which had a big impact on our provisioning.
So, if the soft landing thoughts gain traction and the consensus view amongst economists out there are that those
spreads should tighten in, then we should see some benefit going forward. But in the fourth quarter, it was worse
than the third quarter and it really generated the extra reserves.

Okay. That's great color. Thanks. Just I know some banks have disclosed which are the Moody's scenarios and

baseline scenario.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Maybe just one more and I'll hop back. The capital outlook, mid- to high-single-digit balance sheet growth.
Your ROE can certainly support more growth. How do we think about perhaps other uses of capital in 2024? Any
thawing in M&A conversations? Is that something you would consider? Any color on capital use would be great.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, the straightforward part is that, as you said, the earnings of the company should support the loan
growth, that's been the case for several quarters now, but isn't a long-term trend for Wintrust, where, typically
we've needed to add capital to the extent, one, we continue to build capital, that's good. And on the M&A front, I
would say that the conversations are still active, but there's also not a lot of activity. And I don't know that others
who might be in a position that it's better to talk about that would think that there's going to be a short-term
change there. Clearly, the rates coming down and help the AOCI situation for a number of people who had
impaired either loan books or securities portfolio. But we've been acquisitive in the past. I think we may be in the
future, but we're disciplined about it.

David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think generally we're believing that at this point that if the Fed cuts, 25 for the non-CD, term CDs that
are fixed that we should be able to reduce the rates fairly quickly by 25 basis points. So, we're expecting as we
increased rates rapidly as rates went up, we're expecting to be able to follow fairly closely with cuts in our money
markets and savings and the like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Casey, the other thing we're seeing, we don't have a huge book of municipal deposits, but some of those have
reference rates, if you will, and we're starting to see as a result of what's happening with rates, those index or
reference rates come down. And so, we've seen some minor benefit on a portion of the book already.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just a question on the fixed rate asset repricing benefit. In the release, you guys called out
about [ph] $8 billion (00:32:13) that matures within or reprices within the next year. Just wondering, do you have
the – what the yield is on that? And what it could reprice to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. We haven't disclosed that, Casey. I don't have it handy here right now, but we'll think about putting that
in future releases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just lastly, the loan-to-deposit ratio ticked up a little bit to 93%. I think you guys have talked
about 85% to 90%. I know you're talking about funding loan growth with deposits. But just wondering if there is a
hard cap on that loan-to-deposit ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. We think we like it. Sort of in this range is fine with us. It ticked up a little bit. I would expect it to come down
again next quarter. A lot of our loan growth just happened near the end of the quarter and so we were just trying
to match deposit loan growth and there was a lot that flowed in towards the latter part of December. So, just a
little probably mismatch on the timing of the deposit raising, but probably expect that to drift back down to [ph]
92% (00:33:28) again next quarter or so.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Rich, I wanted to circle back on the co-work, you singled out the one credit of, I think,
$17.4 million. What is the total remaining co-work exposure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Negligible. I think there might be certainly under $5 million. I think pretty well below that. There might a couple of
small pieces, but generally that were largely with this issue being largely addressed, I think that largely is behind
us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So that was the bulk of it, I guess. And then just sort of tracking some of those tables towards the back,
was that credit identified and sliding from kind of past due?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. The loan was current.
[indiscernible] (00:34:52)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah, yeah. Got it. Okay. And maybe just hopping to expenses, safe to assume that quarterly FDIC insurance
reverts back in the mid $9 million range? In other words, absent the special assessment, that could be a good run
rate for 2024. And then kind of the follow-on question to that is, just overall expense run rate expectations there
would be helpful? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, clearly, special assessment is a onetime item. I think towards the end of the couple of years out,
depending on how those things settle out, they may true it up a little bit. For now, yes, that number goes away and
you'd be in that mid-$9 million range. But that assessment grows as the company grows. So, as much as we don't
like to pay the assessment, probably that expense number goes up because we're going to grow the franchise
over the course of the year. But you can see that it's trended up over time. So, we would only expect it to go up
with the growth of the balance sheet though.
And then, overall expenses, it's sort of similar to what we've talked about in the past. If you sort of look at the non-
FDIC-impacted run rates of the third and the fourth quarter, those will probably increase slightly in 2024 as we
have merit raises for the employees and the impact of inflation. The impact of the FDIC insurance coverage
increasing as we grow. And we continue to invest in our infrastructure, digital and technology-wise, but – so
probably that 5% mid-single digit range is what we would expect using the third and the fourth quarters as a base.
And if we can grow loans on the franchise in the mid- to high-single-digit range, we can get that operating
leverage out of the system.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Sounds good. Thank you. And then the last one just, and you kind of touched on a little bit, but in that mid- to
high-single-digit loan growth outlook for 2024, do you have anything kind of layered in there? Is it sort of a soft
landing type assumption or that's a crystal ball-type question? But for the bulk of 2024, do you have a
recessionary or slowdown macro-wise embedded?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, my answer to that would be, we've fortunately got a diversified and pretty granular loan book. So, as we've
talked about in the past, the transportation business and some of our customers are already experiencing
challenging conditions and others are doing terrific. So, I don't know that a technical recession is much going to
change the environment and we think across our loan book, we'll get a pretty balanced level of growth over the
year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great point, Tim, because we have all these different engines that just fire at different times. If you
kind of look at where the growth is coming from over this last year, our life premium finance group essentially had
zero or actually negative growth, largely because in a higher rate environment, it doesn't work. If you got into a
recessionary-type situation and they bring rates down, that product suddenly looks much more attractive. And a
lot of the loan growth that we had two years ago was out of that product.
So, as different as the right rate cycles move through, they definitely affect different things. Right now, as we
talked about, line utilization in a higher rate environment really gets impacted. If rates come down, you're going to
see the opposite effect. So, I think there's going to be some cyclicality, but it's just going to affect different
products at different times. So we stay pretty committed to that mid- to high-single-digit growth forecast.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
So, I had a question on deposits. I noticed, most of the growth in the quarter came from money market and
savings accounts. And I'm wondering if – or is that the expectation going forward where we'll see most of the
deposit growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we think the mix has somewhat stabilized, but with these higher rates than we had a year or 18 months ago,
clearly the interest-bearing products are more attractive to our clients. And so, I think you're going to see money
market and CD growth that you wouldn't have seen a couple of years ago. And we're working hard and hopeful
that the non-interest bearing portion continues to stay reasonably stable around 23%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And is part of that strategy also sort of anticipating a Fed easing cycle as maybe those money market
accounts maybe easier to lower those rates, I guess, faster than if we do more of the CD funding?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think what you said is correct that the money market accounts would probably move more quickly than
some of the other interest-bearing products. But we offer a wide set of options to our customers and they select
what they believe to be the best fit for them. So, we are seeing more CD-related activity as you can get rates in
the 5% range, whether that'll continue as rates come down, you may get people trying to kind of lock-in those
levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then another question, I know, I appreciate the commentary on the reserve increase, but I did notice
the reserve increase was primarily in the C&I category. So, I just wonder if you could speak to just the health of
your C&I customers and credit trends there as opposed to a lot of attention is on the CRE [ph] space (00:41:23)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, a couple of things that I would point to. One is, as we noted earlier, that the level of classified assets
remains pretty consistent. So, we try to be very proactive on our risk ratings. And if you start to see special
mention, classified assets start to move up, I think that would be a pretty direct reflection. But more anecdotally,
we spend a lot of time talking to our customers about where their business is at. And I would say, generally
speaking, people still feel like that top line revenue number is holding together pretty well, and that solves a lot of
problems. Obviously, higher borrowing costs can affect them. Clearly, the economy, I think, has slowed a little bit
and so that's affected them.
But while it may not be as rosy when you had zero interest rates and the economy was just really clicking along, it
doesn't feel that bad for most of our C&I customers. I think that they still feel pretty optimistic about where their
overall revenues are coming from and where those levels will be. I think labor has probably become less of a
concern for them. And just overall, input costs are – have stabilized. So, I would say just net-net, I think they feel
still pretty good.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Great. That's for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question, which comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger of Citi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hey, Ben.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
So, I'm going to ask a question, I know you're probably going to be a little annoyed, but I'm going to ask it anyway.
So, when you think about 2024, what I'm getting is kind of mid-single digit, maybe upper-middle-single-digit loan
growth, deposit growth, it's kind of flat margin at the – like what would you said, if three cuts, kind of a 360 range.
If the market has a little bit more, probably see a little bit pressure on that. That's largely just because of back
book repricing on some CRE, and then premium finance still has a little tail left in it.
But as we get towards the end of the year and possibly into 2024, if there is a four cut amount rate cut
environment, do you think – is there any incremental pressure? Because, I mean, like you said, the premium
finance probably rolls over and starts to work against you, but you also have indexed deposit costs. I'm just trying
to think, it's a moving target, obviously, but just any incremental thoughts on how you might exit the year and into
2025? And I get you haven't given 2025 guidance at all. So just kind of finger in the air, that would be really
helpful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, couple of things. To be clear, we have very few actual index deposit products. So, while the municipal rates,
for example, that I mentioned earlier, are tied to some reference rates, they're not contractual. So, other than our
CD book, we're largely pricing at our discretion. As we talked about, if you get more rate cuts or faster rate cuts or
you get 50, they slightly would pressure our margin beyond the assumed three cuts. But our mortgage business
would likely perform better. And to Rich's point, we're at very low levels in terms of utilization on lines right now
and we would expect to see some rebound there as rates come down. So, while there might be some pressure on
the margin as rates continue to drop, we have other aspects of our business that we think will perform well. So,
that's kind of the best way we're looking at that and why we value the diversified businesses as an important part
of our model.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's great color. It's a great point, too, that the fee income aspect will definitely kind of pick up some of
the slack, or if not all the slack goes to the softer spread revenue. Can you just remind us any sort of kind of
efficiency ratio on mortgage? I guess that we haven't seen a robust mortgage market. I'm just trying to think, like,

if that does start to turn back on, expenses are also obviously going to go up as well. I'm just trying to match the
two, if we do see a rebound in mortgage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. It sort of depends on how hot the market gets and how wide gross margin – the gain-on-sale margins are.
But I generally think of the efficiency ratio and the mortgage business will be in about an 80% efficiency ratio
business. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's really helpful. Appreciate the color. It looks like you guys have kind of a pure growth [ph]
horsepower (00:46:22) year. It's good that the margin should stay roughly flat. So, I'm looking forward to it.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Dave and I'm pretty sure it's in the appendix, but what are the hedges costing you each
quarter, like $24 million comes to mind. But do you have that number handy? And what is that – what would that
be if we get three-rate cuts? And when does that turn from a headwind to a tailwind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, so, I think it was about 19 basis points of impact to the margin and it's about $8 million a month, so
$24 million a quarter. Right now, if SOFR moved one way or the other, that would change that. But we put a slide
in our presentation deck that gives all the details of what the particular strike rates are. But we're receiving fixed
and paying variables. So, if SOFR goes down at all, even though we may not hit the strike rate, we'll get benefit
because we'll pay less. So that $24 million a quarter, if SOFR comes down, will decline by what we pay by 25
basis points. So, it's effectively locking in [ph] $6 billion (00:47:52) worth of our variable rate portfolio into more of
a fixed rate scenario that are SOFR based.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then, are you or how are you using loan modifications within commercial real estate? And
how are you defining a market rate if you are using modifications?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, modifications are part of the business. But we don't – if a loan is seriously affected by lease rates
or vacancy or rising rates, and you can't just hide a problem with a loan modification. So similar to the one that we

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
just identified, that loan is current. But at some point, you have to look at that, and say, is there really going to be
the opportunity to change the income stream or change the cash flow with a modification? Generally speaking,
you really have to be honest and the borrower and the bank have to be honest about whether that's going to solve
the problem.
In a case like that, it's so challenged that it's not. So we do use modifications, but it's really got to be a situation
where the difference between the targeted policy-driven cash flow coverage and the actual cash flow coverage
are relatively close. And you're just working with them to maybe extend the amortization a little bit or something
like that to give them a little bit of relief to bridge the gap. But generally speaking, I mean, we don't use
modifications all that often, and when we do, we're pretty much – the interest rate is pretty much at market rate.

Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to get a little bit more granular, Dave, on the loan yields. I understand
the margin commentary that you gave, but wanted to kind of ask you, just given the premium finance books, how
you expect the loan yields to trend in the middle part of the year just given the moves in the one-year CMT that
have already occurred?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, the book that's tied to the one-year CMT is the life insurance premium finance book. And so, as
you're alluding to, the rate now is very similar to the rate a year ago. So, the benefit from that book is pretty baked
in right now. So the repricing on those should stay relatively the same. The commercial premium finance book,
however, is still is repricing over time. And although those are not indexed to the Prime rate, they have pretty
good correlation to the Prime rate because we generally are adjusting our rates when the Fed is adjusting, and
therefore most people are adjusting Prime.
And if you go back a year, Prime was 7.5% at the end of 2022 and 8.5% at the end of this year. So, there's
another 100 basis points of repricing on that portion of the book. And then we have the fixed rate commercial real
estate loan book that we have out there, some of that will reprice too.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And the stuff that's fixed rate that's not like premium finance-related at all, how much of that do you expect
to reprice on a quarterly basis over the next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we've got $8 billion in total, but if you look at that, the big portion of that is our premium finance portfolio at
$6.8 million. So, we had another $1.2 billion of commercial and commercial real estate type of loans that will
reprice over the course of the year. And I would probably just say it's ratable. I don't think we have any
seasonality per se to that portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A

And that these levels is generally slightly helpful as they reprice.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Understood. Is it fair to assume when I look at that kind of one- to five-year bucket as well that it's a
similarly ratable repricing there? I'm just trying to make sure I get the cadence correct through 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We sort of looked at this. We don't have any maturity walls coming from – that you can say, oh my gosh,
when we get out 18 months, we're going to have just boatload repricing or we don't get any repricing for three or
four years. It's fairly ratable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. On the NIBs, you guys kind of bucked the trend versus the group this quarter. A lot of other banks have
actually seen a reacceleration in NIB outflow. Wanted to ask you specifically if there was anything that drove the

institutional-type money?

No. Not significantly. I mean, we have large flows at the end of the year as people position their balance sheets.
But we've worked really hard on the deposit side of the equation to continue to grow clients, and we are hopeful
that the 23% turns into a stable level for us. And our team continues to add commercial clients that have non-
interest-bearing deposits and treasury services and use other products and services we offer. So, it's sort of a
function of building the franchise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's the way, I would look at it, too. I mean, Rich talked about there's little less line usage. So, some of
those people that maybe would have drawn on the line have used some of their non-interest-bearing deposits and
maybe that's a reason why you're seeing some of that industrywide. But as Tim said, if we continue to grow the
franchise and add customers that right now was offsetting any of that additional leakage and we're being able to
hold it pretty well. And it's been pretty stable on an average basis for the last couple of quarters. So, we're hopeful
that we can hold it in there.

Great. And then just last one for me is just on the wealth businesses are pretty decent pickup in the assets under
administration this quarter after they were flat last quarter. I just wanted to ask what caused that to occur?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
For the revenue to be flattish you're saying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Just the growth, I think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No. The AUA was up from $44.7 billion to $47.1 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. A couple of things with that. Some of the brokerage accounts grew a little bit. We also – our MaxSafe
product that we have, the way we operate that is, that works through our trust company as a fiduciary account. So
those get included shows a little bit of growth in that area and just a little bit spread out in other places. So,
nothing significant per se in any one chunky sort of deal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.

Yeah. And we also in that number as we note in the press release, our investment portfolio was is also managed
out of our wealth management area and included in those assets under management. Now, those ticked up a little
bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. So that – the move higher shouldn't necessarily result in a similar move higher in revenue for next
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Some of it is based on beginning of quarter asset valuations versus daily or end of quarter, so you might see a
little bit of pickup there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
