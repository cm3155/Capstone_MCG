Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill,
the Director of Investor Relations for PNC. And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill
Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor
Relations. These statements speak only as of October 15, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update
them.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

Thank you. Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a very good third quarter. We executed
well and saw strong momentum across our franchise. We generated $1.5 billion in net income or $3.49 diluted
earnings per share.
Rob will take you through the details shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few points. First, we generated positive
operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. And as an aside, our strong performance has positioned us
to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2024. Inside of the third quarter performance, NII grew 3%
as we continue our growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. Our fee income grew 10%, with a very
strong quarter in capital markets, and we remain disciplined on the expense front.
Second, we continue to see strong growth in activity across our franchise. C&IB continues to have great
momentum as new loan production and commitments increased this quarter. While overall loan utilization has
remained soft, the recent Fed actions to lower interest rates and the expectation of further cuts is likely to spur
greater demand as we move ahead. Importantly, we are well-positioned to serve our customers when loan growth
returns.
Within retail, we continued to invest heavily in our branch network to build density in our most attractive growth
markets, and we are seeing success. We continue to grow customer households and checking accounts with the
highest customer growth being realized in the southwest markets. AMG is accelerating growth in high-opportunity
markets and benefiting from favorable equity markets.

Third, our overall credit quality remains relatively stable, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk,
customer selection, and long-term relationship development. While we expect additional charge-offs in the CRE
office segment, we're adequately reserved.
Lastly, we continued to strengthen our capital levels during the quarter. And with the ongoing improvement in
AOCI, our tangible book value per share increased 9%.
In summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter and we remain well-positioned to continue our momentum.
In fact, we're in the middle of our strategic planning process, and I can't recall a time when our organic growth
opportunities have ever been more attractive.
Now, before I turn it over to Rob for more detail on the financial results and outlook, I'd like to say thank you to our
employees for everything that they do for our customers and our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to
take you through the quarter. Rob?

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average linked
quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable; investment securities increased slightly by $1 billion or 1%; and
our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $45 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 10%.
Deposit balances grew $5 billion or 1%, and averaged $422 billion. Borrowed funds decreased $1 billion or 2%,
primarily due to the maturity of FHLB advances, partially offset by parent company debt issuances. At quarter
end, AOCI was negative $5.1 billion, an improvement of $2.4 billion or 32% compared with June 30.
Our tangible book value increased to approximately $97 per common share, which was a 9% increase linked
quarter and a 24% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well-capitalized and our
estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as of September 30.
Regarding the Basel III Endgame, while certain aspects of the proposed rules are likely to change, we estimate
our revised standardized ratio, which includes AOCI, to be 9.2% at quarter end. We continue to be well-positioned
with capital flexibility and we returned roughly $800 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through
common dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Average loan balances of $320 billion were flat compared to the second
quarter, as well as the same period a year ago. And the yield on total loans increased 8 basis points to 6.13% in
the third quarter.
Commercial loans were stable at $219 billion linked quarter as utilization rates remained low and well below the
historical average of roughly 55%. We continue to have confidence that commercial loan demand will return in the
coming quarters as our loan commitments continue to increase, and we expect business investment to return to
historical levels. Consumer loans averaged $101 billion and were stable with the second quarter, as growth in
auto loans was mostly offset by a decline in residential real estate balances.
Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $142 billion
increased $1 billion or 1%. The securities portfolio yield increased 24 basis points to 3.08%, driven by higher rates

on new purchases and the full quarter impact of the securities repositioning. As of September 30, our securities
portfolio duration was approximately 3.3 years.
Our active receive fixed rate swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on September 30, and
the weighted average rate increased 58 basis points to 3.08%. Our forward starting swaps were $15 billion, with a
weighted average receive rate of 4.26%. Importantly, with our forward starting swaps, we've locked in the
replacement yield on the majority of our 2025 swap maturities at levels higher than existing swaps in current
market rates.
Turning to slide 7. We expect considerable run off of lower yielding securities and swaps, which will allow us to
continue to reinvest into higher yielding assets over the next couple of years. Accumulated other comprehensive
income improved by approximately $2.4 billion or 32% to negative $5.1 billion on September 30, compared to
negative $7.4 billion on June 30. The linked quarter improvement in AOCI was primarily due to lower rates, which
benefited our swap and available for sale portfolio valuations. Going forward, AOCI related to these securities and
swaps, as well as our held to maturity portfolio, will accrete back as they mature and prepay, resulting in further
growth to tangible book value.
Slide 8 covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits increased $5 billion or 1%, reflecting an
increase in interest-bearing commercial balances, as well as higher time deposits. Regarding mix, non-interest-
bearing deposits were stable at $96 billion and remained at 23% of total average deposits. Our rate paid on
interest-bearing deposits increased 11 basis points during the third quarter to 2.72%, reflecting growth in
commercial interest-bearing deposits.
We believe our total rate paid on deposits has reached its peak level. And with the 50 basis point cut in
September, we've already begun to reduce deposit pricing. Looking forward, we expect the Federal Reserve to
cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points at both the November and December meetings, which will accelerate
deposit repricing, particularly within our high beta commercial interest-bearing deposits.
Turning to slide 9, we highlight our income statement trends. Third quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.49
per share. Comparing the third quarter to the second quarter, total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $21 million;
net interest income grew by $108 million or 3%; and our net interest margin was 2.64%, an increase of 4 basis
points. Fee income increased $176 million or 10%.
Other non-interest income was $69 million and included negative $128 million of Visa-related activity. Non-interest
expense at $3.3 billion decreased $30 million or 1%. As a result, PPNR grew 2% linked quarter, and we
generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. Provision was $243 million, reflecting
portfolio activity, and our effective tax rate was 19.2%.
Turning to slide 10, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue increased $21 million, driven by higher
fee and net interest income, partially offset by lower other non-interest income. Other non-interest income
included negative $128 million of Visa related activity. Net interest income of $3.4 billion increased $108 million or
3%, driven by higher yields on interest earning assets. Fee income was $2 billion and increased $176 million or
10% linked quarter.
Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage income grew $19 million or 5%, reflecting favorable
equity and fixed income market performance. Capital markets and advisory fees increased approximately $100
million or 36%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity, as well as broad growth across most categories.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
Card and cash management decreased $8 million or 1% as higher treasury management revenue was more than
offset by credit card origination incentives. Lending and deposit revenue grew $16 million or 5% due to increased
customer activity. Mortgage revenue was up $50 million linked quarter, driven by a $59 million increase in the
valuation of net mortgage servicing rights.
Other non-interest income of $69 million included Visa derivative fair value adjustments of negative $128 million,
primarily related to Visa's September announcement of a $1.5 billion litigation escrow funding. Notably, we
continue to see strong momentum across our lines of business and throughout our markets. And year-to-date,
non-interest income of $6 billion grew approximately $400 million or 7%, compared to the same period last year.
Turning to slide 11, our non-interest expense of $3.3 billion declined $30 million or 1%. Excluding the second
quarter $120 million contribution expense to the PNC Foundation, non-interest expense increased $90 million or
3% linked quarter.
Personnel expense increased $87 million or 5%, reflecting higher incentive compensation related to increased
business activity. Importantly, all other categories declined or remained stable. Year-to-date non-interest
expenses increased by $80 million or 1%, excluding the $130 million FDIC special assessment and $120 million
Foundation contribution expense in 2024, non-interest expense is down 2% compared to the same period a year
ago.
We remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. We increased our CIP goal last quarter from $425
million to $450 million, and we're on track to achieve that goal in 2024. As you know, this program funds a
significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 12. Nonperforming loans increased $75 million or 3% linked quarter,
primarily driven by an increase in CRE office loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion were stable with June 30.
Net loan charge-offs were $286 million. The $24 million linked quarter increase was driven primarily by lower
commercial recoveries, and our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 36 basis points. Our
allowance for credit losses totaled $5.3 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, stable at June 30.
Slide 13 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. We continue to see stress in the office portfolio,
given the challenges inherent in this book and a lack of demand for office properties. CRE office criticized loans
were essentially stable linked quarter, but NPLs increased due to the migration of criticized loans to
nonperforming status. Net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were down slightly. However, going
forward, we expect additional charge-offs on this book, the sides of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given the
nature of the loans.
As of September 30, our reserves on the overall office portfolio were 11.3% and, inside of that, 16% on the multi-
tenant portfolio, both up slightly from prior quarter. The modest increase in reserves reflects the continued
valuation adjustments across the portfolio and specific reserves for certain credits. Furthermore, CRE office
balances declined 4% were approximately $270 million linked quarter as we continue to manage our exposure
down. Accordingly, we believe we're adequately reserved.
In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting
continued economic growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and
unemployment remains slightly above 4% through year end. We expect the Fed to cut rates two additional times
in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in November and another in December.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable,
net interest income to be up approximately 1%, fee income to be down 5% to 7% due to the elevated third quarter
capital markets and MSR levels, other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million,
excluding Visa activity.
Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable; we expect total non-
interest expense to be up 2% to 3%; and we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $300
million. Importantly, considering our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we're on track to
generate full year positive operating leverage.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Rob, if you could just unpack a little bit of the commentary you made on the swaps. So, I guess, first part of this
question, is I noticed that the receive fixed rate on our asset on your active swaps went up quite a bit quarter-to-
quarter, implying that what's rolling off is well sub-1%. You went from 2.50% to 3.08%, so I'm wondering if you
could confirm that? And looking forward, I think you said something in your prepared remarks about replacing
expiring 2025 swaps at a higher receive fixed rate than you thought. So, maybe just clarify that statement as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, sure. Good morning, Erika. So, yeah, you're right. And again, all of this, in terms of your question, it points to
what is occurring, which is that our repricing of our fixed rate assets, including our securities loans and swaps, is
occurring at higher rates. So, that's all of what we've been talking about for a while. True in terms of the swaps,
new swaps are at a higher rate than the old swaps. And then, as you recall, back in the spring, we did execute
some forward swaps that lock in rates for maturing assets in 2025 that contribute to our statement, which we
might as well confirm upfront, our NII being at record levels in 2025, we're sticking to it.

Got it. Okay. And just the second part of my question, that's the mechanical side, now on the strategic side. Bill,
it's been such a long time since the market has seen a neutral rate of not zero. Everybody has talked about
deposit betas. But as we think about what the natural deposit cost is for PNC, how should we think about what the
spread is? Let's say, we settle at 2.75%, 3% in terms of Fed funds, what's the spread in terms of Fed funds
versus your funding costs naturally?
And additionally, just a quick follow-up to Rob as we're on the liability side of the balance sheet. What drove the
strength in deposits, and was that mostly corporate? And is that permanent balances or is that sort of some
corporate balances just parked for now given the uncertainty in the market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I can't give a specific answer to where we might end up if front rates kind of hold it 3% and change, which I expect
they will. Practically, you can do most of that yourself, right, so the zero cost deposits are obviously worth a lot
more. If there's any steepness to the curve, we get that benefit with our fixed rate assets.
So, maybe inside of your question is, all else equal, if we end up in an environment where front rates are 3% and
change and back rates are somewhat higher than that, that's the really attractive environment for banks,
ourselves included.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And then, the second part of that, Erika, was that the outperformance in our deposit balances came on the
commercial interest-bearing side as commercial clients continue to build cash on their balance sheet. Our
expectation is that will hold, for the most part, through the end of the year.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the loans side, balances are clearly still pressured and you [ph] fly to find (00:20:36) utilization's down a bit to
50.7% and below your historical. Could you maybe talk about the underlying demand trends that you are seeing?
And what do you think is going to be the biggest catalyst to get borrowers off the sidelines and borrowing? Is it
continued rate cuts confidence in that front? Is it the election? If you could just maybe give us some thoughts
there, and what do you think a growth rate is reasonable as you enter 2025? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John. It's Rob. So, yeah, all year, we've yet to deliver the loan growth that we thought was coming at some
future point, and for all the obvious reasons that you've seen, utilization is low. And there is a bit of a pause
feeling, obviously, with the election coming up and the rate environment.
What we point to in terms of on the constructive front is we do continue to add customers. We do continue to add
loan commitments quarter-over-quarter. So, our commercial clients are putting those lines in place with the
anticipation of borrowing. So, that's a constructive sign. And then, you've seen the low inventory levels, the low
CapEx to sales levels. So, it does feel as though we're at the point of the cycle to where loan growth is not too far
off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Got it. Thanks, Rob, for that. And then, separately, capital markets clearly has been a point of strength.
Can you maybe just provide us a little bit of color on the pipeline there? And do you expect a pullback in the fourth
quarter off these high levels? Just how should we think about that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, we do. I'll expand that a little bit in terms of our fee guidance for the fourth quarter. So, we're pointing
to down 5% to 7%. And all of that decline is being driven by the elevated MSR levels and the elevated capital
markets levels that we achieved in the third quarter. So, for the fourth quarter, the MSR is pretty straightforward.
We don't expect to have those levels in the fourth quarter.
And then, on the capital markets side, the short answer is we probably pulled a little bit of the fourth quarter
activity into the third quarter. A lot of that is that our Harris Williams M&A advisory businesses that had a really
strong third quarter, as well as some of the other broader capital markets story. So, it's a little bit lumpy.
The pipelines, though, are strong. The momentum is strong. Capital markets, year-over-year, is up north of 23%.
The back half of 2024, including our capital markets guidance for the fourth quarter, is up 20% over the first half.
So, the momentum's there. It's just not necessarily going to fall linearly quarter-to-quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Guess I wanted to follow-up just a little bit on sort of the
lending and deposit discussion. I guess, first, just kind of qualitatively, do you have a sense for what a lending
recovery might look like when it does come back? And, I guess, the context in that is, I recall a time when the
bank loans used to grow at some multiple of GDP, but it's been quite a while since we've seen that. So, maybe
just some top-level thoughts there?
And then, on the other side of the balance sheet, just maybe your sense for how deposit costs behave, if lending
does come back better? You all, and I think a lot of the industry, are great from a liquidity perspective. So, curious
how much competition factors into your thinking as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We can come up with 10 different theories on why loan growth hasn't been there and what it might come back.
But all of them are me making up theories. It's been below trend on utilization. There's a bunch of uncertainty, not
the least of which is the election and rates and all the other things that may impact it. But it's one of the reasons
why we kind of said, look, we'll produce growth for our shareholders without having to rely on some made-up story
as to why there might be loan growth. If there is, it's terrific, and at some point it'll come back, but I've given up
trying to forecast it personally.
On the funding side, we are very liquid, so we have an opportunity should it arise. We have a lot of capital and
cash, and that would be a great thing for us. I don't – what was the balance at the Fed this quarter?

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Any updated thoughts on where you think your net interest margin normalizes? I think at one point
a couple months ago, you said, it could approach 3%. I think it was by the end of next year. But updated thoughts
on that, given the forward curve and your outlook for the mix with balance sheet? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Matt, it's Rob. I do recall you asking the question before, and the answer is going to be the same,
which is, our NIM is increasing. We don't manage the NIM. It's an outcome. We've operated close to 3%. My
expectation is that we'll approach those levels. I don't remember saying by the end of 2025, but maybe that's
something that you added in. But we're on our way up and 3% is reasonable through time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And actually, maybe it was by the end of 2026, I have my [ph] notes hard to read (00:26:36). And then, just
separately, you've always been very strong in commercial lending and some of the few businesses that come
from that. Consumer side has always been a little bit less of a focus, but I think you've been leaning in areas like
credit card around the edges. And just any updated thoughts in terms of what could be growth drivers as we think
about consumer lending, consumer fees next couple of years? Thanks.

On consumer, yeah. And that's our opportunity set. I don't know that we need to be heroic and be – go beyond
that, but we ought to have the same penetration rate that our peers do with respect to our consumer lending. And
there's fairly material upside should – if we could pull that off, and we're investing to be able to do so.

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks a lot. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your loan growth commentary. You've had a lot of
success over the years in taking share within C&I. If we do get a reacceleration in loan growth over, say, the next
year or so, how does that influence your ability to continue to take share and perhaps outpace industry growth,
recognizing your competitors are obviously not willingly ceding share?

Well, I think that will show up. We are growing DHE and winning new clients at a record pace, I think. So, when
utilization comes back, [ph] we ought to (00:29:24) – as we have in the past, my best guess is we would
outperform.

They're [ph] unfounded (00:29:33) at the moment, but they've been put in place. And I think the most of the
momentum that we see is in our southwest markets where we are achieving record levels and would expect to be
above average if it all plays out as we expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. That's helpful. And then, separately on non-interest-bearing deposits, you expect rates on your interest-
bearing deposits to decline starting next quarter, but how long before you'd expect to see the effect of lower rates
relating to compensating balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, I don't know, that's a tough one to answer. I mean, what we're encouraged about is that we've clearly
stabilized now for a couple of quarters at the levels that we are, following several quarters of pretty substantial
decline. So, we've stabilized. There's a lot of theories in terms of what sort of the magic short-term rate is that
picks that up, but no one has a definitive answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Right. But is the credit that you give customers on compensating balances a sort of lever that you'd expect to use
or be willing to use as you look to grow non-interest-bearing deposits? Just trying to think through whether that's a
potential – something that could spur growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You should assume that crediting rate is below market versus open deposit rate, and so it's not going to have a
moving beta for some period of time relative to rates coming down.

It's relatively constant and we're fine with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Great. And if I could squeeze in one last one. If the NII trajectory that you laid out for 2025 plays out as
anticipated, is there any reason why – the positive operating leverage commentary that you laid out is very
helpful, but any reason why the efficiency ratio wouldn't get down into sort of that high 50% range? Seems like the
math would suggest that that could get there, but we appreciate your thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

Mike Mayo Q

Hi. I think, Bill, your prior comment that you expect record NII in 2025, do you feel more, less or just as confident
as before? And what sort of loan growth do you kind of assume for next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We wouldn't have said it if we didn't feel confident to begin with. So, I don't know levels of confidence, but we feel
pretty good about it.

Robert Q. Reilly A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, we will have something, but the record NII level is not reliant on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, it's not dependent on loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, back – I know – I think last quarter, you used the word befuddled as to why loan growth wasn't
coming back. I guess, number one could be the election; number two could be private credit; number three could
be disintermediation of capital markets; number four, companies could just be managed differently today; or
number five, you could have a weaker economy or it could be all of the above. Just give us your best stab at why
loan growth remains just so weak in an economy that's still growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think all of your reasons other than three and four. I don't think private is causing utilization rate on middle
market companies to remain low for the businesses we play in. And I'm not sure – I mean, at the margin, public
markets being wide open has caused some of our larger clients that pay down outstanding balances and hit the
capital market. So, that's probably true at the margin. But I – this basic notion of people just aren't using working
capital the way they used to, and maybe that's the way they run the company post-COVID, maybe that's the
uncertainty, it's going to play out over time. And we can all guess about it, I just don't know the answer. So, I'm
still befuddled.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, lastly, your reserves on office CRE were taken even higher, especially multi-tenant. Last quarter,
you said the industry's in the first inning. I think a lot of people disagree with that. I'm not saying – I'm not sure –
we're two years into this, at least, and it's still a big question mark, I think, in a lot of people's minds. So, when you
said the industry's in the first inning, and clearly your reserves are higher than others, why do you say it's only the
first inning? What's your reasoning?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think we're just now starting to clear buildings in sales, right? We've had some extensions. We've had maturities
hitting. We have a whole slew of term loans in the CMBS market and with small banks that will be out there three,
four, five, six years. So, I just think this plays out over a long period of time. But office vacancies, pick your
market, are quite high. And we're just now realizing the mark-to-market value of that as we resolve for profits.
That's why we're reserved where we are and that's why I'm not worried about it per se from PNC standpoint, but,
no, this is going to be noisy for a while.

And then, sneaking one more in, last one. As far as acquisitions, I know you'd like to buy them on the cheap. I

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...just one, Rob, for you as a follow-up on deposit pricing. I think fair amount of uncertainty around how much
banks will be able to flex deposit costs lower. We got the September cut. Remind us, one, around your beta
expectations and any early proof points on how customers, and especially commercial customers, have received
the lower rates over the last few weeks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. So, we're early on just a couple of weeks out from the rate cuts. But now, we're in a down beta cycle. We've
said that we think that our terminal data will be approximately 50%, and we will reduce rates paid to the balance
of this year and maybe we get a little bit less than half of the way there by the end of 2024. But that's going to play
out. It's early, but that's sort of our thinking. So, rate paid will be coming down, particularly in the higher interest-
bearing commercial deposits, some wealth deposits, and that's underway, and we'd expect that to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And on commercial clients, so heard you around loan growth and all the reasons why loan growth may or
may not pickup. If you don't mind just speaking to the health of the commercial customer base and whether like
some of the macro data around jobs could be a bit misleading? Like when you talk to your C&I customers, are
they – like are the balance sheets healthy, like do they – if the Fed were to pause rate cuts after a cut or two,
does that increase the risk for these customers and how they might approach investing, hiring, et cetera? Would
love any color you can share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I guess, it – maybe it varies by industry. But a simple notion is companies at the margin are losing margin, right?
They have [indiscernible] (00:39:10) they can't pass on prices the way they want because they're not making it up
in volumes. So, the discussion of how do I cut costs has at least entered the dialogue, but we haven't seen that
show up in layoffs, right. The data remains strong. And as long as the data's strong, consumers are spending,
then the economy's strong. So, everybody's staring and watching and looking and there's margin pressure on
corporates. But there's no – we don't see in conversations some pending big layoff spike hitting the US economy.
There are specific industries that are in slumps, whether it's transportation, healthcare struggling, [ph] consumers
state (00:39:56) at the margin, but that's – it's just at the margin.

Got it. And if – one last one, just following up on Mike's question on M&A, bank transactions usually stock for
stock. Now, why – I mean, your stock has done well. Why would a deal given your history and track record on
deal integration – like is it just completely ruled out at this point? If there's a willing seller acquiring a good
franchise, does it no longer make sense just because of pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, it's – I mean, the fact that we have a multiple advantage, our stock is worth the money it trades at. I'm not
sure other stocks are. So, straight up financial math saying it works doesn't mean it's a good deal. And when we
look at potential targets that would be interesting from certain geographies and so forth, they just don't pencil out
when you look at their balance sheet and the amount of investment we have to put in the franchise, and just the
time sync it takes to do it. So, we – and by the way, we look at everything. I just – I don't think the market's
anywhere close where we'd find something attractive.

Oh, no, there's legs on acceleration certainly in C&I as we continue to buildout these new markets. What you're
going to see us do is more aggressively invest into our retail distribution franchise, very targeted and high-volume
branch builds in particular markets.
At the moment, go back to somebody's question of, hey, what if rates are 3.25% at the front end, what do you
earn on deposits? The breakeven on a branch has become a lot easier to achieve.
And my historical comments on the need for scale are still true. It just looks like the way we're going to have to get
there, at least in the near-term, is through investment in organic growth and we're good at it, we've been
executing on it, and we'll just continue on.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
You guys have done a very good job in managing credit over the years, and it shows up again this quarter. Can
we take a look at, in the C&I portfolio, what are the trends that you guys might be seeing in your – in the [ph]
SNIC (00:43:45) portfolio or the asset-backed portfolio or the leveraged portfolio? The trend's pretty benign. What
are you guys seeing there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Not much. At the margin, we still have more downgrades than upgrades, very simple ratio across that whole book.
Much of that is driven by margin compression, as opposed to anything fundamental with the underlying company.
But now, the economy is healthy and company – and our portfolio is healthy. We'll have lumpy one-offs, there's
always some story that happens, and we had one of those this quarter actually. But overall, the portfolio feels
pretty strong.

Got it. And I know you touched on this on commercial loan growth, about companies might be stronger. Have you

happened during the pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think that almost has to be true. And certainly, part of the answer to the utilization question, by the way, has to
be the notion that, basically, working capital was free for a bunch of years.

And all of a sudden, it got expensive. So, you're looking at places where you could improve margin and you're
trying to cut your borrowings and be more efficient at what you're running in inventory and investments. So,
companies did without a lot of stuff during the pandemic, and you learn from that, and you do try to keep to it. So,
I – we'll see.
But other broader message is the economy's fine, companies are fine. Labor still feels strong. A lot of things in the
geopolitical horizons that could disrupt that, but those are exogenous variables to the basic economy we operate
in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then, just a final follow-up, you gave us some good data, of course, on the commercial real estate
office portfolio. What kind of impact or, I guess, if the cap rates start to come down, when do you start to see that
be beneficial for the commercial – I mean, where it could really help you – help the values of those properties? I
know each property is different, vacancy rates are critical, but is there any kind of point that you guys look at that
if the cap rates fell 100 basis points or 150, that would help the valuation process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, lower cap rates at the margin tends to help. I think what you're running into, though, is you'll have office
buildings that, if they're 50% vacant, they'll hit the market. And the question will be, can they ever get to normal
occupancy through historical absorption rates? And if the answer to that is no, then the value of that building, we
just saw one in New York, is next to zero. If there's a tail on absorption where, yes, I think I can rehab it, and I get
this thing back to my normal 90%, 95%, then it has value as a going concern, and it's worth something. The cap
rate almost is irrelevant in those two scenarios. If the thing is never going to be occupied, it doesn't matter what
the cap rates were if it's worth land.
