Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Julianna. Good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter 2020
earnings call.
Before we go into our financial results, first off, I would like to thank all of our 3,200 associates for their dedication
to providing our customers with seamless service during these unprecedented times. Our team's commitment to
putting our clients first is a true reflection of our values. As a government-designated essential service, we
remained open and our branch associates were out there every day to help customers.
Back in early April, out of 125 locations, we strategically closed 13 branches for the purpose of creating excess
resource capacity as part of our business contingency plan under the pandemic. All branches were opened and
resumed normal hours at the end of June. As an organization, our number one priority is to provide a safe
operating environment for both our associates and our customers. To that end, we adopted all of our locations
with enhanced safety and cleanliness measures. We continue work-from-home plans for non-branch associates
and the transition to remote work has been very successful in terms of productivity. We have developed a detailed
return-to-office plan with gradual phased return for associates.
Now, mindful of our mission to support our customers and communities that we serve through these challenging
times, we funded $1.8 billion of SBA PPP loans during the second quarter for over 7,200 small- to medium-sized
business and nonprofit organizations that cumulatively support over 170,000 employees. The median loan size
that we funded was $60,000 and over 60% of the loans were under $100,000 in size. In addition, over 1,200 of
the customers we provide PPP loans to are new customers for East West Bank.
For East West, the bottom line is that our customers were thriving before this crisis, and that we will help them
through the crisis to thrive again when the pandemic is over. To that end, we offer various payment
accommodations and deferrals for impacted commercial and consumer customers. At the second quarter-end,
8% of our total loans received a COVID-19-related payment deferral. Of these modifications, 90% are three
months deferral, as you can see the details on slide 3.
As of June 30, 2020, only 1% of our C&I loan portfolio was subject to deferral. The deferral rate at the total
commercial real estate portfolio was 10%. Of the $1.6 billion in C&I and CRE loan deferrals, $700 million or 45%
are still making partial payments during the deferral period.
Lastly, the deferral rate of our residential mortgage loans consisting of single-family mortgages and a home equity
line of credit, HELOC, was 14%. You can see from the low weighted average loan to value associated with the
[ph] deferred (00:06:21) loans, which are 53% for CRE and 51% for residential mortgage. Our customers have a

lot of equity in their property. These deferrals have been to our core customers who are committed to maintaining
their homes or projects despite temporary shortfalls in cash flow. The volume of requests for commercial real
estate loan deferrals peaked in May; and for residential mortgage, it peaked in April; for C&I, it has been
idiosyncratic by loan and industry.
Now, I will move on to review our financial condition and the result of this quarter on slide 4 of the presentation.
This morning, we reported second quarter 2020 net income of $99 million or $0.70 per share compared to first
quarter net income of $145 million or $1 per share. Second quarter result include a $102 million provision for
credit losses which negatively impact our net income.
Despite the challenging circumstances, our financial results continued to be solid reflecting the resilience of our
business model, resulting in a return of tangible equity of 9%. In the second quarter, we generated total revenue
of $402 million and earned pre-tax pre-provision income of $249 million, equivalent to a pre-tax pre-provision
profitability ratio of 2.08%.
In the bottom chart of slide 4, you can see that our PTPP income and PTPP profitability ratio have withstood the
steep drop in interest rates with relative stability. At over 2%, our PTPP ratio remains strong and reflects the
fundamental recurring earning power of our franchise, and provides ample cushion to absorb credit costs during
this economic uncertainty. An important variable helping us maintain our pre-tax pre-provision profitability is our
industry-leading low efficiency ratios. In the second quarter, our adjusted operating efficiency ratio was 38.1%.
Let's move on to slide 5 for a summary review of our balance sheet. From an enterprise risk management
perspective, we are navigating this crisis from a position of strength. Our balance sheet is strong. We have high
levels of liquidity and capital, and our loans and deposit portfolios are well diversified. In the second quarter, we
grew total loans by 15% annualized and deposit by impressive 21% annualized.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio as of June 30 was 91.5%, compared to 92.8% as of March 31. The quarter-over-quarter
decrease in the loan-to-deposit ratio reflects the strong deposit growth in the second quarter. Also, our Greater
China balance sheet include loans of $1.2 billion which were down 2% quarter-over-quarter and deposits of $2.2
billion which grew by 7% since March 31. Additionally, we funded the PPP loans through the PPP liquidity facility
by drawing on $1.4 billion, strengthening our already substantial liquidity, and bolstering our balance sheet
capacity to serve our customers.
Turning to slide 6. You can see that East West capital ratios are strong and growing and are some of the highest
among regional banks, particularly for common and Tier 1 equity. Our book value of tangible equity per share
were both up 2% from the prior quarter. Book value at the end of June was $35.25 and tangible equity per share
was $31.86.
You can see from the chart that our risk-based capital ratios, common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, and total
capital, all increased quarter-over-quarter. Our board of directors have declared third quarter 2020 dividends for
the company's common stock. The common stock cash dividend of $0.275 is payable on August 17, 2020 to
stockholders of record on August 4, 2020. We did not do any buybacks during the second quarter.
Now, let's move to slide 7 to have a discussion of our loan portfolio. As of June 30, total loans received a record
$37.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 15% linked quarter annualized. Average loan of $37.1 billion grew by
23% linked quarter annualized. During the second quarter, loan growth came from PPP loans, as well as from our
commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios. Average total CRE loans grew by 11% linked quarter
annualized, and average residential mortgage loans grew by 12% linked quarter annualized.

This mix of growth demonstrates the benefits of East West well-diversified loan portfolio, providing us with the
ability to generate responsible and attractive growth even under challenging economic conditions. As of June 30,
PPP loans were $1.7 billion and the average balance during the second quarter was $1.5 billion. At this point, we
expect forgiveness of PPP loans to begin later in the third quarter, resulting in substantial reductions of these loan
balances before the end of this year.
Excluding PPP, C&I loan balances decreased, payoff were distributed across the C&I portfolio. Recall that at the
end of the first quarter, we saw a run-up in drawdowns from our C&I clients, reflecting market liquidity fears
present at that time. Thanks in part to the sizable federal intervention, liquidity fears subside and some of those
draws reversed. You can see this in the utilization statistics.
As of June 30, our C&I loan utilization was 72%, moderating from 75% three months ago and in line with 71% as
of year-end of 2019. The rate of decrease in our C&I loan portfolio was highest in April and May and moderated in
June. Noticeably, C&I loan pipelines have picked up since June and we are seeing broad-based deal flows from
across our portfolios, including in private equity capital call loans, cross-border business and entertainment.
During the second quarter, we also undertook a vigorous review of our loan portfolio, evaluating credit exposures
for sensitivity to prospective weakening of economic conditions. Through this process, we reviewed over 50% of
our C&I and CRE loans with a particular focus on sectors that are of higher risk during the pandemic, to reduce
focus on [ph] up-to-date (00:15:20) financials and information from our customers, how they were adapting
operations to the pandemic conditions, and what were the sources of stress for them, giving us better visibility into
their current situation.
Overall, many of our customers are in positions of financial strength, have high liquidity, collateral value and
equity, and have made the business changes necessary to adapt to the new environment. However, due to the
shutdowns, some businesses experienced an – the broad impact of the global pandemic on consumer behavior,
we downgraded a small percentage of these loans that we review. Overall, the increase in criticized loans was
primarily from the oil and gas industry. These loan reviews were in addition to our normal loan review practices,
and we will continue this heightened iterative process for the duration of the credit cycle.
Continue on slide 8, we show a detailed breakdown of our C&I loan portfolio. C&I loans excluding PPP were
$11.7 billion as of June 30, or 31% of total loans. As you can see, our portfolio is well diversified by industry. Our
oil and gas exposure as of June 30 was $1.3 billion of loans outstanding and $1.6 billion of total commitment.
From March 31 until July 19, our total oil and gas commitments decreased by 11% following the spring borrowing
base redetermination period, as well as through exits of certain worker loans.
Now within the E&P portfolio, 73% of our E&P clients' oil production is hedged for 2020 and 46% is hedged for
2021. Furthermore, of their gas production, 74% is hedged for 2020 and 61% is hedged for 2021. As of June 30,
2020, the allowance for loan losses coverage of our oil and gas portfolio was 9%. We feel comfortable with this
level of reserve for potential losses, especially in light of current commodity prices which have recovered from
their trough.
Moving on to slide 9, as of June 30, our CRE portfolio was $14.5 billion, equivalent to 39% of total loans. The
portfolio is well balanced across the major property types of retail, multifamily, office, industrial, and hotel. The
geographic distribution of our portfolio generally reflects our branch footprint. And as of June 30, owner-occupied
CRE was $2.2 billion, equivalent to 6% of total loans, or 15% of total CRE loans.

Including unfunded commitments, our total exposure to construction and land loan is small at under $1 billion. Our
construction portfolio is well diversified by property type with a weighted average loan to value of a low 52%
based on total commitment.
You can see on slide 10 that the weighted average loan to value of our total CRE portfolio was 52% with an
average loan size of $2.3 million. Nearly 90% of our CRE loans have an loan to value of 65% of loan. In the chart
on the right, you can see that the weighted average loan to value of our loans are similar by property type.
Our history of consistent underwriting to low loan to value has resulted in low credit losses through many credit
cycles in our income-producing CRE portfolios. Furthermore, a high percentage of our CRE loans have full
recourse and personal guarantees from borrowers who have long-term relationships with East West Bank.
On slide 11 and 12, we provide additional details regarding our single-family residential and HELOC loans.
On slide 11, you can see that the geographic distribution of our single-family residential mortgage portfolio follows
our branch footprint. Our single-family residential mortgages are primarily originated through our East West Bank
branches. The average loan size in our SFR portfolio is only $385,000 and the weighted average loan to value is
53%. More than 90% of our loans have an loan to value of 60% or less. We have a long history of minimal credit
losses from our single-family mortgages.
In the second quarter, we originate a combined $777 million of residential mortgage loans comprising $567 million
in single-family mortgages and $210 million in the home equity lines of credit. The combined second quarter
residential mortgage origination volume increased 6% quarter-over-quarter. Production dipped in April, but
regained pace in May and June. In fact, residential mortgage production in June was the strongest on record for
East West Bank. Contributing factors to the growth were increases in HELOC originations and in refinance
transactions.
In the second quarter, refinance transactions increased to 68% of volume, compared to 62% in the first quarter.
Based on the current pipelines, we expect strong residential mortgage origination volumes for the rest of the year.
On slide 12, you can see the geographic distribution and the loan-to-value distribution of our HELOC portfolio.
Similar to single-family residential mortgage, our HELOC are primarily originated through East West Bank
branches. As of June 30, we have $1.5 billion of HELOCs outstanding, plus $1.6 billion in undisbursed
commitments, translating into a utilization rate of 48%.
At East West, the HELOC we originate are very similar in credit profile to our SFR loans. As of June 30, we're in a
first lien position for 84% of our HELOCs. The average loan size of our HELOC commitment was $362,000 and
the weighted average combined loan to values was only 49%. 97% of our HELOC commitments have a loan to
value of under 60%.
Lastly, I would highlight that the rates of single-family origination have been fairly stable. The weighted average
yield in the second quarter was 4.3% compared to 4.4% in the first quarter. First lien HELOC rates are priced at
the prime rate plus a margin of 50 basis point.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our allowances and asset quality, deposit
and income statement. Irene?

Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. Turning to slide 13 for a review of our allowance for loan losses and slide 14 for a review of
[ph] other (00:23:57) asset quality metrics. Our allowance for loan losses was $632 million as of June 30, or 1.7%
of loans held for investment, compared to $557 million or 1.55% of loans as of March 31. Quarter-over-quarter,
the allowance coverage of the oil and gas portfolio increased by 112 basis points to 9%. The coverage of all other
C&I increased by 28 basis points to 2.6%. And the coverage of CRE increased by 38 basis points to 1.5% driven
by increases in reserves for hotel and retail commercial real estate loans.
During the second quarter of 2020, we booked a $102 million provision for credit losses, compared to $74 million
in the first quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the provision expense was primarily driven by a more
adverse macroeconomic forecast as of June 30, 2020, relative to March 31, as well as loan risk rating
downgrades during the quarter. All else equal, as the macroeconomic outlook stabilizes, we would expect the
provision expense to decrease from current levels.
As you will see on the next slide, excluding oil and gas loans, we are not seeing significant deterioration in our
portfolio by any particular industry or asset class. The low loan to values of our real estate portfolio provide a
buffer against losses, and the rate of deferrals remain manageable. Net charge-offs in the second quarter were
just under $20 million and the net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points of average loans annualized. Charge-offs in
the second quarter were primarily from oil and gas, which accounted for $14 million or 64% of gross charge-offs.
Turning to slide 14. Criticized loans were 3.4% of total loans as of June 30, or $1.25 billion. You can see from the
chart on the slide, that the largest single industry component of our criticized loans are oil and gas loans, nearly
equal size to the criticized loans of all other C&I. Oil and gas loans made up 24% of our special mention loans
and 41% of our classified loans as of June 30.
Special mention loans were 1.5% of total loans as of June 30, or $576 million. This ratio was stable quarter-over-
quarter. 11% of our oil and gas loans were graded special mention as of June 30, up from 5% as of March 31. For
all other C&I, CRE, and residential mortgage loans, the special mention ratio was essentially stable quarter-over-
quarter.
Classified loans were 1.8% of total loans as of June 30, in the amount of $674 million compared to a ratio of 1.2%
as of March 31. The quarter-over-quarter increase in classified loans was largely driven by downgrades of oil and
gas loans. The classified percentage of our oil and gas loans was 22% as of June 30, up from 4% as of March 31.
For all other C&I loans, the classified loan ratio improved from 2.3% to 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. Outside of oil
and gas, the rest of our C&I loan portfolio remained stable, as evidenced by these asset quality ratios, as well as
by the low deferral rate of our C&I loans.
The classified loan ratio for commercial real estate was 1.4% as of June 30, up from 0.7% as of March 31. The
largest inflow into classified commercial real estate in the second quarter were from office and retail CRE
segments. The classified ratio of residential mortgages was essentially stable quarter-over-quarter.
Nonaccrual loans were 48 basis points of total loans, or $179 million as of June 30. The quarter-over-quarter
increase was largely due to inflows of nonaccrual status of oil and gas and commercial real estate loans, partially
offset by payoffs and charge-offs of C&I loans. Lastly, accruing loans 30 to 89 days past due were 30 basis points
of total loans, or $113 million as of June 30.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Now, moving on to slide 15 for a discussion of deposits. Total deposits grew to a record $40.7 billion as of June
30, 2020, an increase of $2 billion or 21% linked quarter annualized. Average deposits of $39.9 billion grew $2.4
billion, or 26% linked quarter annualized. Growth in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits was $2.4 billion
quarter-over-quarter, or an impressive 87% linked quarter annualized. Average DDAs increased to 34% of total
deposits in the second quarter, up from 30% in the first quarter.
Average deposit growth in the second quarter was driven by strong growth from consumer and small business
commercial customers, as well as from PPP funds held in deposit accounts, partially offset by intentional runoff of
higher-cost deposits. We attribute this growth to customers choosing to remain very liquid in this environment and
to lower levels of business spending during these shutdown periods. While we expect customer liquidity to remain
elevated during the course of the pandemic, we also expect balances to trend down as business and consumer
activity resumes.
During the second quarter, we also intentionally reduced some higher-cost deposits giving the strong growth in
deposits. The average total cost of deposits was 47 basis points in the second quarter and the spot rate as of
June 30 was 39 basis points. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 71 basis points in the second
quarter and the spot rate as of June 30 was 59 basis points.
We expect to continue to decrease deposit costs for the rest of the year from the repricing downward of maturing
CDs, as well as from further runoffs of higher-cost balances. As of June 30, spot rate on domestic CDs was
1.08%. Further maturities of CDs with the interest rate over 1% are $2 billion in the third quarter at a blended rate
of 1.56%; $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter at a blended rate of 1.45%; and $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021 at
a blended rate of 1.26%. For context, the blended rate of CD originations and renewals in the second quarter was
43 basis points.
And now, moving on to a discussion of our income statement starting with slide 16. I will share highlights not
discussed in detail elsewhere during this presentation on this slide. We purchased investment securities during
the market dislocation earlier in the quarter and sold $132 million of municipal bonds for a gain on sale of $10
million. We also prepaid $150 million of repo liabilities to help improve our future funding costs, incurring a debt
extinguishment cost of $9 million during the second quarter. The effective tax rate was unchanged at 12% for both
the second and the first quarter.
Moving on to slide 17 for a discussion of our net interest income and net interest margin. Second quarter 2020 net
interest income of $344 million decreased by $19 million or 5% linked quarter, and the net interest margin of
3.04% compressed by 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Second quarter net interest income included $21
million of PPP loan income, net of interest expense on the PPPLF. Excluding this PPP-related income, second
quarter net interest margin was 2.96%. The changes in the net interest income and the net interest margin reflect
a quarter-over-quarter drop in the average prime and LIBOR rates.
31% of our loan portfolio is tied to LIBOR, predominantly the one-month rate, and 27% of our loan portfolio is tied
to prime. Accordingly, the average loan yields in our portfolio compressed by 73 basis points quarter-over-quarter
to 3.98% in the second quarter, from 4.71% in the first quarter. Against the backdrop of materially lower interest
rates, declines in earning asset yields were partially offset by decreases in the cost of funds.
The quarter-over-quarter change in our net interest margin is as follows: 65-basis-point decrease from lower loan
yields, 10-basis-point decrease from lower yields on other earning assets, an 8 basis points decrease from
balance sheet mix shift, all of which were partially offset by a 35-basis-point increase from lower funding costs

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
and a positive impact of 8 basis points from PPP. We expect that our net interest margin, excluding the variability
from recognition of PPP loan fees, will stabilize around current levels in the neighborhood of 3%.
Our loan portfolio has largely already repriced and the repricing was front-loaded into the second quarter. The
yields on residential mortgage loan originations have been more resilient to rate compression. And as Dominic
mentioned, loan pipelines are rebuilding which will continue and contribute to a favorable earning asset [ph] remix
(00:33:55). We expect to continue to improve our cost of deposits with the downward repricing of CDs to current
market rates as well.
Now turning to slide 18. Total noninterest income in the second quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million
in the first quarter. The income and net gains on sales of loans were $52 million in the second quarter, down by
$2 million or 4% quarter-over-quarter. This decrease reflects lower customer transaction volume across several
fee income lines of business. In other fee income categories, lending fees of $22 million in the second quarter
increased by $6 million primarily due to increase in the valuation of warrants received as part of lending
relationships.
Moving on to slide 19. Second quarter noninterest expense was $188 million, an increase of 5% linked quarter.
Excluding debt extinguishment cost for the repos, amortization of tax credit and other investments, and the core
deposit intangible amortization, our adjusted noninterest expense was $153 million in the second quarter, a
decrease of 5% quarter-over-quarter, and a decrease of 4% year-over-year.
The largest linked-quarter change was a $5 million decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense,
followed by a $2 million decrease in other operating expenses, and a $2 million decrease in legal expense.
Notable decreases in other operating expenses include marketing promotion expenses and travel expenses.
Our second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 38.1%. Over the past five quarters, our efficiency ratio has
ranged from 37.7% to 38.5%. As an organization, we remain committed to controlling expenses across the board.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.

[indiscernible] (00:37:25) Dominic, thanks for going through all the details on credit. But if you could just spend
some more time there after the review that you talked about, can you talk to us just in terms of the downside risks
to your reserve levels when we think about, one, the energy portfolio. We saw one of the banks take a 50% mark
and sell some of these loans. So, if you could address your energy book in the context of that.
And then also on the CRE book, like, if the 50%, 55% LTVs which looked relatively low, are those a good kind of
buffer when we think about certain hospitality properties that may never recover from this pandemic. Give us a
sense of your comfort around both of those portfolios, if you could, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. First, on the oil and gas, when you – we – I mean, I can't really comment much about Hancock Whitney
because our portfolio quite different to a certain extent and why the motivation of selling at such a steep discount.
We'd done pretty much most of our spring redetermination. We do not see the type of deficiency like – that will be
causing us to wanted to take this kind of massive discount. And basically, we are going through just loan by loan.
And looking at the current situation and most updated financial information, and the engineering reports from the
spring redetermination and come up with the reserve that is needed, we feel that we have very adequate – very
adequately cover our oil and gas portfolio as of today with the 9% of reserve coverage. So, we feel pretty good on
that. And we have appropriately classified the loans that need to be classified and so forth.
Now, let's go to the CRE. Yes, the 50-some-odd-percent loan to value is very – I think is very good in terms of as
a cushion to help against losses. We have 30, 40 years of history at East West in many different credit cycles that
year in and year out when it comes to income-producing properties, the low loan to value makes a big difference.
I think for the hotels, it also add that we are doing business with hotel operators that are very experienced in this
trade, and these are high-quality operator and also many of them have substantial liquidity. Many of them also
have put in their personal guarantee. So yes, there are some hotels that is going to be having some challenge
because of the current pandemic that causing the occupancy rate dropping very low. But the fact is, so far, what
we have seen is that some of these hotels have gradually reopened.

I know that there are going to be always some setback with certain state and certain cities that may have to shut
down for a brief period of time. Eventually, the economy has to open up. We just have to find ways to protect
ourselves while still working. So, I would expect that some of these hotels will gradually still open back up. And we
do have our borrowers who have more liquidity and have their personal financial net worth at stake that I think will
be substantially more motivated.
So, from that standpoint, we want to look at pretty much almost all of the hotel loans. And we do feel pretty
comfortable right now that we have more than adequate reserve to cover the commercial real estate portfolio.

Jared Shaw Q

Hi. Good morning. I guess for the first question sticking with credit, when we look at some of the most troubled, I
guess, CRE loans whether that's hotels or retail or restaurants, how are you looking at sort of the long-term
resolution of that? Should we assume that those just stay on sort of a continued deferral that's allowed under the
CARES Act, or would you expect to see more of an active restructuring of the most troubled loans before year-
end and try to get them onto a new system or a new structure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, first of all, I think that, as I mentioned earlier, over 90% of our payment deferrals are actually only three
months. So based on our conversation with the customers, the one that request the deferral really don't anticipate
that they would need another three months or six months deferral and so forth, at this stage. [ph] While granted
(00:43:03) some of them have support from PPP loans, so we'll have to see whether beyond the PPP, what the
stimulus package that may be coming from the government or maybe some of them possibly qualify for the Main
Street Lending Program and so forth.
So, there are many different sources of support, but all in all, when I look at particular for the hotel and some of
the retail customers when we go through loan by loan, so many of them did not even ask for payment deferral.
Keep in mind though, vast majority, if you look at it, only 10% of our CRE customer asked for payment deferral,
the vast majority of our customers don't even need that because they have their personal liquidity or for whatever
reason, the nature of that particular income-producing property allow them to still have enough cash flow to
service their debt. And that's the beauty about having first trust deed low loan-to-value loan because the mortgage
payment for P&I combined are not as taxing as those what I call conventional borrowers who borrow 70%, 75%
and struggling a little bit.
So, I think from that standpoint that there's no question that we're going to have a few more customers potentially
may have to come back due to whatever various reason that we have to do, maybe somewhat of a additional
modification, and we'll work with them one by one. But at this stage right now, I think, overall, it's looking pretty
good for us.

Thanks. And then, on the C&I loan pipeline, last quarter, you seemed I guess a little more cautious on growth.
This quarter, it sounds like the pipelines are starting to boost again. How are you looking at underwriting in this

environment? And I guess what's the – what do you view as the opportunity for near-term C&I growth as we finish
up the year here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think ever since – in fact, ever since late January, when the pandemic first happened in Wuhan, we have
implement internally the COVID-19 review. Every single loan that we approved had to go through the – sort of like
evaluation about how does COVID-19 affect this particular business so that in addition to looking at the, like, for
example, like, back in February and March or so, in addition, just looking at the financial statement as of 12/31,
and then everything looks fine and dandy, we look at the situation as it and say that, hey, with the pandemic, how
would this business going to be able to carry on in the next 6 months, 12 months; do they have enough liquidity to
get by; are they in a business that actually are benefiting from the pandemic because they're in the e-commerce
business or they are in some type of business. They are making face mask that actually are helping them.
So, we look at all of the different factors. Or if there's something that is positive, to what extent this positivity can
only last for six months and so forth. So, we look at all of those different factors to determine that the credit
worthiness and making sure that we do not go in here now and going to make a loan using a formula pre-COVID-
19 and then end up getting ourself in more problem a few months down the road.
So, that's the kind of a vigor that we use. And so far, I think that we find business that we are able to sort of, like,
bring in as new customers. And we also have existing customers now start going back and doing more business,
and we continue to support this type of endeavors.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. I guess my first question for Irene. Can you just help us understand the benefit of the PPP loans
this quarter because if I look at the math, you have $1.7 billion of loans but you have $21.3 million of fees or
income which kind of amounts to about a 5% annualized yield, which seems a bit high. Help us understand that,
please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. I'd be delighted to do that for you. So, if you look at the $21 million of PPP-related loan income, that is the
one part of it is the 1% that we're accruing; and additional, we estimated what we thought the life would be for the
PPP loans, loan by loan. And based on that, we have accreted part of that fee income during the quarter. So, the
combination of that is the $21 million.
So, I'll break that down for you. The amount that we accreted was about $17.5 million in the second quarter. So,
we're estimating that that the life of the loans will be shorter than the contractual periods which, for us, is generally
two years in total for some of the loans. Some of them just based on the activity and what we're seeing and what
we know about the customers, we are assuming that they'll go through the full contractual life of the two years
plus

Got it. So in essence, that if you assume a loan has, say, a six-month life and you got 3% fee on that loan, you're
basically taking the entire 3% fee over the six-month period. Is that the right way to understand that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, okay. And if I can just speak sort of a second question, just in terms of provision expense, Irene, you did
mention that provision expense should decline, which I think we all generally agree provision expense should
decline if there's no further deterioration to your macroeconomic assumptions. But is there anything unique about
East West that would lead that provision to decline a little bit less or more or – I'm just trying to get a magnitude of
whether it goes from $100 million down to $80 million, or $100 million down to $20 million, if there's no further
deterioration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. I don't know – if you look at it portfolio by portfolio, I don't know if there are any kind
of unique characteristics. And that's why our – relative to others with the same macroeconomic environment, we
use Moody's, the baseline, as the backbone of our allowance calculation, would be that different from other banks
quite frankly.
I do think kind of in continuation of the comments that we've made as far as the resiliency of our customers,
income-producing commercial real estate, the reviews that we've done, the single-family customers, the amount
of equity that they have, those are portfolios I'm very confident that ultimately the loss content will be reasonable –
reasonably low relative to others. But I don't know if aside from the oil and gas which we've talked about we see
anything really systemic at this point.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that point, Irene, just sort of the C&I portfolio.
I think you've got a little over 2% reserve on the remaining loans ex oil and gas. Can you talk about what areas
you are watching more closely in there, whether it be entertainment and what's in that bucket, or tech and life
sciences. Or are there other things that we should be keeping an eye out for as it does seem like those might be
the higher loss given the following areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Candidly speaking, I think we are looking at all the portfolios. Especially with the pandemic, the concerns,
the cash flows, the different circumstances are very different than before the pandemic. So we're looking at as far
as what's happening with our business, what's the cash flow, strength of the guarantors and the borrowers as
well. From an allowance perspective, specifically, I don't think that aside from oil and gas, if you look at industry
by industry, there's anything very unique with how much [ph] we reserved (00:52:15). There are certain portfolios,
13


East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
for example, we have a equipment leasing portfolio, it's a longer life, the amount of reserve for that is higher. But
aside from that, I wouldn't say that there's anything very unique industry wise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And this one may be a bit of a [indiscernible] (00:52:34) question, but kind of just bigger picture on what's
going on with Hong Kong right now, China and US rhetoric ratcheting up again. Are there any things that we
should be thinking about relative to kind of the Hong Kong specific or China mainland operations that could flow
back through to East West if things were to deteriorate there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think on the Hong Kong situation, let me just maybe see if we can break it out into a few different scenario,
let's just say the worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario will be, let's say, that US government order all US
banks to retreat back to US and no longer allowed to be doing business or no longer allowed to have offices in
Hong Kong or something like that. That's what I look at as the worst-case scenario.
Well, keep in mind that we have, so far as of today, only 3% of our loans are in Greater China region. So, for
example, you look at $37 billion of loan outstanding today, only $1.2 billion is in Greater China, that's even
including Hong Kong. So, you kept that – half of that in Hong Kong knowing that – China and Hong Kong
combined, half of that in Hong Kong. So, we like talking about less than 1.5% or so of our total loan portfolio. And
if you look at our history, for the last 13 years in Hong Kong, the loss rate, delinquency, nonperforming asset and
so forth has been extraordinary low.
So, as of today, if we look at what's been happening, Hong Kong went through the pandemic for six months, and
we had no losses. So, I feel pretty good that if we end up just having to all come back home, we're talking about a
revenue risk, it's very minimal. We, obviously, just last quarter grew our loans by 15% annualized. So, there's
really no reason for us to worry about a 1.5% loan reduction. So, we feel pretty good about even if the worst-case
scenario, we're not going to have any losses or we're going to – and on top of revenue risk, we can get it covered.
But that is an extremely, extremely unlikely scenario because I looked at it, Hong Kong in 1997 when there was
the handover of Hong Kong from the British government to China after 99 years of Hong Kong being colonized by
England. And the fact is everyone in 1997 was concerned about that was the end of Hong Kong. Singapore had
picked up a lot of business. Vancouver, Toronto, Sydney to Melbourne, all picked up new business. And everyone
think that everyone's going to be gone and no longer – Hong Kong is no longer going to be viable.
I didn't think so. I was there at the handover ceremony, had some discussion with many different business leaders
around the world. And while some of them had pessimistic view, there are many other have optimistic view at the
end of the day. Since 1997, Hong Kong have done extraordinarily well. And so from my perspective is that, the
more likely scenario is that we're going to have to see some noises within the next 12 to 24 months, and Hong
Kong will be different in the standpoint of now there may be not as much the business that Hong Kong is currently
doing like – that will be doing in the future, but they're connecting with the Greater Bay of China, the southern
provinces of China connecting to Hong Kong is going to create enormous amount opportunity for Hong Kong.
If you look at [ph] Ant Financial (00:56:55) [indiscernible] (00:56:54) a few of these over $100 billion are potential
IPO. There'll be more and more of those going to Hong Kong. So Hong Kong is still going to have a place. And if I
look at our existing customers for the last several months, by the way, most of them actually have their business
headquartered in the British Virgin Islands and then a type of entity anyway. And they were navigating through
14


East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
this challenging time in Hong Kong just fine. And we are continuing to work with private equity funds [audio gap]
(00:57:36) for them to move to Singapore and then other places, it will be very easy.
So, I don't think that there will be that big of a challenge from a business point of view. But there's no question,
there's no question that the political noise will continue to be a major distraction because no matter what if every
day that you read the newspaper, what you see is the headline news about something terrible happening in Hong
Kong and so forth, it does have a perception risk there that we have to recognize. But as you have seen so far for
the last two or three years, whether in China on the tariff situation, East West navigate through the last three
years with this heavy US-China political bash regarding the tariff, and somehow we navigate through and have
very minimal losses and continue to be able to maintain our business and going forward.
And we're going to be nimble and we're going to be pretty flexible. And whenever there is some business caused
by the political risk that we should no longer engage, we move forward to other business that is appropriate for us
to do. And I wanted to do – highlight one other thing is that as all these political rhetorics that's going on for the
last few years, in fact, in the last six months, it intensified substantially. And I would expect that there will be 3
more – 3.5 more months to go before it subside.
And with these political rhetorics that is going on, US investment in China for the last six months actually had
increased. The media don't talk about it much, but if you look at the true statistics, foreign direct investment from
United States to China have actually increased. Business folks still see the potential of still investing in China. In
fact, China is still welcoming US business. As you can see what they have done for Tesla or JPMorgan,
Mastercard, I mean, they continue to welcome US business to China, and those business are continue to taking
advantage of those new licenses they were able to acquire or the new acquisition they can make. And so, it's a
very interesting dynamic in terms of the political rhetorics versus what's happening in terms of the day-to-day
business.
And East West Bank are apolitical. We stay neutral and we're focusing on taking care of our business, our clients.
And we know how to manage risk because we understand the space very, very well. So, so far so good. So, we
will continue to do what we need to do in terms of managing the overall risk profile of this US-China relationship
and move accordingly in a prudent manner. So, I feel pretty comfortable that we're able to find a way to keep
doing well, and it's something that I have plenty of discussion with our board of directors in regarding with this
situation.
Again, I think that since Nixon's normalized relationship with China, and US government policy have always been
seek common ground and reverse – reserving differences, that's been the policy for a few decades, and the last
few months have been quite differently. But I don't think that this sort of like very, very hostile type of relationship
can sustain and at some point of time, in my long-term view, it will normalize again and then things will get better.

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, efficiency – I mean, I think I said it before, efficiency ratio is just a – sort of the revenue [ph] of income
(01:02:34) minus expenses. So, there's not much to it. I just basically work with our associate and then I tell them
that, hey, we – I mean, don't take any losses but then book as many loans as you can, and then bring in all these
good low-cost deposits, and so that generate some meaningful – like a net interest income and then get more fee
income, core fee income and then control the expenses, and then something good will come out.
And then my definition of something good come out is that these high-30s, low-40s kind of numbers, and that's it.
That's all we – that's what we focus on. And then I don't really, really get into that much about we have a target
anything like that, I just – we just make sure we do the right thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Great. Maybe I could ask one more on the expenses. You guys have, I think, done a great job
adjusting to the revenue environment by slowing the expense growth. I guess two-part question. The lower
expenses, the core expenses this quarter, was there any benefit from the PPP program, the originations? And
two, how do we think about just investments in this kind of environment, the pace of investments into 2021?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Chris, this is Irene. I'll take that. Yes, there was a benefit during the quarter for loan costs that were deferred. Our
gross fees are roughly $50 million in the quarter. We deferred about $7 million of the loan cost fees associated
with the origination of the PPP loans. On a go-forward basis, if you look at the pace of investment, we have
actually many very exciting investments and projects underway to help our customers improving our systems, our
platforms, the digital onboarding. Those investments started before the pandemic and are underway, just to share
– well underway rather.
We're implementing a new online banking system for Hong Kong and that will integrate our US online banking
and our Hong Kong online banking. We're also implementing a new global FX system. And we also have many
smaller projects underway to improve digital onboarding end-to-end processes. I think with the pandemic, the
investments that we have been and continue to make in these areas are perhaps maybe even more important.
So, to a certain extent, these are things that we're continuing to do, have started before, and we'll continue to do.
And in a way, many of these will also help us as far as the efficiency and the productivity of our teams and our
ability to continue to serve our customers without adding on as much incremental cost.

Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Got it. And then for my second question, you guys had mentioned pipelines were building in June in commercial.
And you mentioned a few industries there, was just wondering if you could just talk about what's driving that build
if you're taking share in those areas or if you're hearing more confidence or any positive sentiment amongst
commercial customers. And then I guess, on the flip side, in the rest of the C&I book, is the expectation that you'll
have some more paydowns in energy and maybe see an unwind of some of those draws from the first quarter as
we go through the back half of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. For the pipeline that we are beginning to see in June, in fact, we start booking some of these loans now in
July. In PE, private equity, those are just traditional capital call lines and mainly existing customers that have new
funds, so much distress situation going around the world. There are more people now, I mean, just like putting in
substantial amount of liquidity and start new funds to capitalize on these opportunities. And we have these very,
very strong borrowers that are starting new funds, coming to us and we are able to actually start booking some of
these private equity capital call line business. We just happen to be picking up some more, I think, for the last few
weeks versus in the second quarter, when people need to just time out and size up what's going on.
And on the entertainment side, I think our team just being very diligent while staying at home, but dialing the
phone nonstop with the studio executives and then getting these deals that we are able to finance. And again,
very strong collateral support type of deals and things that we sort of like without any question to be more than
happy to jump into this kind of type of transaction and even during the pandemic. So, we feel very good about it,
these kind of opportunities.
And the third category that I thought we saw some nice pickup [ph] our (01:10:48) cross-border business. Keep in
mind that in the first and second quarter, Hong Kong and China have taken a more draconian type of
measurement against – in terms of, I would say, discipline on fighting the pandemic. Both of them have been
extraordinarily successful.
But with that, I think that obviously business been somewhat shut down in a big way. So they weren't having as
much business as you – as we indicated in the second quarter of – no, second quarter, we actually have $2
million, the 2% reduction of our Greater China loan portfolio. But they started getting back business as usual,
business as normal both in Hong Kong and China. And so, our teams in Greater China are picking up some more
business. We feel that there is more opportunities there.
And same thing for the cross-border team in United States. Frankly, when everybody look at US-China as
something that they don't want to get anywhere close to, if someone just look very hard and deep, they can
always find some golden opportunity in there. And we're trying to make sure that we do the best we can to
capitalize on some of these remaining good opportunity.
So at this point, we see these three industry verticals may have some pretty good traction for now. I mean, but
still, we are in July and still early, so we don't know what the next two months will be like, we'll see. But at this
point, it looks pretty promising.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. First question is on credit and the provision. You mentioned about how it could be lower if the macro
environment remains stable. I was curious if the stimulus bill being contemplated is delayed to late August or
September, would that change your economic forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I don't know if just the stimulus bill being delayed would change the economic forecast. Certainly, if it impacts the
expectation – a lot of the drivers for our forecast, some of the – there are many drivers, but for us if you look at it,
GDP growth, unemployment; and then to a certain extent for single-family, the housing starts numbers. So those
are the things that drive it the most, but certainly, I would say that if the bills are delayed and that impacts the
expectation around these key metrics, that that would have an impact, but not just by itself.

David John Chiaverini Q

Okay. Thanks for that. And separately, anecdotally, it appears more retail stores are becoming vacant. I was
curious, do you know how much of your CRE borrowers no longer have tenants?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well. We actually went through the CRE retail customers' loan review. As I said, we review over 50% of these
CRE loans in a loan-by-loan review basis and getting the most current information. Our relationship manager
actually have the most updated information for the customers. Every one of them have a – maybe a little bit
unique situation. We have some that have maybe 30% of the tenants have to – cannot pay full rent. And we have
some that actually have a few of the tenant just say that I'm out. And then there were others that are still paying
us and really fully occupied. So, every one of them are a bit different.
For a few of them that may have some more severity in terms of tenant not paying, somehow the borrowers have
strong financial ability to continue to carry the payment and knowing that eventually he will be able to find a way to
release it to some other new tenants down the road. So, it just a multiple different scenario. But one thing we do
know is that because we went through this review loan by loan, we know exactly what the situation is and we
know what the stress situation is currently.
And at this stage, we feel pretty good and comfortable about the portfolio where it stand today. And we feel that
we absolutely, from a CRE point of view, we have more than adequate reserve to cover any potential losses.

I'd also just like to add. A lot of the comments Dominic made were about tenants and their payments, and
especially given in light that many of the stores are closed, specifically as it relates to occupancy of the buildings,
most of – as we went through these loan reviews, the occupancy pre-pandemic was pretty high on most of the
properties. Most of them were fully occupied.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, thanks. Just an accounting question here. I noticed there was a negative provision in single-family residential
in the quarter. Could you kind of give some color around that, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The slight negative provision in single-family, it's very modest in many ways, but the results – the reason for
that was the allowance that was required did reduce slightly from the forecast that we used at the end of March to
our forecast as of the end of June that we use for our June allowance close. It was really driven by the less
severe impact for housing prices, with the HPI improving over the prior forecast.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. Okay. And did I understand correctly that the next major cliff of deferral expiries is August?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Based on – so I'll categorize the deferrals. We have the big groups as far as the commercial deferrals and
then also the single-family. Single-family, a little earlier; for the commercial deferrals, it is August and September.
Most of those will come up in a way then.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

call back over to Dominic for any closing remarks.
