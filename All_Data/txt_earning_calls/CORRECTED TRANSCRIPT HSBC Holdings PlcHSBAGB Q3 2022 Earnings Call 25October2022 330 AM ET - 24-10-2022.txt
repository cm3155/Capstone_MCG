MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analyst Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings plc's Q3 2022 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'll hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive. You may begin, sir.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you and good morning in London. Good afternoon in Hong Kong. Thank you for joining our third quarter
results call. Ewen is going to lead the financial presentation, but I want to start by first talking about the leadership
changes we've also announced.
We've now spent nearly three years transforming HSBC. And while there's still work to do, we are now in a much
better place to accelerate our financial performance and deliver stronger returns. As we approach the end of our
three-year transformation program, myself and the board have taken the opportunity to review the composition of
the GEC with an eye to long-term succession planning.
As a result, we have today announced that Georges Elhedery will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer on
the 1st of January 2023 and Greg Guyett will take on the role of CEO of GB&M permanently, effective
immediately.

Ewen will, therefore, step down as Group CFO on the 31st of December and will leave the bank in April 2023. I
want to put on record my thanks to Ewen for everything he's done during his time with us. He played a key part in
creating and executing our transformation and growth agenda over the last four years. He helped steer HSBC
through the COVID pandemic. He has been fundamental in reshaping our portfolio globally, improving our capital
efficiency and embedding disciplined cost management across the organization. He has also driven the
transformation agenda within the finance function, reshaping the strategic direction, encouraging innovations and
building the team's engagement levels. He has been a great professional, has contributed much to the bank and I
wish him the very best for his future career.
I want to emphasize, we remain absolutely committed to delivering our strategy and the 2023 targets we
announced with our Q2 results. There is no change to my commitment as a consequence of these people moves.
Turning to Q3, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance. All regions performed well with particularly good
performances in the UK, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. We delivered a double-digit return on tangible
equity for the nine-month period, excluding significant items. And we remain on track to achieve our financial
targets in 2022 and 2023. We've also kept a tight grip on costs and are driving greater efficiencies across the
organization.
Clearly, this is important in an unpredictable and challenging external environment, but it's also a sign that our
digitization strategy is working. Our work to structurally reposition the business and invest in areas of growth
continues to gain traction. We are in a much better position at the start of the new interest rate cycle as a result of
the actions we have taken on capital efficiency, portfolio rationalization, organic revenue generation and cost
control.
We can also see in Wealth, for example, that we're building a strong earnings platform for the future. Over the last
12 months, we attracted $91 billion of net new invested assets, with $32 billion in the third quarter alone. Really, I
expect you to ask about M&A activity when we get to the Q&A section of today's call. As a result, we've given
some more information about our Canada business in the appendix.
I'll now hand over to Ewen to take you through the details.

Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon all. As Noel said, these are a good set of results. Reported pre-tax
profits in the quarter, $3.1 billion, while down on last year's third quarter, this was due to the $2.4 billion revenue
impairment associated with the disposal of our French retail bank. Adjusted pre-tax profits in the quarter
increased by $1 billion or 18% to $6.5 billion, reflecting a strong net interest income performance of $8.6 billion.
That's up $2 billion on last year's third quarter.
We had higher ECLs this quarter, $1.1 billion or 43 basis points. This primarily reflects increased economic
uncertainty in the UK, together with further provisioning for our China commercial real estate portfolio. Operating
expenses are up 1% year-to-date against the same period last year and up 5% on last year's third quarter due to
higher technology investment and different timings for our variable pay accrual. We remain on track to deliver
broadly stable costs this year.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Our core Tier 1 ratio was down 20 basis points to 13.4%, including an around 30-basis-point impact from the loss
on the French retail bank disposal. We continue to expect to be at the bottom end of our 14% to 14.5% target
core Tier 1 range during the first half of 2023.
At our second quarter results, Noel and I said our current strategy is the best and safest way to improve returns
with strong revenue growth driven by rising rates and volumes and tight cost discipline. With these results, our
strategy remains firmly on track, good underlying growth across all of our businesses with operating costs
remaining broadly stable year-to-date and an annualized reported return on tangible equity of 9.2%.
Adjusted revenue was up $3.1 billion or 28% as the positive impact of rate rises was reflected in our strong net
interest income performance and noninterest income of $5.7 billion was up $600 million or 13% on last year's third
quarter despite a $400 million insurance market impact charge in the quarter. ECLs were $1.1 billion net charge
compared to a net release of $600 million in last year's third quarter. We now expect an ECL charge of around 30
basis points for this year.
Lending was down 2% on the second quarter and deposits down 1%, but excluding the impact of the
reclassification of the French retail bank as held for sale, lending and deposits were both up $5 billion. Our
tangible net asset value per share of $7.13 was down $0.35 on the second quarter due to negative FX and
adverse fair value movements.
Turning to slide 4, we're seeing good organic growth across all of our global businesses as well as the benefit of
rising rates. Wealth and Personal Banking revenue was up 25% with a good Personal Banking performance.
Personal Banking revenues were up $1.4 billion on the third quarter last year due to higher rates and balance
sheet growth. There was a good underlying performance in Wealth due to the strong insurance and private
banking performance, while revenue is down 9% or $200 million due to adverse market impacts in insurance of
$400 million.
We remain very confident in the growth of our Wealth franchise. We had $91 billion of net new invested assets in
the last 12 months, including almost $32 billion in this quarter. So, our investment is building a strong future
earnings platform.
Commercial Banking revenue was up 40%, with Global Payments Solutions, formerly known as GLCM, benefiting
from higher rates together with continued strong underlying growth. Global Banking and Markets revenue was up
16%. Market and Securities Services (sic) [Markets and Securities Services] (00:09:27) revenue was up 20% due
to market volatility. And Global Payments Solutions in Global Banking up 100%, partly offset by lower Capital
Markets and Advisory activity.
On slide 5, net interest income was $8.6 billion, up $2 billion versus last year's third quarter. This was primarily
driven by higher rates and was strong across all regions and businesses. On rates, the net interest margin was
157 basis points, up 22 basis points on the second quarter, putting us back at pre-pandemic levels. We now
expect net interest income of around $32 billion for this year and at least $36 billion in 2023 compared to the
previous $37 billion guidance.
Relative to the second quarter, we are upgrading our assumptions on a like-for-like 2023 revenues by around
$1.5 billion on a constant currency basis, including $1.2 billion for FX movements and at least $1.3 billion of
planned higher cost of funding for the trading book, with this benefit being reflected in higher trading income, in
noninterest income and as dollar for dollar with lower net interest income.

In addition, given the unprecedented speed of interest rate rises we've been seeing this year, we believe we're
being cautious on our planning assumptions across deposit features, deposit migration and asset margins from
here.
The FX movements have a similar impact on costs with 2021 adjusted operating costs of $32 billion, translating to
around $30 billion using year-to-date average FX rates and around $29 billion if you were to use September
average rates. Given the slower growth we now foresee, we now expect low-single-digit lending growth in both
2022 and 2023 before returning to previous expectations of mid-single-digit growth from 2024 onwards.
On the next slide, noninterest income was $5.7 billion, up 13% against last year's third quarter. Net fee income
was down 11%. The decline in fees was largely due to lower Capital Markets and Advisory levels and Global
Banking and Markets and lower equity market activity in Hong Kong in Wealth and Personal Banking.
[indiscernible] (00:12:32) Global Payments Solutions were up 18% in Commercial Banking and up 8% in Global
Banking and Markets. Other income was up 49%, including another strong FX performance in the quarter.
On the next slide, we've reported a net charge of $1.1 billion or 43% of ECLs in the quarter. This included $600
million of modeled stage 1 and 2 provisions and overlays, $400 million of stage 3 loans and $100 million of write-
offs. There was a $300 million charge in the UK, including $200 million of additional allowances for heightened
economic uncertainty. $400 million also relates to the Mainland China commercial real estate market, around two-
thirds of which are stage 1 and 2 provisions and the remaining third are stage 3. The overall quality of our loan
book remains good. Stage 3 loans as a percentage of total customer loans are stable at 1.8%.
In terms of outlook, we expect an ECL charge of around 30 basis points for this year. And for 2023, we now
expect ECLs to be at the higher end of our 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point planning range, but with a higher
degree of volatility around this guidance, given the uncertain market outlook.
Turning to slide 8, we've had three quarters now of relatively stable costs year-to-date, and we continue to expect
costs to be broadly stable on last year. Within that, third quarter adjusted operating costs were 5% up on the
same period last year, driven by continued investment in technology and timing differences in the variable pay
accrual versus the third quarter of 2021. We made a further $600 million of cost program savings during the third
quarter with costs to achieve spend of around $700 million.
The formal three-year program ends this year. We now expect to spend between $6.5 billion and $7 billion,
slightly lower than our original $7 billion CTA target. But the expected cost savings from the program remain
unchanged at around $5.5 billion by the end of this year, rising to around $6.5 billion of cost savings by the end of
2023. We continue to target around 2% adjusted cost growth for 2023 with an ongoing focus on active cost
management to mitigate inflationary pressures.
Turning to capital on slide 9, our core Tier 1 ratio was 13.4%, down 20 basis points on the second quarter. This
includes the sale of our French retail banking operations, which had an impact of around 30 basis points, and
further negative reserve movements through other comprehensive income due to higher rates.
Reported risk-weighted assets were down $23 billion on the second quarter, principally to FX movements. And
we've now achieved our year-end ambition of at least $120 billion of cumulative RWA saves with modest further
saves still expected in the fourth quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
We expect core Tier 1s to now recover strongly in the fourth quarter, back towards 14%. This reflects a number of
factors, including the formulaic impact of how our dividend is accrued during the year. We accrue at the top end of
our payout range, so have already accrued $0.28 year-to-date, and additional capital management actions we've
been taking to offset the negative OCI movements.
Please remember that this is not guidance of our full-year 2022 dividend intentions. The dividend accrual is purely
a formulaic calculation that will true up at the full year based upon the results and outlook at the time. We continue
to expect to move back to the bottom end of our 14% to 14.5% target core Tier 1 range during the first half of
2023 and to consider buybacks from the second half of 2023 onwards.
So, in summary, these were a good set of results, good earnings diversity across the group, growth in all of our
business lines, and continued strong control on operating costs. Despite a weakening credit outlook, our credit
quality remains strong. For 2023, we're upgrading like-for-like revenue assumptions. We continue to target around
adjusted cost growth of around 2%. And we expect to be at the bottom end of our target core Tier 1 range in the
first half of 2023.
Finally, after another quarter of good progress, we remain confident of delivering our targeted 12-plus percent
return on tangible equity in 2023 and beyond. We expect a 50% dividend payout ratio for both 2023 and 2024,
supplemented by active capital management for surplus capital beyond this.
We've included a slide on Canada in the appendix. So, you can see the shape of the business and the tangible
equity within it. We've also included slides on Mainland China commercial real estate and the Hong Kong loan
book.
With that, Elmer, if we could please open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mr. Omar
Keenan from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Omar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi, everybody. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions and best of luck for the future, Ewen.
Could I please ask a question on capital planning and on the provision scenarios? So, just on capital planning,
could you give an update on where HSBC is on the tactical RWA measures that are meant to get the core Tier 1
ratio up to above 14%? So, it'd just be good to have an idea of that.
And just given the focus on real estate prices in the UK and Hong Kong and Mainland China, would it be possible
to give a sensitivity in terms of RWA migration to lower real estate prices in 2023, for example, what a sort of 10%
to 15% across the board reduction in real estate prices would mean for RWAs?
And my other question on asset quality, could you give a little bit more color on the guidance for full year 2023? I
guess there's a lot of moving parts between stage 3 and moving towards a downside or downside two scenario.
So, when you're thinking about the FY 2023 guidance being at essentially 40 basis points, what sorts of
assumptions are in there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen, do you want to pick up those points directly? And, Omar, thank you for your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Look, on capital planning, I guess, yeah, various parts to that. I mean, firstly, I touched on when I spoke about the
technical nature of how we accrue dividends during the year. So, we've accrued $0.28 so far this year. So, there
will be very limited drag in Q4 from dividend accrual.
Secondly, yeah, we've largely completed the $120 billion program that we committed to. I think there'll be a bit of
a carry through into Q4 of a few billion. And on top of that, going back to Q1, we did implement a series of other
sort of tactical measures to support the core Tier 1 given the movements we were seeing driven by the ACI losses
and the impact that was having on capital.
We're already seeing some of that benefit come through the Q3 results and there'll be incremental benefits in Q4.
But I would say that we – yeah, you should see material improvement in the core Tier 1 ratio in the fourth quarter.
And then, we'll be back at the bottom end of the core Tier 1 range by the middle of next year, which also then
supports the buyback comments for the second half of 2023 because, at that point, with a 12%-plus return on

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
tangible equity and a 50% payout ratio and we've signaled that we expect low-single-digit loan growth next year,
that means the business at that point is very capital accumulative.
On the second question on the real estate crisis, look, I don't have to hand what a 15% impact would be on
ratings migration across the book. But, yeah, perhaps I can get you to follow up with the IR team afterwards.
There is quite a bit of detail in the Pillar 3 documents that I think they can help you sort of sift through to try and
estimate what that impact may be.
And then, on asset quality for 2023, well, look, firstly, I think we do expect, on the China commercial real estate
book, to continue to see some losses coming through that portfolio through 2023. It still feels like we've got some
ways to go before we're going to get to stability and improvement in the China property markets.
For the UK, probably the market with the biggest delta around it for us at the moment is the UK. Yeah, we have
already, in some ways, front-end loaded potential stage 3 losses for 2023 with forward economic guidance
adjustments that we've made during the third quarter. And above and beyond that, look, I think we're just being
reasonably prudent with the guidance at the moment. We didn't say 40 basis points. We said to the higher end of
30 basis points to 40 basis points. I think when we look at consensus, it's sitting at slightly higher than 40 basis
points at the moment, but we're not really trying to change that guidance.
But when you think about the world next year, I think it's also important to recognize that places like Hong Kong
and China are likely to have better economic performances in 2023 than in 2022. So, for us, when you think about
our business mix, we have got a blend of some parts of the world seeing improved economic performance next
year.
I don't know, Noel, if you want to add any other comments on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'd just reiterate the fact that despite the guidance to say at the top end of the 30 basis points, 40 basis points,
we're still committed to the delivering 12%-plus RoTE. So, it's affordable within the RoTE guidance we've given
you. And we are building stage 1 and stage 2 provisions now in anticipation of potential losses turning into stage 3
losses in 2023. So, we've taken a prudent position on balance sheet positioning as well.
Next question, please.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Noble from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG (UK)
Morning. I was wondering if we can just walk through the NII guidance. So, you're saying the $37 billion has gone
down $1.2 billion for FX. My understanding of the trading book funding cost, because that was already within your
previous NII sensitivity, so rates have gone up and I would have assumed that your NII should have gone up by
8


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
more than what you're guiding to. So, the $36 billion looks quite low to me. So, I was wondering if you could walk
us through your thoughts on that one, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Sure. I'll do my best. Look, on the NII guidance and, yeah, there's a sort of – the technical side to the
guidance is on the walk from the second quarter. Yeah, firstly, as you've noted, we've had adverse FX
movements of $1.2 billion. And our planning assumption is that rate moves will increase the cost of funding in the
trading book by at least $1.3 billion. Yeah, the cost of funding will be a drag on net interest income, but we'll have
a dollar-for-dollar improvement in trading income and noninterest income. So, relative to the second quarter, we
think we're guiding like-for-like revenue guidance up by at least $1.5 billion, even though the net interest income
guidance is down by $1 billion.
Look, on the non-technical side, we think our net interest income assumptions at the moment are cautious. Yeah,
I think, increasingly, the interest rate sensitivity tables that we show you are less helpful because they are based
on a 50% deposit beta.
Yeah, given, yeah, the relatively unprecedented speed in rate rises that we've seen relative to recent history, I
think we are being deliberately cautious in key assumptions. We're assuming in that guidance very high deposit
betas, elevated levels of migration out of noninterest-bearing current accounts and contraction of asset margins in
some areas. Yeah, we'll, obviously, see how this plays out in the coming quarters, but I would say, at the moment,
we are trying to be deliberately cautious in that guidance. And I would note that, like-for-like, we have increased
the guidance by around $1.5 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And just for clarity, the cost of funding, the trading book was inherent in the Q2 numbers, but that cost has
increased by $1.3 billion. So, it's an increase on the Q2 and it's an offset between NII and non-NII. So, a lot of the
cost on NII is higher by $1.3 billion, the benefit reemerges in the non-NII, that $1.3 billion reemerges.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. And the other thing is just also to note, which was in my comments, but if people missed it, was that FX
impact will also have a corresponding impact on operating expenses. The 2021 costs were $32 billion. That
translates to $30 billion on average FX rate year-to-date and $29 billion if we were to use September averages.
So, I do think where consensus is sitting at the moment looks too high relative to those numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG (UK)
Thank you. Just to follow up on the NII bit, so the trading book funding costs go up, but you've effectively
assumed that the banking book doesn't benefit at all from incremental rate rises that you've assumed in Q4. Is
that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Implicitly, in those assumptions, I think that's broadly correct, but, as I say, I think within our planning
assumptions at the moment, yeah, very cautious assumptions across deposit betas, deposit migration and asset

margins. And I think, again, that answer is more nuanced if you go to the individual legal entity level. I think
probably in Hong Kong, we are getting towards peak NIM during the fourth quarter, I think. In some of the other
markets, I still think there's further expansion of NIM.

Hi, Joe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Thank you for taking my questions. Ewen, you cited a weakening credit outlook. Could you just discuss for us –
help us dimension a little bit a couple of things in terms of – for instance, how a strengthening dollar plays on
credit cost in your Asia footprint?
And then, relatedly, if I look at the Hong Kong interbank liquidity is down to about HKD 100 billion and the HKMA
has been active in defending the peg. It's not a zero chance that the peg could break. And I guess what would be
the consequences for the bank in that event particularly from a credit standpoint? If you could help us think
through those two dimensions, that would be helpful. Many thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think let me take the second question first, if I can, and then, Ewen, you take the first. We do not believe there is
any risk to the peg at all. We believe the peg, the HKMA have sufficient capabilities to defend the peg and that's
not a scenario that we envisage.

On the first part of the question, Joe, that – yeah, we don't think there's – when we look across the portfolio in
Asia, there's any meaningful impact from stronger US dollar apart from potentially in smaller markets, for
example, in Sri Lanka, but I mean that's not all dollar-related. But at a sort of big macro level, we don't think the
strength in dollar has a material impact on us as we look out on credit quality across the region.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. And good luck, Ewen, with your future career. Just a couple of
questions for me. The first one was just back on impairments. I'm sure it's pretty my understanding, but when you
look at the $300 million CRE overlay and the $200 million UK overlay, if I look at your overall coverage ratio on
your loans to customers, it's pretty much flat at 1.1%, which is about the same as 2Q and FY 2021. And I would
have expected that to go up if a lot of the provisions you're taking are just reserves rather than treating underlying
delinquency. So, why hasn't that coverage ratio stepped up? Are there other moving parts, obviously the write-offs
and underlying delinquencies? That would be my first question.
And my second question, just following on from an earlier question, when you talk about your greater than 14%
guidance on CET1 from first half 2023, have you factored in potential risk migration from higher loan losses falling
CRE within that or if we saw increased migration, would that be a risk to that greater than 14% CET1 guidance
from one half 2023? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On the second question, yeah, we've clearly factored in, yeah, a view on what the economic outlook is and what
the impact on ratings migration would be as a result of that. And you can see what our assumptions are on the
macro outlook from our IFRS 9 scenarios. So, yeah, clearly, within that, in some markets, there is an element of
ratings migration that we've built into our RWA forecast and capital forecast.
On your question on impairments, I mean, I guess it's hard to answer the question on a macro level. On the
commercial real estate portfolio in China, we have definitely increased the level of overall provisioning against that
portfolio.
Yeah. And then on the UK, again, I'm sort of struggling to get my head around the sort of takeoff of the provisions
we had at the beginning of the year because of COVID and the putting back on provisions that we're now putting
back on, I think net-net, we put more on in the UK than we took off at the start of the year. But, look, I'll get the IR
team to follow up with you on the specifics, but I think on the two portfolios that we're sort of most focused on at
the moment, provisioning levels are higher than where they were at the beginning of the year.

Hi. Morning, Ewen, all the best to your future career. And I have two questions. The first one is just to follow up on
that revenue and cost guidance and making sure I heard it correctly. So, assuming constant currency revenue is
$1.5 billion higher and, I guess, cost guidance hasn't really moved, 2% inflation, does that imply, on a pre-
provision basis, you're guiding for $1.5 billion higher of PPOP? So, that is the first one.
And then, second question is around the exit of Canada business. Compared to many other markets that HSBC is
exiting, Canada is actually quite a profitable market with mid-teens ROE. So, just want to understand what is the
rationale for that exit. And as strategically as you look at the footprint of HSBC, are there any further markets that
you are reviewing at the moment? Thank you.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, thanks, you've got our guidance exactly spot on, i.e. on a constant currency basis, revenue is up
$1.5 billion, no change in the cost guidance. So, on a pre-provision level, there should be a $1.5 billion increase.
And if you think about the guidance that we've given today on ECLs, that even after ECLs, there still should be a
net improvement on our guidance on a pre-tax basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. And on Canada, let me explain some of the rationale as to why we're considering alternative options
on Canada. Firstly, you're absolutely correct. The business has performed well and is performing well with a
return on capital above our cost of capital and a very strong recovery post COVID. The team had done an
extremely good job.
Rationale for considering alternative options are as follows. First, our market share in Canada is around about
3%.
And second, it's largely a domestic business. The international connectivity between our Canadian business,
particularly in wholesale banking and supply chain finance is less internationally connected than many other
markets that we operate in.
And then, thirdly, we've had strong interest in our business from the point of view of other banks looking to buy it.
We clearly have to consider, on behalf of all shareholders, is the value that they would attribute to that business
significantly greater than the value of holding our profit stream within HSBC? And we're testing that at this point in
time by looking at the strategic options. Our assessment is there is a reasonable probability that the value will be
significantly accretive. And, therefore, it's right that we consider that option.
Strategically, as I said, our market share is in the 2% category and the international connectivity of that business
is relatively low. So, that's why we've given serious thought to an alternative strategy for Canada. But I
reemphasize the management team in Canada have done an excellent job.
Then, you asked me the question on, do I consider that same evaluation for other markets? And clearly, we
always look as a management team on the performance of our businesses, the value in our hands relative to the
value in others and also the strategic importance. So, we do, do that, but at the moment, we're only looking at
commencing a process on Canada.
And I can probably anticipate your second question, so let me deal with that now on Mexico. And if I do the same
analysis on Mexico, I start with a market share analysis where depending on the product line or customer
segment, we have somewhere between a 7% and 10% market share of the business in Mexico, so a much
stronger market share position.
We have strong growth being achieved in our Mexican business at the moment with significant upside potential.
And I think that's particularly true as we believe that as an international bank in Mexico relative to other
competitors, our position as an international bank is being enhanced.
Thirdly, we believe that the supply chain interconnectivity between Mexico, the rest of the world and the US will
actually increase in volume of business and business opportunity because it is an important manufacturing base
13


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
into the US. And that's at the core of what we do. And we have a very strong market share position in retail
banking in Mexico with strong interconnectivity between retail and corporate banking in Mexico as a result of the
payroll services. And we also believe that we've got the strong shareholder value accretion potential by holding
our business in Mexico.
So, we're not going through a similar process on Mexico. We think we have good opportunities to continue to
grow that business. It's starting from a stronger position and it's not my intention to sell Mexico. So, hopefully, that
was a reasonably comprehensive answer. As and when we make a final decision on Canada, we will update you
on the outcome of that process. Thank you.

Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Hi there. Could I just ask on the cost target for next year, please, the 2% in 2023? Because, I think, everyone
appreciates it's a pretty tough target given the inflationary environment. Ewen, I think you've said in your chat at
the start that it's going to need active cost savings to deliver. And, now, you pointed out, Ewen, it was fairly key in
terms of the cost transformation and installing disciplined cost management. So, I guess my question is now that
the CFO is leaving, is there a risk that hitting the target may become more dependent on paring back investment
rather than finding additional cost savings? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I can respond to that very categorically. There will be no easing at all in our cost discipline. I'm absolutely
committed to that cost target. Ewen has done a tremendous job on driving cost discipline into the bank, but I
share that agenda and I'm committed to that agenda.
As we've said in the past, we've got a headline target of 2%, around 2%. We know that that's challenging in a high
inflation environment. But we also know we've got cost savings coming through next year from the transformation
14


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
program we've already embarked upon. And that's the equivalent of 3%. It's about $1 billion of flow-through
savings.
We also know we're identifying additional cost-savings opportunities through further simplification, further
digitization and further organizational change and that can add to that 5% underlying capacity to pay. So, I'm not
going to pretend in a high inflation environment the 2% is easy, but I'm also going to be – remain absolutely
committed to delivering that.
I thank Ewen for all of the great work he has done on instilling those disciplines in the bank, but I will make sure
those disciplines remain and are committed for the future. So, there's no weakening in that target.

Manus Costello Q

Good morning, guys. I actually just had a couple. Just to triple clarify on the cost target for next year, the base of
which the 0% to 2% growth comes from is the $29 billion FX adjusted, not the $30 billion that you have as a year-
to-date FX average rate. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. The only caution I would put around that, Manus, is that exchange rate is bouncing around. So, that was
true at the end of September. Whether it remains true by the end of the year, we'll see.

But it's on an FX-adjusted basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
But the thesis is correct. We're not trying to play games with FX and setting that target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah. No, it wasn't entirely clear from the release this morning, given the way you've given the $30 billion number,
that the $29 million is the current starting point.
My second question is actually about the commercial real estate outlook in China. When I look at your
disclosures, you're taking much higher impairment on your Hong Kong booked exposures, in your Mainland
booked exposures. And are the additional $400 million of impairment you've taken this quarter, mostly related to
Hong Kong booked? And why is Hong Kong so much worse? Is there a risk that, that Hong Kong book could
really accelerate away from you? You've taken about 8% or 9% so far of the bookers' impairment. Could that be
materially higher if there's some kind of structural problem with your lending agreements in Hong Kong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, yeah, well, it's booked in Hong Kong. It's the offshore component of the China commercial real estate
portfolio, Manus. So, yeah, we've got just under $20 billion of exposure, just over $7 billion of that is onshore and
just over $12 billion of it is offshore. The offshore book is definitely weaker than the onshore book.
Yeah, so I would say – if you look at the substandard, we've provided disclosure on substandard and impaired,
yeah, which is about 35% from memory at midyear on the offshore book and about 3% on the onshore book. So,
you can see, in that, very, very different asset quality considerations.
Yeah, a lot of the policy support that's going through in China is definitely providing a lot of support for the
onshore portfolio, providing a lot of liquidity support for the onshore portfolio. And in some cases, it's a question of
whether that liquidity for regulatory reasons can be used to support the offshore book. So, yeah, we do expect
there to be further provisioning against the offshore book. But, yeah, to keep that in context, $12 billion is on a $1
trillion loan portfolio. So, it's just over 1% of total exposure we have as a bank.
But, Noel, I don't know if you've got other comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think it's a fair assessment. The offshore book has a different risk profile to the onshore. But our clients and our
onshore portfolio is a relatively high-quality tier 1, tier 2 city-orientated book. But what we've got to work out is how
16


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
the policy measures benefit not just the onshore business, but the offshore and that's still an evolving picture. And
therefore, we've got to keep that under close review.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Should we consider the offshore book at this point to be essentially unsecured if they're not able to get access to
any of the liquidity measures and the questions over collateral? Is it effectively an unsecured book that you've got
offshore on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Relative to the onshore book, it is less secure than the onshore book. So, that is a fair assessment. But is it fair to
say that the onshore policy measures will not benefit the offshore book? No, that's not a fair statement. I think we
have to see, on a client-by-client basis, how much of the onshore liquidity support can then support that
company's ability to service the offshore book. So, I wouldn't have a complete separation between on and
offshore. It will be client by client dependent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Manus, I wouldn't describe it as unsecured. Yeah, the onshore book is typically secured against specific
properties. The offshore book has less specific security, but there is security underpinning that portfolio. But, it's
not secured and it's definitely not unsecured. It sits somewhere between those two.

Good morning. Hey, Ewen. Let me echo, first of all, earlier comments and thank you, Ewen, for the good
collaboration over the years and all your patience with our questions. If I could just have two, one on pass-
throughs and one on asset quality, I was just wondering in terms of pass-throughs, earlier comments were on
pass-throughs being more benign compared to assumptions you have made earlier in the year. I was just
17


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
wondering have you seen any meaningful signs of attrition in your core markets, Hong Kong and UK ring-fenced
bank, in terms of other accounts or current accounts into higher-yielding accounts, is it something which has
started to trend higher and could imply higher pass-throughs going forward?
And secondly, on asset quality, I was just wondering, what are the main ramifications you think higher mortgage
rates in the UK will have? I think, most recently, mortgage rates headline have increased to a level of around 6%.
And I was just wondering from your UK business perspective, what are the main implications of mortgage rates at
such a level? Thank you.

Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Noel, do you want me to go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Yeah. Please. Please, Ewen, go on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, on the pass-through levels, Martin, they have been, I guess, below expectations so far, but I think
they have been rising. And as I said in our guidance, we've made some reasonably conservative assumptions
and cautious assumptions on where deposit betas go to from here. But implied in that comment is materially
higher than 50% to what we've seen to-date. And again, hence, why the caution on using net – interest rate
sensitivity tables at this point because they're based on a 50% deposit beta which I think are becoming
increasingly less relevant as we get to higher rates.
We haven't seen any material attrition. Where we are seeing is migration out of noninterest-bearing current
accounts and savings accounts and, yeah, we're starting to see that trend now in Hong Kong pick up a bit given
where rates are. But again, just as a reminder, typically, if you looked in previous cycles, our extent of deposit
migration out of noninterest-bearing current accounts has been well below sector averages in Hong Kong.
On asset quality, again, the book in the UK is typically a mix of two-year and five-year fixed. So, yeah, the impact
of that for those higher rates will take time to roll through the book. They are typically stressed when we put them
on to rates of up to 7%. So, yeah, and if you – you can look at our IFRS 9 modeling, yeah, and look at the
downside one and two scenarios, if you want to look at the potential sensitivity we have to higher provisioning
levels, if you want to take some more adverse scenarios on the outlook for the UK. But we think, as we sit today,
yeah, we're not complacent about it, but we think, for most of our customers, those higher rates are affordable
given on the stress analysis we put on when those loans were put on.

Hey, Raul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you so much for taking my questions and my best wishes to Ewen as well.
Noel, if I can start with a follow-up on your commentary around Canada and Mexico. I'm just trying to understand
your reaction function to any incoming capital proceeds that you might generate from an M&A. How would you
think about capital deployment if you were to reach a position in excess? Would you consider further acquisitions,
I think that's one of the comments you've made publicly, or should we expect that the majority of capital that is
generated from these disposals should be returned to shareholders?
And the reason I ask for this is, I think, historically, HSBC has linked various share buybacks to specific disposals.
And so, I was just wondering whether you might be willing to link any subsequent disposal-generated capital
proceeds to a direct share buyback.
And I guess the second question I have is remaining on wealth management. I was just wondering, obviously,
we've been expecting a recovery in Wealth in Asia for a while and things are, obviously, still challenging on the
ground. I was wondering if you could update us in terms of your thoughts around how much – how the business is
positioned going forward and whether or not you see any structural challenges arising from recent developments
in terms of Wealth growth. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Thanks, Raul. Let me deal with Canada item first. Look, it's still very early in the process on Canada.
So, I don't want to be too definitive on use of proceeds. But clearly, there would be an expectation, an element of
– a significant element of the proceeds. There is – I don't want to hang on to excess capital. So, as we get back
into our target range of 14% to 14.5%, which we're going to do without the benefit of Canada and then if we were
to load a Canada disposal in on top of that, you would clearly have excess capital sitting at the group.
Now, it would be reasonable to assume that we may retain some of that capital to fund future growth, that would
emerge in 2024 and beyond. But a good proportion of that capital would be available for distribution. I don't want
to give too much guidance on that at this stage. Let us get through the process on Canada. But I have no
intention to hang on to excess capital over and above our target range unless we see good opportunities for
profitable growth. So, I think it would be a reasonable expectation to expect some distribution of that capital back
to shareholders in some form.
On wealth management, I think on Asia, we're seeing the Hong Kong market reopening. Activity levels
domestically are increasing. We're seeing the Hong Kong market reopen internationally. So, I think the prospects
are far better for 2023 than there have been throughout 2022. So, I would expect activity levels to increase.
But what you'll also hopefully see is a more stabilization in the equity markets. So, the investment environment
has not been very supportive, particularly in Asia, even though at the same time as the activity levels have been
suppressed. I think if we start to see a stabilization of the market, there'd be an increased appetite to use
alternative investment products.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
And what I referenced in my opening comments is we're building the platform for future earnings growth from
Wealth by continuing to accumulate net new assets. And as we talked about in the last 12 months, we've
accumulated $91 billion of net new assets. That $91 billion, given the suppressed market situation and investment
appetite at the moment, is not yet producing good earnings, but it will do in the future. That is a platform for future
Wealth earnings that we're continuing to accumulate.
And I liken it to what we did in the deposit book. We still accumulated deposits from good operating accounts,
particularly in wholesale banking and retail banking, noninterest-bearing operating accounts, and we did that
during the times when they weren't earning a revenue stream. And now we're getting the benefit of that, and that's
exactly what we're now doing on Wealth. We're continuing to expand customer acquisition, asset acquisition, in
order to build a platform for future Wealth revenue growth.

Hi. Morning, Aman.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
...and look forward to hearing what you do next. Can I just squeeze in two questions, please? Sorry to come back
to net interest income, but the guide for next year, I am really struggling to make sense of. I do appreciate there's
a greater than symbol that's sitting in front of that guidance, but if I was just to mechanically take your $32 billion
guide this year, the Q4 exit NIM run rate or NII run rate annualizes at around $36 billion for next year. So, I mean
you're basically assuming absolutely no incremental rate benefit in your [indiscernible] (01:00:16). The
assumptions that must sit behind that must be extremely conservative. I appreciate you're talking about betas
above 50%. Please can you help us just understand a bit more exactly if there's something we're missing and the
extent to which those numbers are conservative?
And then, secondly, I wondered actually if you had an update for us on the impact of IFRS 17 on your P&L. I'm
mindful that we're some kind of two months away actually from the implementation of it. You've given us some
guidance before. Could you help us understand the kind of the impact on NII fees and costs? The reason I'm
20


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
asking is because your fee income performance, your noninterest income performance in Q3 is actually quite
robust. If I add back in the $600 million as mark-to-market negative that you had, you're actually annualizing at
quite a healthy clip. I need to understand how much I should be taking off that for IFRS 17 to work out if
consensus next year is in the right place. Anything you can help us with there would be really appreciated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Yes. Well, I'd just start – to start with IFRS 17, look, I appreciate that we're sort of in an awkward phase at
the moment with some of you modeling IFRS 17 numbers in terms of your forecast and some of you still on IFRS
4. And, yeah, we're not able to – and we're giving our guidance at the moment based on IFRS 4 rather than IFRS
17.
So, look, I think we are going to be in that sort of unsatisfactory position for a few quarters as we work to give you
a sort of IFRS 17 adjusted view of the world in the coming quarters. But just to repeat, what we said a couple of
quarters ago, we expect reported earnings to be down by around two-thirds. I think as part of that, you need to
adjust out the impact of MCU. And we expect TNAV to be down around $3 billion and that the net impact on
RoTE as a result of that to be relatively de minimis. So, I think, yeah, the latest internal numbers we're looking at
is around 10 basis points of impact on 2023 RoTE, but those numbers are still sort of being worked on.
So, look, I appreciate it's an unsatisfactory position for all of you. We are working as hard as we can to get to a
position where we can provide you clarity or better clarity and when we can, we'll update the market.
Just on the comments on, yeah, the maths of 4 times $9 billion to get to $36 billion, I think you do need to add the
$1.3 billion on top of that for the switch into trading income. That is an uplift in the guidance that we're giving and
an addition to that annualized rate of $36 billion. So, I think we would say $37.3 billion plays $36 billion in your
maths. And then, I sort of revert back to the conservatism or caution on other assumptions we're making.
Look – and the reason for that is just we genuinely think we are facing a relatively unprecedented period given the
sharpness of rate rises that we've seen. And we are generally trying to be cautious on giving you guidance over
the next couple of quarters, but if we find going into Q4 that our assumptions can be upgraded. I'm sure Georges
and Noel will be talking to you about that at full year results.

I mean, joking aside, if you think about the trends in noninterest income this year, I mean I think you do need to
add back about $1 billion like-for-like on insurance MCU. Yeah, I think some of the other line items when you go
through it, some have clearly benefited this year. Some have significantly underperformed when you go through
the Global Banking and Markets P&L, there's a lot of pluses and minuses in performance this year. I think we've
talked about Wealth and the depressed conditions for Wealth this year. But even just on a pure technical basis, I
think you need to add $1 billion back for the insurance MCU.

Yeah. And I think if you look at the underlying fee growth or the non-NII, we've seen very strong global markets
performance in the volatile markets. We've seen suppressed event-based fees because of the low activity in M&A
and capital markets. We can each have a view as to whether some of that event activity will come back next year,
but there's a probability that there's an element of that going to be coming back next year.
And you're going to have a continuation of good fee growth on GLCM or Global Payments Solutions in both CMB
and GB&M. I don't see that trend declining. I see that trend continuing of good fee generation there. And as I said
earlier, my expectation is there'll be an opportunity for some growth in our fees around wealth management as
both activities and markets start to pick up and investment starts to flow back into alternative asset passes. But it's
unpredictable at this stage. We'll have to see how next year goes, but I think there are some elements of our fee
performance that are going to be enduring.

With that, if I can just share some closing remarks, I'd appreciate it. Firstly, thank you very much for joining the
call today and your questions. To close, just a few summary comments. We had another good quarter with
underlying growth in all businesses, positive impact of rate rises and continued tight cost control. We remain on
track to hit all of our financial targets, including a RoTE of at least 12% from 2023 onwards. I want to reassure
