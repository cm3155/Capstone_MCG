Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to the Columbia Banking System's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.
I would like to introduce Jackie Bohlen, Investor Relations Director, to begin the conference call. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen
Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results.
The earnings release and corresponding presentation are available on our website at
columbiabankingsystem.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to
risks and uncertainties and are intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. For
a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to the disclosures
contained within our SEC filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures, and I encourage you to
review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided in our earnings materials.
I will now hand the call over to Columbia's President and CEO, Clint Stein.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Jacque. Good afternoon, everyone. We made considerable progress over the past three months on
the initiatives we discussed in April. We enacted changes to the way we evaluate and approve deposit pricing,
which resulted in increased stabilization in the cost of customer deposits. We also achieved more expense
reductions during the quarter than what we anticipated and communicated to you in April.
When we spoke last quarter, I outlined the realization of $43 million in annualized net cost reductions from the
operational effectiveness work that began during the first quarter. This work is the result of identifying
opportunities for improvement, after observing a year of the combined company's operations. These opportunities
resulted in a lower head count, given the elimination of redundant and overlapping positions and have simplified
our organizational structure. But our opportunities are not limited to just expense cuts. They include revenue
generating franchise reinvestment. And a cost conscious culture enables us to make reinvestments to support our
long-term growth and profitability outlook. Annualized expense reductions year-to-date from our operational
effectiveness work equate to $64 million on a net basis and $76 million on a gross basis. We have roughly $6
million of remaining annualized expense reductions slated to be enacted in the third quarter, which will get us to
our initiative goal of $70 million in net savings and $82 million on a gross basis. These savings are in addition to
the $143 million net and $188 million gross savings related to last year's merger. We have achieved $264 million
in annualized savings over the past 18 months, with $45 million already reinvested into the future growth of our
company.
We have $12 million of the $76 million of cost savings achieved in the first half of 2024 earmarked for franchise
reinvestment that will occur over the next 18 months or so. We didn't execute on near-term expense initiatives at
the detriment of the future growth and competitiveness of our company. At the end of the third quarter, our gross

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
expense reductions will be $270 million merger to date with the previously mentioned $57 million either already
reinvested or allocated for reinvestment, resulting in net reductions of $213 million or 58% above our original
commitment of $135 million at the announcement of the merger. These steps were not taken with the survivor's
mindset. We executed this initiative and will continuously evaluate our expense base so we can thrive well into
the future while delivering on our promise of being a high performer.
Our head count reductions were wrapped up during the second quarter. The remaining $6 million of planned
expense savings will come from other operational sources during the third quarter. The savings I outlined are as
of quarter end. They are not fully reflected in the second quarter's normalized operating run rate of roughly $270
million, which does not include the previously mentioned expected reinvestments in the coming quarters. While
we have made substantial progress towards the annualized fourth quarter expense run rate we outlined in our
March update, we are not adjusting that guide given these planned reinvestments. As we wind down the work to
right size our expense base, our ability to invest in our people, our franchise and our suite of products and
services remains fully intact. We believe these revenue-generating investments, along with the lower expense
base will continue to drive additional long-term shareholder value.
The heavy lifting is behind us and we are very optimistic for the future. The franchise we set out to create with the
merger in 2021 is here. We are running it and we are making it resilient to any operating environment. Our early
success on near-term initiatives has not diminished our laser focus on regaining Columbia's placement as a top
quartile bank as we drive toward long-term, consistent, repeatable performance.
I will now turn the call over to Ron.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
All right. Thank you, Clint. We reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.57 and operating EPS of $0.67. And our
operating return on average tangible equity was 17% while the operating PPNR was $219 million. Please refer to
the non-GAAP reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to
our calculation of operating metrics.
On the balance sheet, we have limited growth and reduced interest-bearing cash levels to target approximately
$1.5 billion. Within deposits, we have more of a traditional seasonal decline in non-interest bearing demand,
related to taxes and corporate distributions. Our net interest margin increased to 3.56% in Q2, though it was
3.52% for the month of June. Both were within our estimated range of 3.45% to 3.60%. Asset repricing more than
offset a 6 basis point increase in interest-bearing liability costs. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.97%
for the quarter and 3% for the month of June. The quarter also benefited from higher prepayment speeds, which
resulted in higher discount accretion for the securities portfolio.
Looking forward, we expect purchase accounting income to align more closely to the first quarter's level than the
second quarter's level as detailed towards the end of the earnings release. Our projected interest rate sensitivity
under both ramp and shock scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position and we expect our rates down
deposit betas to approximate those experienced on the way up. Our provision for credit loss was $32 million for
the quarter. The portion related to our leasing portfolio declined 18% this quarter to $17 million.
Our overall allowance for credit losses remains robust, closing the quarter at 1.16% of total loans or 1.35% when
including the remaining credit discount. Total GAAP expense for the quarter was $279 million, while operating
expense was $262.5 million, both down from the first quarter, reflecting the efficiency initiative Clint discussed
earlier.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
And as discussed last quarter, we've included the $12 million restructuring charge this quarter in non-operating
expense. Included in operating expense was a $7.7 million one-off nonrecurring credit. Absent this, I peg our
normalized level of operating expense at $270.2 million in Q2, down 5% from the normalized level of $286 million
in the first quarter. We continue to expect our Q4 operating expense run rate to be in the annualized range of
$965 million to $985 million, excluding CDI amortization. After adjustments, our normalized Q2 run rate was at the
lower end of that range.
As Clint noted, we expect franchise reinvestment to drive the run rate higher, partially offset by additional cost
savings related to near-term initiatives. I'll close with commentary about our regulatory capital position. Our risk-
based capital ratio's increased as expected in Q2. We expect to build capital above our long-term targets, which
will provide for enhanced future flexibility.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron. The stable performance of our loan portfolio underscores the robustness of our through-the-
cycle underwriting process and the caliber of our borrowers and sponsors, even as we continue the transition to a
more typical credit environment after a prolonged period of exceptional quality. This quarter we saw 31 to 89 day
delinquencies, improved 22% to $86 million, with the rise in 90-plus day delinquencies, primarily resulting from the
expiration of COVID-related designations within the residential mortgage portfolio. Non-accrual loans decreased
approximately $6 million, mainly due to reduced balances in the FinPac portfolio. These overall classified loans
remain stable.
Our proactive and detailed monitoring of the portfolio complemented by targeted reviews of specific asset
categories like multifamily and office properties, has revealed no systemic issues across various industries,
sectors or geographic regions. Notably, there were effectively zero delinquencies in our entire non-owner
occupied and multifamily portfolios at the end of the quarter, and delinquencies within office properties specifically
were remarkably low at roughly 40 basis points of the total office portfolio, with no charge-offs in either category.
Overall, net charge-offs for the company stood at an annualized rate of 32 basis points for the quarter, of which
the bank contributed 6 basis points and FinPac 26 basis points. We remain very satisfied with the quality and
directionality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio, which is highlighted in greater detail in our investor
presentation.
I will now turn the call over to Tory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank.
Targeted actions taken during the first quarter resulted in tighter control and a renewed discipline around deposit
pricing. Changes enacted directly contributed to the stability in our interest-bearing core deposit rates in the latter
part of the first quarter and through the second quarter as our teams continued to lead with service, not price in
their customer interactions. Our branches recently wrapped up a three-month small business campaign in late
April, which generated nearly 6,000 accounts and $345 million in new deposits to the bank. Importantly, 27% of

those balances were non-interest bearing, and these accounts have collectively increased by roughly $20 million
since the campaign ended in April. A new campaign was launched in June with over $110 million in new money
coming to the bank through mid-July. As with the spring campaign, the summer campaign includes bundled
solutions for customers without promotional pricing or special products. The new accounts enhance the
granularity of our already diversified deposit base and provide numerous opportunities to deepen relationships
over time as businesses grow and we fulfill their needs with additional products and services.
Our cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 9 basis points during the second quarter to 2.97%, compared
to a 34-basis-point increase during the first quarter, highlighting a significantly slower pace of increase following
our actions. Our cost of total deposits was 2.01%. And if we isolate our customer balances, 36% of which are
non-interest bearing, our total cost of customer deposits was 1.56% in the second quarter.
Our focus on relationship banking continues to benefit our performance in this higher rate environment. While
recent pricing trends and our successful deposit campaign results are encouraging, the second quarter was also
impacted by anticipated declines in noninterest-bearing deposit balances due to seasonal pressures that include
customer tax payments. Noninterest bearing balances were down 2% on both in an end of period and average
basis in the second quarter. While pricing pressures have moderated compared to 2023, as the Fed funds rate
has remained constant for the past year, persistent inflation continues to draw down customers' account
balances. That said, our teams are focused on generating new business to offset this headwind, as evidenced by
our ongoing campaigns and our proactive activity by our bankers. Their success will be key to containing our
deposit cost regardless of whether we see any rate cuts from the Fed this year.
Turning to the loan portfolio. Relationship driven growth remains our primary focus. Loan balances increased 2%
on an annualized basis in the second quarter after adjusting for a $95 million in targeted loan sales. Commercial
lines of credit and construction draws activity drove the quarter's expansion. While our loan pipeline remained
steady, our core fee income pipelines continued to expand. We are seeing growth across categories including
treasury management, commercial card, merchant services and international banking, to name a few. The
contribution of these line items to core fee income was up 7% on the quarter and 14% from a year ago. We are
also seeing tremendous traction with our Umpqua Smart Leads. Umpqua Smart Leads use predictive analytics to
help our teams capture additional business with our existing customer base through needs based solutions. Our
close rate was up 22% between the first and second quarters.
While incremental growth in a single product takes time to drive notable bottom line performance, we are
encouraged by the favorable trends in our collective products and services. Our bankers remain focused on the
activities that drive balance growth in customer deposits, core fee income and relationship based loans.
I'll now turn the call back over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Tory.
We remain committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive long-term shareholder value. In line with
our expectations, our capital position continues to build as our ratios expand. At a total risk-based capital ratio of
12.1%, the parent company is above our long-term target of 12%. The bank, however, remains modestly below at
roughly 11.7%. Our TCE ratio was 6.8% at quarter end, up from 6.6% at March 31, despite some modest adverse
impacts from AOCI. We continue to target a ratio closer to 8% before considering meaningful options for
deploying excess capital. The second quarter demonstrates our ability to organically generate capital well above

what is required to support prudent growth and our regular dividend, providing us longer term flexibility for
additional returns to shareholders.
This concludes our prepared comments. Chris, Tory, Ron, Frank and I are happy to take your questions now.
Lisa, please open the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital
Markets. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. It looks like a good quarter. Ron, maybe start with you. Can you maybe help us think through the margin
outlook a bit more? I see the 3.52% margin you flagged in June. I hear you on a little less accretion, but you
probably have a rebound in noninterest-bearing. So help us think through a good starting point or some of the
puts and takes that you see on the margin outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Good question. And actually, really no change from the last quarter. It's really going to depend on deposit
flows. Do we see that seasonal strength in noninterest-bearing in Q3? We will be in the upper end of that range, if
not, we'll be in the middle or on the lower end. But I do want to flag the discount accretion was a bit higher in Q2. I
don't expect that to recur unless you saw a meaningful rally in the bond markets. So probably somewhere in the
middle of the range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just to confirm, you guys would welcome a couple of cuts. It looks that
way in your documents, in your comments, but you'd welcome a couple of cuts in terms of the margin outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, it'd be beneficial, obviously, net interest income, we are liability sensitive in our position in the balance
sheet that way over the last year, so. But, we're positioned for when and if it ever comes.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, good. And then Clint or Tory, obviously some decent success on the deposit initiatives.
Can you talk about what's really worked well and what you're seeing in terms of overall deposit cost pressures?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure, Jon. This is Tory. I would say – I think there's a couple things that work really well and we mentioned in the
call and I think Chris maybe want to – can add in on this. I think our small business group within retail, the branch
system, just an outstanding job just being – kind of having energy deployed outbound. And I think the entire
company is doing that. I mean, it's been a year-and-a-half, as we kind of work through all the process, product
knowledge, infrastructure within the company and just a ton of energy that's being deployed outbound. And they
had some great results in – without pricing – without any special pricing or any other gimmicks, it's really getting
out and hitting the street and kind of presenting the value of Umpqua Bank and what we can do for small
businesses and what we can do for commercial customers to just bring their relationships over. So, added a ton
of accounts and a lot of balances.
On the pricing front, I think this has been very constant since we employed some restrictive pricing pressure on
our bankers within – in the footprint. We've seen rates continue to kind of track down a little bit, 5, 10, 25 basis
points as we've had conversations with customers one by one by one. And I think the cost has been – I think
we've done really nice job kind of keeping the lid on costs. And I don't think there's at this point any additional
outside pressure from many institutions that would bring that back up.
So, Chris, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Tory. Hey, Jon, it's Chris. I think that what Tory saying there lean into there is our ton of
conversations that are going on every single day with our customers about what they're using the money for, how
long they're looking for, what the current rate environment is, what the competitive environment is. And I think part
of the competitive environment is definitely calm down, which makes those conversations a little bit easier. It's not
as a frantic and it's a lot of hard work by our bankers that are out there each and every day doing that. And
working with customers about directionally where we go if we get a cut, our customers I think will be ready
because our bankers have been having conversations with them and we'll see if that happens. So, yeah.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I guess on deposit cost for my first question, it looks like you lowered deposit rates in some of your consumer
categories in early July. I guess can you speak to kind of retention as you've been doing there and plans to do
more or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Matt, Chris. Thanks for the question. We really lowered throughout the last few months. July was one piece
of it, but really started back in the late February [indiscernible] (00:21:54) timeframe. Retention has been
extremely good. When you look at – I'll point to the promotion [indiscernible] (00:22:03) campaign that Tory
mentioned. And all of those balances, new accounts that came in, they're actually growing and without extra
pricing. And then on the CD portion and things of that nature, we're still maintaining, retaining 80%, 85% of those
balances. And so, yeah, we're following that extremely closely – and commercial is experiencing the same thing.
And again, we still have flexibility to make exceptions and do things that make sense, but it's really – it's really
working on that, that piece of it. We'll continue to look for opportunities in the competitive market of where our
posted rates are and we'll continue to work the exceptions down as we can. And then of course, pay attention to
where our forward CD pricing is.
Tory, I don't know if you want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. I think well said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then on your brokered CDs and borrowings, they were both relatively flat in the quarter. Could you just
speak to whether or not those might start coming down and kind of just trying to get a sense for the pace and
magnitude in the overall kind of earning asset level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Matt, this is Ron. Good question. You look back at the last couple of quarters, we've taken down the level of
interest-bearing cash at the Fed, now in this – right around the $1.5 billion. And that's really been the collapse as
to what we do with the wholesale funds based on other loan and deposit flows. So if we see net seasonal growth
in deposits second half of the year over and above loans and you'll see those wholesale balances drop. But the
offsets are always going to be targeting right around $1.5 billion on interest-bearing cash at the Fed. And of those

wholesale funds, be a brokered deposits or the home loan bank advances, they're structured anywhere from 2 to
call it 9, 10 months out. So we've got plenty of opportunity to drop it over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then maybe one for Frank on charge-offs. I didn't see FinPac isolated. I know you gave the bank
charge-offs of 6 basis points, but – and I haven't done the math to back into FinPac. But can you just speak to
what the – how the FinPac net charge-offs trended in 2Q. And I think there's an expectation for more relief in the
second half, but just want to double check there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, FinPac came in at about 26% of the total charge-offs and they're right on track to our expectations. We're
definitely seeing improvement through all of the delinquency balance. Notably, 31 to 180 day delinquencies are
down over 12% from last quarter. Non-accrual balances as a percent of the portfolio are down about 23%. And
those turn into future charge-offs. And so, throughout the rest of the year, I think we're going to see more
significant improvement than we've seen over the course of the last two quarters. So things are progressing as
planned.

Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I'll start and then I'm sure that Chris and Tory might want to add in and clean up the mess I leave on the
table here with it. But, in my prepared comments I talked about the reinvestment that's already occurred and
we've spoken over the last couple of years about where we've expanded into new geographies that – we tracked
that and we didn't – that's what's coming off that original $188 million that, that we talked about a year ago to get
to that net number of the [ph] $143 million (00:26:51).
So we still have some things. We opened our first branch in the Phoenix metro area last month. We have the
second one opening in Scottsdale, here in a couple of weeks. And we have some other locations where we're
putting in – so we can have full service banking capabilities within those new geographies. And Tory was
reviewing the new markets activity from a commercial perspective with me yesterday. And it's pretty impressive
what the teams have accomplished in all of those markets. And so, our commitment to them is that if they perform
and produce that we will continue to invest in helping them grow those markets.
And so that's – that's what some of that looks like. It's – the other thing is, is we continue to attract really, really
good talent from other organizations and so we're seeing opportunities to fill in, in certain geographies and
strengthen the team. We've got some technology platforms that are in flight, that are pretty exciting for our teams.
I'm not going to mention on the call because I don't want to give our playbook away to any of our competitors that
might listen in. So, it's people, it's facilities, it's technology. It's all the things that we think will help us grow
revenue over the long haul.
Tory, Chris, anything?

Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Right. I think it's well said. I mean, we – I think, Clint, really what he – one thing he mentioned, I think we're really
proud of is we had four new commercial offices that we partnered with retail banking. We've got branches that are
in flight and there in some great markets for us [indiscernible] (00:28:43) team in the Bay Area and Napa Valley,
and Arizona, Colorado and Utah and all are well ahead of budget and substantially in the black, profitable and
really great to see, so it's – it really gives us a ton of confidence that we can continue to hire and attract really
talented folks and put them in market and give them the tools to be successful. We've got some product and
some technology that, as you mentioned, I think it's just going to continue to advance the company and our ability
to serve our customers. And I think we're all really excited about certainly the future of this organization.

grow. We're not just looking to grow in retail and commercial, it'll be across wealth, it will be mortgage offerings.
It's going to be full service like we do in our other markets. It'll just look more branch light than it would look in,
say, Washington and Oregon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. You guys – you also saw the book of transactional resi mortgages in the quarter. Are there any other
transactional books that you may be interested in selling to maybe help optimize the balance sheet further just as
the secondary markets pretty open right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The short answer is yes. And, we've spoken about that. We've talked about it, I think, during some of the
conversations that we had in the first quarter about optimizing the balance sheet and where there's some
transactional real estate portfolios. We need the market – we need rates to come down to certain levels before we
could execute on that. In the meantime, we're trying to convert them from transactional into full relationships. And
to the extent there's any success with that, then we would just lower the amount that we expect. But offhand, in
terms of anything immediate, I don't really see that there's anything. We've kind of cleaned up a lot of that stuff
over the past year, shortly after the merger last year, last June, July, I think it was – what, Ron – a little over $0.5
billion of transactional loans we sold out of the [ph] market of Columbia (00:31:18) portfolio. And then just as
opportunities present itself with some of these resi portfolios, we've taken those down as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just thinking about the loan growth side, obviously this quarter is – some declines in non-
owner occupied CRE, growth in construction. You've made a bunch of new hires like you talked about where –
we're investing in that side of the business. I'm curious how do you think about the loan pipeline? What's the pulse
of your markets? How's demand looking? And where are you seeing growth opportunities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
This is Tory. There's a lot of pieces in there. I'll start with this. The pipeline is very consistent to what it was last
quarter. And I think if you can recall, last quarter I talked a little bit about it – Q1 pipeline at the end was pretty
consistent with Q4 except in terms of total dollars, just that there was a shift, there was a reduction in the CRE
pipeline and a – likewise – like amount increase in the C&I pipeline and that has held steady. So we continue to
see a slight decrease in the CRE pipeline and kind of a matching number dollar amount increase in C&I.
So, feel good about this continued progress of focused on the C&I side and C&I front. But demand is relatively
benign. There's just not a ton of demand for lending opportunities anywhere. There's some pockets of real
optimism. We recently did a survey with commercial customers throughout the West and kind of very significant
contrast between middle market customers and their optimism versus small business or smaller commercial
customers. So, there's some opportunity in the middle market side, but then less on the lower-middle market and
small business in terms of loan demand.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Geographically, the West is still strong. I mean, companies are performing well. They're still just kind of electing to
use cash for some investment needs rather than borrow money. I mean I feel good about it. Teams are deployed.
We're really focused on full relationship banking. If we're going to make loans to people, we want their deposits
and we want the opportunity to provide services to create fee income for the bank. So, I feel good. I really feel
we're probably a low-single digit loan growth number through the balance of the year. But I think we're poised to –
when the opportunity exists for us in terms of more demand, we'll be ready to go and get out there, make sure
that we're providing great service for our customers and bring in new names to the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. Within C&I, are you seeing a more opportunity with deepening relationships at existing customers
or are these new relationships that you're bringing to the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I would say both. There's a major emphasis on expanding relationships that we already have. So new products,
new services, a lot of fee income business. I talked about the fee income pipeline. I mean, if I look at treasury
management, commercial card, merchant services, international banking, I mean, those four solutions right there
are big for us. We're seeing a lot of activity. We've had a lot of growth in that part of the fee income pipeline and in
just production itself. So, feel really good there.
New names are a tougher road. But we've had some really good success in some of our de novo markets, but
we're also having success everywhere and the whole idea here is that we're going to focus on our customers, we
are going to serve them really well, provide products and services for the needs that they have. And then there's
an outbound effort to make sure we can bring in new names to the company.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, in regards to credit quality and your targeted reviews, could you just elaborate further on amount of the loan
portfolio that you reviewed? I know you mentioned zero delinquencies, but any other surprises, any other
takeaways, that would be great to hear.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, no, no surprises, Brandon. I mean I think everything is – is – is moving how we kind of expected, the higher
rate environment, the high duration for longer. You see the impact and some of the smaller customers
[indiscernible] (00:36:32) delinquencies are ticking up and our SBA loan portfolio continues to experience higher
delinquencies and higher, higher charge-offs than we typically would see within the portfolio. But most of those
carry some sort of a government guarantee that, so that's – that's a – that's a form of mitigant for us. But the
biggest kind of success that – that I – that I would point to at least for me is – is just our commercial real estate
portfolio was just and just performing absolutely fantastic. The – the teams are – are laser focused I would say
first on – on portfolio management and staying ahead of – of any potential repricing and maturities. And second is
– is kind of going out there and looking for additional business. And so – and so as we see these repricing
opportunities on the horizon, they are already identified. They are not surprised by them. If it looks tight we are the
first ones out talking to them and we address it ahead of time, as opposed to being proactive. We are proactive as
opposed to being reactive. Excuse me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And in the reviews, did you include any re-appraisals or updated LTVs or is it mainly just kind of looking at
what it was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We – we – yeah, we – we would not reappraise unless there is a – an event – an event of maturity or – or a – a
downgrade into more of a classification type status. But what we do do is – is we look at current rent rolls and we
kind of extrapolate from that a form of evaluation. And we update the value internally if you will for that evaluation.
So, so we feel – we feel good about the position of the portfolio and the numbers that we throw out there in the
investor presentation. They are – they are as current as we can make them and as accurate as we can make
them based upon the information that we have. We have seen some – seen some decreases obviously in value,
but we have always employed a leverage averse kind of posture to underwriting. And so – so we – we feel really
good about the portfolio and the loan to values in the event that we have to restructure some of these things as
we move forward, which we don't see presently so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Very, very helpful. And lastly for me, just on fee income, particularly core fee income, there was some –
some good strength there. Could you just speak to the momentum in those line items and kind of what's your
outlook over the back half of the year and beyond?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Sure. Hey, Brandon. This is Tory. So, that – those four big categories that I talk about, Treasury Management,
Commercial Card, Merchant Services and International Banking. Collectively, they are about – they are up about
7% quarter-over-quarter. And then year-over-year they are up about 14%. The two biggest movers are in terms of
percentage of Commercial Card and International Banking. And I would categorize it this way that the fee income
pipeline continues to grow every single day. I think I mentioned Umpqua Smart Leads, this ability to kind of look at
predictive analytics and help our bankers see a product or service that can provide a solution for a customer and
gives them kind of a warm lead. We have had a lot of success in leveraging that and going out to our customer
base and kind of walking them through, what certain products and services will do to support their business and to
help them become more efficient, more cost effective in the pipeline. It's – it's – it's very well received by the
bankers and even – it's even better than that. It's really well received by the customer base. And they see it as a
real positive and a real, very helpful for them. So, it's pretty easy sale and so I am seeing a lot of -- a lot of growth
there. Pipeline is strong, very optimistic about that. I mean there is no reason why this can't just continue on with
these kind of growth numbers because the activity just keeps picking up and eventually just kind of it hits to the
bottom line and it's just reoccurring every single day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Brandon, this is Chris. I will add from the kind of the other side of the business that we talked about the – the
campaign in the – in the spring, we are seeing increased in merchant referrals that are now starting to book. And
so Merchant Card revenues are up and that's a real positive sign. And then the other one would be it's in our
wealth management division. Our trust company is doing extremely well. We built a lot of connections with our –
the new bankers and others in there and we are getting a lot more referrals internally into that space. So, it's good
quality growth there. Assets under management are up considerably this year from new business being driven in.
And then in our wealth advisor group, we talked in the – back in the fourth quarter that we pivoted our platform
over to Raymond James and that transition went through into the second quarter. It's now officially I would declare
it behind us and those groups are now starting to see the – what we had – we planned for was with a platform that
had better technology and an end user experience. We expected to see revenue increasing in that space and
that's exactly what we are starting to see and would expect that to continue throughout this year.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Hey, maybe just – could you go back to the – the growth in residential non-performers. I think you referenced that
coming off of COVID protections. What – is that just loans that were delinquent that are now switching to non-
performing? Is that require a provision associated with that or is that separate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jared, this is Frank. Yes, that's exactly what they were – they were – there were loans that – that – that
started to struggle sometime during COVID. And we – we employed modifications, deferrals to them. Our
accounting group subsequently removed the flag for those – for those loans. And – and that's what you see in the
90-plus category today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And Jared, this is Ron. No meaningful provision on that. A good chunk of that also is government guaranteed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then looking at mortgage banking, any sort of update on – on what you expect for that going –
going forward? I guess maybe second quarter you got a little benefit seasonally, but how you are seeing the
outlook there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jared, this is Chris. I think it's really settled into a really nice spot since the transition of it, it's very
consistent month in, month out. We are seeing most of the volume obviously is being driven by purchases at
around 69% to 70%. There is still refi activity in there that comes in around 15%, 16% each and every month. And
– and there is a little bit of construction lines to perm that make up the remainder of it. Most of it is we had
discussed about the strategy and where we are going is more of a bank and mortgage company within the bank.
Actually, we are a [indiscernible] (00:45:07) of the bank is the mortgage company, 80% of the production is
saleable product with the remaining part going into the portfolio. So, yeah, no, it's settled down. I think the teams
have done a really nice job. We are seeing good internal referral activities. I couldn't be happier with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then just finally for me, the $7.7 million incentive comp reversal that you referenced, I guess what were
the – what were the triggers that – that caused that to be reversed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, it's – it's part of – it's part of the analysis that we did in terms of – of overall, as part of the expense initiative
and looking at some of our – our compensation programs and being able to correlate those to driving shareholder
value versus utilizing those as part of reinvesting and growing revenue streams in the future. So, so we had – we
had an accrual out there when we terminated or altered the programs, then we just didn't – didn't have a need for
the accrual. So, we had to reverse it.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. So, should we – should we think that a core run rate on salaries and benefits this quarter would be closer to
that [ph] 150 to 153 level (00:46:34)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jared, this is Ron. With that $7.7 million maybe correct. But more importantly [ph] $217.2 million (00:46:42)
would be a normalized level expense for Q2, excluding that because that won't be recurring.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thanks. Good afternoon. Wanted to talk about another question on the mortgage side. I thought at one point
there was an effort to maybe look at minimizing the volatility within that line item in the fee income side. And I
can't remember if that was a legacy Umpqua thing or maybe shrinking the MSR portfolio. Is there any thought or
effort to minimize that ahead or was that something that was in the past? Sorry, that's...

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Hey, Jeff. This is Ron. Good question. And yeah, very much that was Umpqua historically and we have reduced
volatility within mortgage-related fair value changes. For example, prior to – prior to the run up in rates, we didn't
have a hedge on the MSR. All right. So, we benefited from that on the way up and we now got a hedge on the
MSR. So, that will help protect no matter which way rates go in the future on that front. So, all of the nice words
are just reducing – reducing volatility in many ways. In many cases it's fair value volatility, just given which way
rates move. No plans at this point to significantly reduce the level of MSR, I think you are going to see a pretty
steady state and again we have got that hedge for any potential future rates down environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, just – just to add to that, I mean I think beyond just volatility in the mortgage area, really any – any part of
our operation, that's – that's – that's volatile. I mean seasonality is one thing. Business cycles are another thing.
But if it's truly just something that's volatile and creates noise, we are going to take a hard look at those things and
– and anything that – that has a negative implication on our ability to just be consistent quarter-after-quarter is
going to get, get a lot of scrutiny.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got you. Thanks. And Clint, you kind of teased this a little bit, taking a look at some of your newer production in
the Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City. Is there – have you guys put a dollar figure to that in terms of like year-to-
date production that comes from – I just – I have a vague idea of – of what those newer locations you have talked
about reaching breakeven, but wanted to get a sense for what is the loan production out of – out of those relative
to the total company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean they – they have done a tremendous job and I would say if they are listening to the call they will be
disappointed if I don't – if I don't clarify that. They are – they are beyond breakeven if possible.

And I don't know that we have disclosed anywhere in terms of specific for by – by geography. We – that's a
slippery slope because then we – we start thinking about all the other elements of our footprint. But so I don't – I

No, I would – no I would just – I would just say that other than just balances it's with a few people. So, the
expense base is pretty low, but they are very, very talented, hard working folks. And they – they have been able
to bring new names into the company. They have got a lot – they have got strong noninterest-bearing and
interest-bearing deposits. They have got good strong almost solely C&I loan balances and really good fee
income. So, they are kind of carrying the flag of the bank in a great way on relationship banking in all of those new

markets. And starting from basically scratch and very, very proud of the efforts that they have put in and the
success that they have had. And it's meaningful numbers, I mean relative to the rest of the company it's a smaller
number, but it's a meaningful number. And to build the ability and to be able to go in and start from a dead stop
and have success so quickly and to be profitable so quickly is – is a great thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got you. Lastly, Clint, and I imagine if you – if you look at open bank M&A, if that's even an option, but you are –
might be prioritize, team lift outs or anything from a – from an acquisition standpoint, is that anything you are
looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Our – our top priority is in my prepared remarks I said the company that we set out to create when we
announced the merger in 2021 we are running it today. So, our top priority is, is to get the most out of this
company and hopefully these last two quarters and the efforts that you have seen with the execution of – of the
expense initiative, the momentum that Chris and Tory have talked about on the business side, that we are starting
to prove that out. So, I think we still have some work to do. But, we live it every day. So, we know that – the
strength of this company and the quality of the people that we have that are out there every day taking care of our
customers. So, that's – that's our top priority. I – I mentioned earlier that we are still attracting talent. And whether
it's a team without – Tory mentioned the [indiscernible] (00:53:11) team that is one of the new groups that we
started in the past nine months or so. If you think about that we probably interviewed 50-plus people or looked at
50-plus people from that organization and took about 9. It was so – so just because somebody is out there,
doesn't mean that they are going to meet – meet our criteria, how they go to market, how they drive value. But we
do – we are always looking at any opportunity that's there. I would say the lowest priority right now would be open
bank M&A. Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen with the election and that process. And we are just now
getting the scar tissue healed up from – from the hell that we were put through in 2022, 2023. So, never say
never. But I just – I don't think now is the time for that. We have got other priorities that are more pressing and I
think will drive – drive more shareholder value over the long run.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Ron, just a quick one on the fourth quarter expense range, the annualized $965 million to
$985 million, balancing what you did this quarter in the investments, is there any reason for us as analyst to lean
on either side of the midpoint?

Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think at this point looking into Q4 midpoint probably makes more sense.
