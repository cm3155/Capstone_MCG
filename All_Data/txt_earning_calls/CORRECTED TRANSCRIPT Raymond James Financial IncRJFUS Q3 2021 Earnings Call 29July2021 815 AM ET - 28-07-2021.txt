Q3 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent forms 10-Q which are
available on our Investor Relations website. During today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial
measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thank you, Kristie. I'm actually joining you today from Chicago where we've had a number of
day meetings with some of our top independent advisors. So, it's great to see both their success during the
pandemic and their excitement as we move forward. It's kind of hard to believe now, it's been over 16 months into
the pandemic and we're just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with the distribution of vaccines. And
now the spread of Delta variant reminds us that we could be dealing with this one way or another for quite some
time.
Fortunately, our economy has really proven to be resilient and creative, quickly adapting to these changes, which
has facilitated the recovery of our economy, the stock market over the past year. Similarly, our advisors and
associates have been just simply amazing. I'm really proud of what they've been able to do, enabling Raymond
James to achieve these record results for the nine months of fiscal 2021.
So, why don't we move on to slide 3 with our quarterly results. The fiscal third quarter was another strong quarter
with several, I guess, many records. The firm reported record net revenue of $2.7 billion (sic) $2.47 billion (01:30),
net income of $307 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.18. Excluding the losses on extinguishment of
debt of $98 million and $7 million of acquisition-related expenses, adjusted quarterly net income was $386 million
and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.74, both records.
The increase in quarterly net revenue was largely driven by record asset management and related administrative
fees and record investment banking revenues during the quarter. Adjusted net income growth was due to the
aforementioned higher net revenues, along with the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared to a
provision for credit losses a year ago. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 15.9% and the adjusted
return on tangible common equity was 22.2%, really an impressive result especially in this near-zero rate
environment and given our strong capital position.
Move to slide 4 and we'll see that the quarter ended with a record total client assets under administration of $1.17
trillion, which were up 33% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets
in fee-based accounts of $617 billion, a 9% sequential improvement, which will benefit the fourth quarter, and
record financial assets under management of $191 billion.
We ended the quarter with record 8,413 financial advisors, and that's net increases of 258 over the prior year
period and 86 over the preceding quarter. Advisor recruiting has been robust even in this very competitive market.
Over the prior four quarters, financial advisors with approximately $325 million of trailing 12 production and nearly
$53 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically.
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of
nearly $69 billion over the four quarters ending in June 30, 2021, representing more than 8.5% of domestic PCG

assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. And this trend has accelerated
throughout the 12-month period with the past two quarters reaching an annualized rate over 9%.
So far, this fiscal year is shaping up to be very strong in terms of advisor retention as well as attracting new
advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. In fact, we're on track for a
record year of advisor recruiting in fiscal 2021. We remain focused, though, on providing a superior platform to
support advisors and their clients and also helping advisors grow their practice and it's resonating well in the
market. Advisors are attracted to our leading technology solutions as well as our advisor and client-centric
cultures.
Let's move on to slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.7 billion and pre-
tax income of $195 million and a 11.5% pre-tax margin, reflecting significant operating leverage over the past
year. Quarterly net revenues grew 3% over the preceding quarter, predominantly driven by higher asset
management and related administrative fees, reflecting higher assets and fee-based accounts, which will also
provide a tailwind for the fourth quarter.
The Capital Markets segments generated quarterly net revenues of $446 million and pre-tax income of $115
million, driven by record investment banking revenues and a continued very solid fixed income brokerage revenue
performance. This strong result reflects the significant investments we've made to strengthen our platform over
the last 10 years.
And we are continuing to make investments, including the recently completed acquisition of the consumer-
focused M&A advisory firm Financo and the announcement of the acquisition of Cebile, a leading private funds
placement agent and secondary market to private equities. We are excited to welcome Sunaina and her team to
the Raymond James family when we close the deal, currently expected to be in the fiscal fourth quarter.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $225 million and record pre-tax income of
$105 million. These results were primarily due to the growth of financial assets under management driven by
equity market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by
the modest quarterly net outflows for Carillon Towers Associates (sic) [Carillon Tower Advisers] (06:50) following
a solid quarter of net inflows in the fiscal second quarter.
Turning to the bank, record net loans of $23.9 billion grew 13% over the prior year and 4% sequentially. This
growth was primarily driven by the strong growth of the securities-based loans to PCG clients of more than 50%
and 14%, respectively. This is a loan category we continue to see good opportunities for growth and attractive
risk-adjusted returns.
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $169 million and pre-tax income of $104 million.
Quarterly net revenues declined 5% compared to a year ago quarter primarily due to the impact of lower short-
term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenue grew 6%, as higher asset balances offset the modest
compression in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter.
Pre-tax income growth year-over-year was primarily due to the loan loss reserve release in the quarter compared
to a provision for credit losses a year ago period. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, as
Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 6, we generated record net revenues of $7.07 billion during the
first nine months of fiscal 2021, up 20% over the same period a year ago. And despite the losses on

extinguishment of the debt this quarter, we still generated record net earnings per diluted share of $6.92 for the
first nine months of 2021.
Adjusted net income was $1.06 billion, up 73% from the net income in fiscal 2020. And given all the unique
circumstances, I think it's also worth comparing our results so far in fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2019, a very strong year
for Raymond James. When comparing the first nine months of fiscal 2021 to the first nine months of fiscal 2019,
net revenues have grown 24%, net income has grown 27%, and adjusted net income has grown 35%. Truly
spectacular results, particularly given the zero interest rate environment this fiscal year.
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on slide 7, the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset
Management segments all generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first nine months
of the fiscal year. Again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I wanted to highlight a separate announcement we made this morning. We
announced our firm's intention to make an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of UK-based
Charles Stanley Group at a price of £5.15 per share or approximately £279 million, the US equivalent of
approximately $387 million.
Charles Stanley is a firm we've admired for a long time and has a tremendous reputation, a 200-year heritage and
a talented pool of wealth managers and professionals. The two firms share a common, and increasingly rare,
client-centric approach where the primary client relationship is held by the individual wealth managers.
Raymond James' subsidiary in the UK, RJIS, has operated in the UK for over 20 years under strong leadership
and has experienced exceptional growth. This combination with Charles Stanley would provide the opportunity for
further accelerated growth in the UK, the second largest English-speaking wealth management market. Charles
Stanley has nearly 200 wealth managers and £27.1 billion in client assets, bringing our total UK assets to over
£40 billion.
Additionally, Charles Stanley multiple affiliation options would give Raymond James the ability to offer affiliation
choices consistent with our models in Canada and the US, and greatly accelerate the growth of the RJIS newly-
launched employee affiliation model, while building on its market leading independent contracting and investment
management services businesses.
As I mentioned, the announcement today is our intention to make this offer. We expect the offer to be made in
approximately a month. Regulations issued by the UK Takeover Panel limit what we can further say at this point,
but we'll provide updates as more information is made available.
Now, for a more detailed review of our third quarter results, I'm going to turn it over to Paul. Paul?

Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 9. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion grew
35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially commensurate
with the sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter. Private Client Group assets in fee-
based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth
quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $552 million grew 14% over the prior year, but declined 7% from the records
set in the preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the
records set in the preceding quarter. Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis, but
down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes as well as a large placement fee in the preceding quarter.
Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to
higher average mutual fund balances.
Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million grew 99% year-over-year and 14%
sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting results. Our investment
banking pipelines remain strong. So, we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average
of the quarterly revenues generated over the first three quarters of the fiscal year. That would have been about
$260 million on average. But, of course, this line item is inherently difficult to predict. Other revenues of $55
million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter,
of which approximately $10 million were attributable to noncontrolling interest which are reflected in the other
expenses.
Moving to slide 10, clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat
compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to
experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the
client cash is being held in the Client Interest Program at the broker-dealer. Over time, that cash could be
redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher
spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis, as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. The combined
net interest income and [ph] BDP's (15:02) from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the
preceding quarter, as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset
balances in Raymond James Bank. However, it's still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the
second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite
near-zero short-term interest rates.
In the lower left portion of the slide, we show net interest margin or NIM for both RJ Bank and the firm overall. We
continue to expect the bank's NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or two. The
average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter.
We believe this average yield will remain around this level for the rest of the fiscal year, but there will likely be
downward pressure in this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year, if banks demand for
deposits don't improve from current levels.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 12, first our largest expense, compensation. The compensation ratio
decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2%, largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment,
which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gains which do
not have direct compensation associated with them.
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined manage of expenses, we remain confident we can maintain the
compensation ratio lower than 70% in this near-zero short-term interest rate environment and as I've said over the
past few quarters, we could outperform that just as we did in the fiscal third quarter with Capital Markets revenues
at or near these levels. Non-compensation expenses of $425 million increased 18% compared to last year's third
quarter and 53% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
related expenses, the noncontrolling interest of $10 million and other expenses related to our private equity
valuation gains, and higher business development expenses.
As we discussed last quarter, we successfully executed a debt offering in the fiscal third quarter to take
advantage of the low rate environment and significantly extend the maturities of our existing balances. We raised
$750 million of 30-year senior notes at 3.75% and utilized the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our
next two senior notes that were maturing in 2024 and 2026, effectively resulting in the same amount of senior
notes outstanding. This resulted in $98 million in losses associated with the early extinguishment of those notes,
but in doing so locked in very low rates for 30 years, while significantly extending the duration and stability of our
funding profile.
Overall, our results show we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses, while still investing in
growth across all of our businesses and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients. Excluding the
debt extinguishment expense, we do expect non-compensation expense to continue picking up over the next few
quarters, as hopefully travel, recognition trips and conferences continue to resume and we continue to increase
our investments in technology and high quality service levels for our growing business. We would eventually
expect loan loss provisions associated with net loan growth as well.
Slide 13 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 15.6% in fiscal third
quarter of 2021 and adjusted pre-tax margin was 19.8%, which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss
reserve release, and still relatively subdued business development expenses. At our Analyst and Investor Day in
June, we outlined a pre-tax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near-zero interest rate environment. But as we
experienced during the first nine months of the fiscal year, there's meaningful upside to our margins, when Capital
Markets results are strong and improving macroeconomic trends lead to releases of our allowances for credit
losses.
On slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $57.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase,
reflecting solid growth of securities-based loans at Raymond James Bank. Liquidity and capital levels are very
strong with cash at the parent of approximately $1.56 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.5% and a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of 12.6%. We have substantial amount of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic. The third quarter
effective tax rate of 20.3% benefited from non-taxable gains in the corporate life insurance portfolio. We would
expect that tax rate to be around 21% in the fiscal fourth quarter, assuming a flat equity market.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In the third quarter, we
repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million. As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share
repurchase authorization. But as Paul Reilly will discuss, our priority continues to be deploying capital to grow our
businesses.
Lastly, on slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan
portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Non-performing assets remained low at just 12
basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially. The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million
reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings, on average, within the corporate
loan portfolio.
Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a
percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% at the quarter-end. For the corporate portfolio, these
allowances are higher at around 2.4%. We believe we're adequately reserved, but that could change if economic
conditions deteriorate.

Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. So, overall, I'm very pleased with our strong results for this quarter which topped many records
and did so in spite of the persistent challenges of the global health pandemic and near-zero short-term rates. As
for the outlook, we remain well positioned entering the fourth fiscal quarter with records of many of our key
business metrics, strong pipelines for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking. In the Private Client
Group, results will benefit by starting the fourth quarter with a 9% increase of assets and fee-based accounts.
With the strong recruiting pipeline, we're on track for a record fiscal year of recruiting as prospective advisors
across all of the affiliation options have continued to be attracted to our platform, including the leading technology
solution, our advisor and client-centric culture. These recruiting results are primarily strong given the very
competitive market for experienced advisors.
In Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains strong and we expect solid fixed income
brokerage results, driven by demand from depository client segment. However, keep in mind, there is still an
economic uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic that could impact these results. In the Asset Management
segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results to be positively impacted by higher financial assets
under management.
Active asset managers continue to face structural headwinds. However, we are pleased to see positive net flows
on a fiscal year-to-date basis for Carillon Tower Associates (sic) [Carillon Tower Advisers] (23:30). We hope that
the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of our high quality asset active
managers. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow, as we have ample funding and capital to grow
the balance sheet. We'll continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and
mortgages. And we'll continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed
securities portfolio.
As we look further ahead, we remain focused on the long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our recent
Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across all of our core
businesses, continue to expand our investments in technology, and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.
Today's announcement of our firm's intention to make an offer for Charles Stanley Group demonstrates our focus
on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe this acquisition stays true
to our longstanding criteria for acquisitions of first being a good cultural fit, a good strategic fit and makes financial
sense for shareholders, and something we can integrate.
I also want to, once again, take a moment to thank our advisors and associates. They've been amazing at being
able to provide excellent service to their clients through these difficult times. I'm very proud to be a part of this
special Raymond James family. Thank you all for attending.
With that, operator, Tommy, I'm going to turn it over to you for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll get with our first question on the line from Manan
Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please go right ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you can dig in a little bit into the Charles Stanley Group acquisition. Can you
just talk us through maybe the rationale for the acquisition, why expand in the UK versus the US, and maybe what
the synergies are with your current business there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Again, there's not a lot we can say right now except the strategic rationale is that we believe we can grow in all of
our markets and we certainly have the capital to grow in the US, Canada and the UK and believe in all three of
those private wealth markets. We've been in the UK market at Raymond James, RJIS for 20 years and we've had
very good growth but we are, I'd say, undersized and our employee channel is really nascent. Charles Stanley
brings first a culture identical to us. It's stewarded by the Howard family for generations. And I think the fourth
generations in the business has the very same value of client-centric, advisor-centric culture and has multi-
channels.
So, the combination gets us at £40 billion and really gives us the [ph] mask (27:07) to utilize a lot of the things
they've done well and to continue to grow that business and really give us the base to make a difference. So, it's
not saying we're not choosing it over the US, Canada or the UK, we believe in all three of those markets. And
when we find these rare opportunities to acquire a 200-year-old firm that has a great brand and name and
matches our culture, we're going to act. So, we believe very strongly and I think it will really help our business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And anything – I know you can't say that much given the regulations, but anything you can say on the
financial details, revenues, pre-tax margin, maybe how much capital you are utilizing from the acquisition. I can
sort of see from their disclosure that it's about $240 million or so in revenues and a 10% profit margin. But I'm also
assuming that there's synergies and additional investments that you are thinking about. So, is there any more
color you can give on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would just say that not a lot, I mean you can see the public information on their current revenues and base
and we do plan to invest in the technology of that business. And we think combined, we'll be able to be at a much
better place to do that and they've got a very good back office and strong technology. But outside of the details,
we really can't get into any more details right now. But we will make them available as soon as we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And anything on the capital that you're utilizing for the acquisition?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would tell you in our regulatory filing, we basically said that we have sufficient cash on hand to fund the
acquisition. The regulatory filing also discusses a loan note offering that would be possible. That's fairly common
in the UK. As discussed in the filing, it has a nominal interest rate of about 10 basis points which can change over
time with short-term rates. But, obviously, with the overall cash – or overall consideration of less than $400
million, we have $1.6 billion almost of cash at the parent company as we discussed earlier on in the call. We have
a $1 billion target. So, we have sufficient cash at the parent company to fund the acquisition without kind of any
capital actions beyond that.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from the line of Bill Katz with
Citigroup. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So, I guess maybe start with, Paul, as you think about –
maybe both you guys – just in terms of getting to that Tier 1 leverage ratio, how does this acquisition sort of fit in
against that? And maybe stepping away from that, as you sort of commented on the primary focus area is growth,
should we assume that the bank growth will be the primary driver to driving down that Tier 1 leverage ratio over
time? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you're going to see it in all sorts of ways that you saw the announcement today. We are looking at other
opportunities to expand the business. And again, we can never predict these. So, many of these, we've known
people for years before they're interested in selling. So, our strategic M&A has really sharpened and our
opportunity is to really sharpen, I don't know if deals will happen again, but if we can find opportunities that
expand our business, we've said that's our priority.
We also plan to grow the bank to the extent we can within that and we've used share repurchases when we can't.
So, I think we're still going to focus on opportunities to grow our business, which includes strategic M&A and also
continue to grow the bank and the level of the bank growth than our aggressiveness probably depends first on
economic opportunities, but also how much capital we're able to deploy through other opportunities. So, we'll
balance that out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up question, I was wondering if you could unpack, Paul, your
comments on the NIM about sort of maybe a little bit under the 1.90% over next couple of quarters and maybe on
the sweep side, where you sort of called out sort of second half of next year. Can you maybe ring-fence like what
might be expiring or coming up for contract renewal as we sort of think about the timing next year? Thank you.

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Bill. We're kind of just essentially reaffirming our guidance on the NIM at right around 1.9% that we
provided last quarter. So, over the next quarter or two, obviously depends somewhat on asset mix and the growth
of the agency MBS portfolio which we've essentially decelerated over the last quarter, just given where rates are.
We would expect to come in right around that 1.9%, give or take, a couple basis points over the next quarter or
two.
As far as the yield on the BDP balances with third-party banks, a significant portion of our deposits mature
contractually over the next, I would say, 6 to 12 months. Right now, the sort of market rate for new deposits if you
can even get capacity as much lower than the 30 basis points or to 29 basis points that we're currently earning on
average.
But remember, if the yield on those deposits aren't attractive with those third-party banks, we have the capital
flexibility, going back to Paul's comments earlier, to bring those cash balances on the balance sheet and invest in
other assets. So, I don't think it's as easy as a formula of just assuming that those balances reset at a lower yield
off balance sheet because depending on what [ph] we can or an (33:32) off balance sheet, it may be more
compelling to bring it on balance sheet and invest in other assets at the bank securities and/or loans.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, good morning. So, I had a follow-up to Bill's earlier question. You cited the continued pressure on the bank
NIM consistent with the trend we've seen in recent quarters, just given a very strong loan growth particularly in the
SBL channel and already low securities yields, I was hoping, Paul, that you could unpack what's the primary
driver of the NIM compression from here. And relating to the third-party sweeps, what's the breakeven level or
spread where you might look to sweep third-party cash more aggressively to the bank as you face that re-pricing
or that pricing headwind in the back half of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would tell you, Steve, that the primary driver of the NIM compression because most of the short-term rates
are reflected in sort of the yields of the various asset categories. Most of our asset categories are floating in
nature. So, they reflect the kind of rate environment that we're in. So, most of the NIM dynamic going forward is
really going to be driven by asset mix. So, for example, this quarter we grew securities-based loans on a net basis
$700 million, which was truly fantastic growth, 14% sequentially, over 50% year-over-year and those are fully
secured with marketable securities and help strengthen the relationships between advisors and their clients in the
Private Client Group. So, we love that asset.

But that yield is 2.2%, on average, in the quarter whereas the corporate loans are in the 2.5% to 2.6% and they
have been growing. We can resume growth there, but not to the same extent as SBL. So, just by the change in
mix to sort of the lower risk categories like securities-based loans, that's going to put downward pressure on your
NIM, all else being equal.
As far as the breakeven analysis, I wish it was that simple. There's a lot of variables that go into that to bring it on
balance sheet, obviously uses capital. And then you have to essentially take either duration and/or credit risk to
earn a higher yield. And that higher yield changes week to week depending on the latest Fed announcement. So,
one thing is certain, if we don't have the capacity off balance sheet or the capacity is at very low rates, then the
bringing it on balance sheet certainly looks more attractive on a relative basis and that's something that we have
the capital and the appetite to do, if necessary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. Okay. And then for my follow-up, Paul, just on some of the non-comp commentary that you provided,
you noted that non-comp expenses should grow as T&E picks up, ultimately a good problem to have. If I look at
the non-comps this quarter and I back out the noncontrolling interest piece, the reserve release, the clean number
is about $330 million, it's slightly above that $1.3 billion annualized run rate you had spoken to in the past. Just
given some of the drivers of non-comp growth you cited, how should we be thinking about the pace of growth
from here? And maybe what – can you give us an updated run rate or jumping-off point as we think about the
non-comp trajectory for the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Steve, unfortunately, still a lot of uncertainty there, business development being one prime example of that.
I would say the $1.3 billion jumping-off rate, I want to say that our quarterly revenues at that time were
somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. I don't remember exactly when that was. But we're at $2.5 billion
now.
So, just the business is a lot bigger now and there's a lot of expenses directly associated with the size of our
business, whether it be sub-advisory fees that support the Asset Management business, whether it be FDIC
insurance expense which supports the bank, branches, branch expense as we continue to recruit more advisors.
We've done a couple acquisitions. We just announced another one. So, a lot has changed since we provided that
$1.3 billion metric which begs the question when are we going to provide more new guidance and a new
threshold.
And I would say we want to do that as soon as there's more clarity kind of on the go-forward path, particularly for
things like business development expense. In fiscal 2019, before the pandemic, that was running at around $200
million for the year, $50 million a quarter. So, even this quarter's number of $31 million is well below that as an
example. And then loan loss provisions as well, obviously, that is something that's going to be volatile until there's
more kind of economic certainty or clarity going forward. So, as soon as there is more certainty around what these
expenses will look like, we will certainly be transparent as we always are and try to provide you better guidance.

Steven Chubak Q

obviously, the 9% that you cited is just a very impressive statistic. It looks like both you and your peers are

running well above long-term averages. I was hoping if you could just speak to the sustainability of the organic
growth as well as what you're seeing across all the different affiliation options.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, part of that depends, the market's been robust and people have been growing and client engagements have
been really good. So, that can all change with a downturn where clients get fearful and assets often don't grow the
same in those environments. But if you look at any outlook we see in the short to midterm, it all looks still very,
very positive.
Again, as I said, I'm here at a meeting with our advisors and they're all very positive experiencing our top
advisors, not just record growth in their businesses. But I can tell you by the questions over two days and
watching what they're doing with their practices, they have no thoughts of slowing down either. So, again, short to
midterm, I think it's sustainable. The recruiting has been good across all the options, which is ironic too
sometimes.
We got slowed down a little bit a few quarters ago when the private client – when their employee channel, the
offices were closed and we were adjusting, but that's really taken off. And it's going to hit a record probably. It's on
a pace to hit a record this year even after that very slow start. So, we're seeing it all across the affiliation options.
The pipeline is very strong. And so, I'd say for the short to midterm, it looks very, very good. Longer term, it
depends on the economic viability, the numbers for the economy growth were good this quarter and, in fact,
continues and people stay positive. I think it can continue for a while.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Perhaps just kind of just stepping back a little bit as it relates
to the acquisition. Could you give us a little bit more sense as to your ex US kind of, I suppose, M&A strategy and
where you think maybe some of the markets that you're most underpenetrated in or perhaps where your offerings
specifically would resonate best? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, so the focus – it depends on the business unit, the focus on the Private Client Group has been in the US,
Canada and the UK. We have unique offerings, I think, more or less in all those markets with the multi-affiliation
options, again, unique in Canada and in the UK. So, Charles Stanley was a perfect fit because there weren't
many people with not just the cultural heritage, but the multi-channel options. So, we are focused on the Private
Client Group of any type of opportunity in those three markets.
We're not really looking to expand in other markets in the private wealth business right now. And we just want to
focus on growing and competing well in those three markets. It's broader in the M&A category. It's the one

business that we do look at global opportunities both from a capital deployment – I mean the capital, for most [ph]
places, is just an office and (43:05) people versus capital is heavier in the other businesses. And it is a global
business. So, we will continue to look for opportunities. But, again, we've been focused in North America, the UK
and Europe, but we have looked at things in other places.
And then the rest of the businesses have to continue to be kind of North American and UK focused. So, we're not
– we don't – we have plenty of capital to grow. We think we're in strong positions in the UK. We had a very good
practice, but it was small and we think this acquisition would put us in a very competitive position where we can,
we think, accelerate the growth. So, that's been our focus and continues to be our focus. And we're not looking at
other kind of global markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then perhaps one for, Paul Shoukry, and forgive me as I'm still new to this story, but I
think you cited 21% around the tax rate into fiscal 4Q assuming a flat equity market. Can you perhaps just remind
me a little bit about, what some of the puts and takes that could kind of move that rate higher or lower as –
depending on, I suppose, the backdrop? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And welcome to the story. Glad to have you part of the coverage universe. Yeah, one of the biggest
drivers, and we can get into more detail offline, that impacts the tax rate quarter to quarter is we have a corporate-
owned life insurance portfolio, which we use to sort of fund some of our non-qualified benefits that we offer our
associates.
And so, the way that corporate-owned life insurance portfolio, those balances work is that when the equity market
appreciates, that typically results into non-taxable gains in that portfolio, which means that our effective tax rate,
all else being equal, is lower and vice versa when the equity market goes in the other direction, it results in non-
deductible losses, which means our effective tax rate, all else being equal, goes higher. So, typically the trend is
when the equity markets are up, our effective tax rate is lower and vice versa. Again, there's a lot of other factors,
but that is the factor that seems to be the most sort of volatile or impactful from quarter to quarter.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Hey, sorry, I hopped on a minute late here. So, apologies if I'm being a bit redundant. But on the recruiting
outlook, appreciate that it remains robust, but we've been hearing in the market that, on the employee side,
there's been kind of another maybe ratcheting up of competition packages. Are you guys seeing that? And I know
you had spoken about a few quarters ago kind of increases and then you took your offer up. So, I'm curious like,
are we hitting another level where competition is intensifying even more, so we may see more pricing pressure or
just higher packages? Just kind of curious what you're seeing in the market there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I can't really say that. I think that we've been so active in recruiting that [ph] we pretty get a good feel
(46:49) what everyone's doing. So, we said a few quarters ago that, where people have been ramping up for a
year and we had to make some adjustments. But I can't – it's competitive, there are – always it seems like an
outlier offer. This always seems to be an outlying offer here or there every time we recruit. But again, it's not how
we recruit. We give a competitive package, but often not the highest and stick to it. And again, the results have
been tremendous. So, I can't say – it's picked up a while ago and I can't say I've seen any difference in the last
couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. And then just a follow-up on acquisitions, I know a fair amount of color here this morning, but as
you think about some of the other types of acquisitions in wealth management that maybe aren't as traditional of
just buying a financial advisor franchise, are there other areas that could be interesting that you guys are looking
at, whether it be technology that accelerates growth in a new way or additional product capabilities?
Are there other types of things that you guys are looking at that I know are maybe a bit non-traditional for
Raymond James, but just kind of also strategically aligned with the M&A opportunity? It feels like there's maybe
even more to do than historically there has been some. I'm curious what you guys are seeing on that front as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, Devin, there is absolutely, we're looking at a lot of things. And one of the categories is firms
that offer new services or products that are extensions of what we're doing in [ph] WPFs (48:37), it's probably an
example of that. But also looking at technology firms that utilize technologies that really kind of propel the
businesses we're in. And we've been very active in that, too. So, it takes a lot of time because you have to find
them and then really understand how that technology works and fits and how it will really benefit our businesses,
whether it be complementary or maybe great to find something in that automated or revolutionized part of the
business, but those are harder to find.
But we're looking a lot at what I call technology backed or technology firms in our spaces that we think we could
utilize the technology to be a strategic client advantage and to make us more efficient and more electronic. So,
the answer is yes, we've been looking very hard at a number of opportunities. And again, we've been on the M&A
focus much more focused over the last year to two on those types of opportunities.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay, great. And if I can just squeeze one more in here, on the fixed income brokerage business in the Capital
Markets segment, obviously, it's been a very good environment for that business. Is there any way to give us any
more context around kind of the growth of that franchise? So, revenues have been expanding, a very good fiscal
2020, good start to fiscal 2021. And I think we get questions around the sustainability or kind of what normalized
looks like. And I know that's not necessarily easy to answer. But is there any frameworks around kind of how that
business has scaled, so the pie is expanding or the bar has moved higher because it's just a bigger business,
say, than it was two or three years ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
[ph] Yeah, certainly it has been a (50:29) unusual environment where both fixed income and equities have
produced records. So, that's – you've been going back in history, you can't find many windows like that. But
they've expanded both in products in the debt capital markets business over the last two years and other areas.
And we still continue to look in areas of fixed income and our sales and trading business, where we have strong
client bases, but not offering certain products and services. And I really don't want to go into what those are.
But we continue to look and round those out and that's been part of the growth, too, besides the robust markets
and they didn't have a record quarter, but they had a very strong quarter in chasing. When you're chasing records
all the time, you don't always set a record. But we're really pleased with what they've done and the franchise has
continued to grow and prosper. So, yeah, we think in all of our businesses, there are investment opportunities and
some are harder to find than others. But we continue to look. And I think there is room to grow.

William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you so much for taking the extra question. Just circling back to the investment bank, so momentum
seems very strong, I think your commentary qualitatively around the outlook also is very strong. Can you unpack
that a little bit more just in terms of just like the environment versus some of the added capabilities that you've
had? Also, I think at your Investor Day recently, you mentioned sort of getting to an aspirational goal of $1 billion
sort of the equity centric side. Seems like you might already be there just given the pacing here. But how to think
about maybe the incremental opportunity from here versus maybe some of the cyclical benefit we're getting from
the robust market backdrop? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, it's been a very strong market certainly both for us and our competitors and the environment of low debt
costs and high [ph] EPS (52:43) multiples and a lot of privately held firms or invested firms that – and their
portfolios that trade, so the backdrop's been very, very strong. But in addition to that, as Jim Bunn said, well,

we're doing well when the market's well, and I said you're not giving yourself enough credit for positioning for that
growth. So, not only has he been great at recruiting and building the teams, but we continue to do that. So, you
see Financo which just joined us, which has already scored a few deals of good size in a very short period of time
with us, and so they're not – their run rate is really not online.
We're very excited about Cebile and think that's a great growth business. And there are a few other verticals that
we are not well positioned and that we're looking to do the same things. And so, it's partly a market story. But
giving that team credit, it's also been a market positioning and share game which they have made and some
could argue we're undersized [ph] or sized (53:46), and that may be true, but they're certainly building and doing a
great job and I think continue to plan to do that. The market's just been a big added bonus to their plan.
