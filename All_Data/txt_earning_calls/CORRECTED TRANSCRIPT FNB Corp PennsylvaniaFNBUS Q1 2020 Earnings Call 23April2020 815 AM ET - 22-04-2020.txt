Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning and welcome to our earnings call. On today's call, I'd like to address three key topics. First, I'll
begin by providing an update on how we are navigating our business through the COVID-19 pandemic while
supporting our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. Secondly, I'd like to briefly comment on a
few points about our first quarter financial performance. And finally, I'd like to revisit several key strategic
initiatives and programs.
Our company's existing pandemic preparedness plan and ongoing pandemic exercises enabled FNB to stay at
the front of this escalating crisis. Dating back to 2018, our management team went through a pandemic simulation
and collaborated with our business continuity team to develop a formal pandemic response plan. During this
process, sustainability was thoroughly evaluated and ultimately formed the foundation of the comprehensive plan
currently in place.
Additionally, our ongoing commitment to invest in our digital channels and technology play the critical role in our
ability to provide convenient banking options for our customers who are not able to leave their homes. Our
investments in technology also enabled us to build and establish an automated process to handle nearly 15,000
business applications for the SBA Paycheck Protection Program in just one week's time. Our efforts resulted in
approving and processing 75% of those applications in the first round of funding, representing $2.1 billion in
loans. We anticipate processing the remaining applications during the second round of funding.
As I mentioned, when phase one of FNB's technology initiative called Clicks-to-Bricks began, we had previously
introduced online appointment setting and were able to quickly make specialized COVID-19 content and offerings
available in our solutions centers. We tapped into the strength of our established communication channels for
both customers and employees, keeping both audiences informed of any updates.
Our employees' response to this crisis has been exceptional. Their professional, compassionate, positive and
resilient attitudes have been a bright light in helping each other, our customers and our communities, while
navigating these unprecedented times. Protecting the health, safety and financial well-being of our employees
remains critical as we find ways to address any impacts to their health or the health of their families.
For example, FNB provided our team with up to 15 days paid leave and also expanded our existing paid caregiver
leave program additionally to assist with any possible financial hardships resulting from the coronavirus. FNB
provided a special assistance payment to essential employees working on the frontline and in our operations
areas to ensure that our customers continue to receive vital financial services.
We also leveraged our IT infrastructure by making accommodations to give employees the ability to work
remotely where appropriate. To date, we have approximately 2,200 colleagues working remotely which
represents about half of our workforce and largely nonretail position. This capability also speaks to our investment
in technology and IT infrastructure.
As we focus on our communities, the FNB Foundation committed to provide $1 million in relief in response to
COVID-19 benefiting food banks and providing essential medical supplies. Many of our employees began

reaching out to our clients and our communities to provide support. At our Pittsburgh headquarters, FNB's vendor
management team has been using our vetting process to assist Allegheny County and quickly researching new
vendors offering medical supplies and services to combat COVID-19.
With respect to our retail branches, we have focused on drive up services and closed our lobbies, reverting to
appointment-only practices, which are supported by the appointment setting capability within our Clicks-to-Bricks
platform. As you can imagine, the monumental commitment of our leadership team and employees to operate in
this challenging environment required a sustained 24x7 effort. I'd like to commend our employees for the actions
they've taken to execute and abide by our safety measures while continuing operations.
With these key priorities and actions in place, let me pivot and comment briefly on our first quarter performance.
Given all that's happened in a noisy quarter, our underlying core performance remains solid. Our philosophy is to
maintain our approach to risk management through varying economic cycles and serve as the primary capital
provider to our clients. While FNB, like many banks, will be subject to a difficult economic environment. This
philosophy and the actions we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce risk should position FNB
well as we move through the current crisis.
Looking at the quarter's results, GAAP EPS of $0.14 included $0.15 of bottom line impact from significant items
primarily related to COVID-19 and the adoption and implementation of CECL and the corresponding reserve build
under these macroeconomic conditions. Top line results were solid as revenue increased to more than $300
million driven by strong loan and deposit growth and positive results across our fee-based businesses.
Average commercial loans grew $225 million, or 6%, as we saw activity pick up in late-March, particularly in C&I
with growth of 17%. I'll note there was limited impact to average balances from the anticipated liquidity draws.
Compared to the first quarter of 2019, average deposits increased 5% with growth in noninterest-bearing deposits
of 7%, leading to an improved funding mix.
The net interest margin expanded to 3.14% supported by strong loan growth, a 7-basis-point improvement in total
cost of funds and higher accretion levels compared to the prior quarter. The fundamental trends in noninterest
income were strong with capital markets revenues of $11 million, setting another record in the first quarter.
Insurance and mortgage banking income also had strong underlying performance.
Due to the significant shift in the interest rate environment, our noninterest income includes $7.7 million of
impairment on mortgage servicing rights. Excluding changes in MSR valuation, mortgage banking income totaled
$6.7 million, up more than 50% from the first quarter of 2019 with significant pipelines moving forward.
On a core basis, expenses remain stable compared to the fourth quarter and disciplined expense management
will continue to be a top priority as we move beyond this crisis. Vince and Gary will provide more detail on the
implementation of CECL and additional details on the financials in their remarks.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.

Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We closed out the first quarter of 2020 with our credit portfolio
remaining in a satisfactory position in the midst of the current global challenges that have come as a result of
COVID-19. The first quarter also marked the adoption of the CECL accounting standard which as I communicated
last quarter brings additional changes to the reporting of credit quality metrics. I will also review the steps we are

taking to monitor the book and manage the emerging risks, while continuing to meet the credit needs of our
borrowers and the communities in which we operate.
Let's now review our first quarter results. The level of delinquency at March 31 totaled 1.13%, up 19 basis points
over the prior quarter and included a temporary uptick in early stage, a majority of which has already been
brought current. NPLs and OREO totaled 64 basis points, a 9-basis-point increase linked quarter. This increase
does not reflect credit deterioration, but rather changes in nonaccrual reporting moving from the former PCI pool
accounting to the new CECL standard.
Net charge-offs remained low at $5.7 million for the quarter, or 10 basis points annualized. Provision expense for
the quarter totaled $48 million, of which $38 million relates to the reserve build for adverse macroeconomic
conditions tied to COVID-19. The ending reserve stands at 1.44%, up 15 basis points compared to our day-one
CECL reserve of 1.29%, providing NPL coverage of 256% at quarter end. It's worth noting that inclusive of
unamortized loan discounts, our period ending reserve represents 66% of our 2018 DFAST severely adverse
scenario charge-offs.
Our teams have been working tirelessly over the last several weeks meeting with borrowers, reviewing credits,
tracking performance metrics and administering government-backed lending programs as part of our response to
the COVID-19 crisis. We entered the crisis with our credit portfolio in a position of strength, due in large part to our
core credit philosophies that I have discussed with you before, including consistent underwriting, proactive
management of risk, attentive and aggressive workout, and a balanced asset mix spanning our entire footprint.
We have taken many actions over the last several years to maintain a lower risk profile to position our book to
withstand various economic cycles and adverse conditions, similar to those we are currently experiencing. Over
the last four years, we have sold approximately $700 million in loans to proactively derisk the balance sheet, a
large portion of which were higher-risk acquired loans that we were able to move off the books at a financial
benefit to the company. We've also historically limited our exposure to highly sensitive industries like travel and
leisure, food and accommodation and energy with exposure to these three industries remaining very low, totaling
only 3.8% of our loan portfolio.
As it relates to relief programs, we were able to quickly mobilize our credit teams to review and approve payment
deferral plans for qualified borrowers, which to date totals approximately 6% of our loan portfolio. As an SBA
preferred lender, we have also been working diligently to support our small business borrowers in securing PPP
financing that is fully backed by the SBA. The volume and key performance metrics for these relief programs are
monitored daily through a specialized set of reports developed in response to COVID-19.
Using our holistic credit systems, we have been tracking daily utilization rates, deferral activity, PPP loan volume
and borrower impact assessments, which are broken down further to allow us to monitor our credit portfolio by
line of business, loan product, geography and industry. In addition to expanded analytics, we have also leveraged
our existing allowance and DFAST frameworks to conduct scenario analysis and stress testing, including select
loan portfolios. All of the actions taken will help us manage through the challenging conditions faced by the
industry today.
Above all, I would like to take a moment to recognize our team of bankers and credit support staffs for all of their
hard work and dedication to help meet the credit needs of our customers and communities during this challenging
time. We'll continue to draw on the leadership and experience of our credit and banking teams to manage through
this challenging environment as we have in past cycles.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our results for the first quarter and provide an
update on the current environment. As noted on slide 9 (sic) [slide 7] (00:13:17), first quarter GAAP EPS totaled
$0.14, which includes $0.15 of significant items. The TCE ratio ended March at 7.36%, reflecting 16 basis points
of CECL adoption impact and another 15 basis points for the $48 million of after-tax items. These significant items
are listed in the reconciliation tables with the biggest piece being the COVID-19 related reserve build of $38
million during the first quarter. We used a pandemic-driven recessionary scenario in evaluating the
macroeconomic projections.
Let's start with a review of the balance sheet on slide 14. Linked-quarter average loan growth totaled $278 million,
or 5% annualized, attributable to commercial growth of 6% and consumer growth of 2%. The average commercial
growth includes less than 1 percentage point annualized for COVID-19 related increases in commercial line
utilization that occurred in the month of March. Continuing on the balance sheet slide, on a linked-quarter basis,
average deposits were relatively flat as normal seasonal outflows impacted average balances. On a year-over-
year basis, average deposits were up $1.2 billion, or 5.2%.
From an overall liquidity standpoint, we are comfortable with our current position, including the benefit of
opportunistically accessing the debt capital markets to raise $300 million in holding company liquidity at very
attractive spreads on February 20. We also executed a portion of our previously announced share repurchase
program buying back 2.4 million shares prior to March 12 representing 0.7% of our total shares outstanding.
Turning to the income statement on slide 15, net interest income totaled $233 million, up $6.2 million or 2.7% from
last quarter. The net interest margin expanded 7 basis points to 3.14% driven by solid average loan growth, lower
cost of funds and higher discount accretion levels now that we are in a CECL environment. During the first
quarter, the higher discount accretion offset the pressure on variable rate loan yields, given the significant decline
in the short end of the curve. On the funding side, the total cost of funds decreased 7 basis points to 1.01% from
1.08% reflecting lower borrowing costs as well as a shift in funding mix and a 10-basis-point reduction in the cost
of interest-bearing deposits.
Slide 16 and 17 provide details for noninterest income and expense. There continues to be strong performance in
capital markets, mortgage banking, insurance and trust as well as for operating noninterest income as a whole.
As Vince noted earlier, we are consistently receiving positive contributions from our fee-based businesses, which
diversifies our revenue base and helps to mitigate the impact of a volatile interest rate environment.
Looking at the first quarter, noninterest income totaled $68.5 million, a 7.4% decrease from last quarter due
mainly to the impact from the $7.7 million MSR impairment given the move down in interest rates. Excluding the
impairment, noninterest income increased $2.2 million or 3% with capital markets posting a record $11.1 million,
increasing 29% from the fourth quarter driven by strong origination volume.
Turning to slide 17, noninterest expense on a run rate basis remains stable compared to fourth quarter levels.
This excludes $2 million of expenses associated with COVID-19, $8.3 million of branch consolidation costs, and
$5.6 million of expense related to changes in retirement provisions for new grants under our long-term incentive
program that do not affect the total cost of the grants, but do affect the expense recognition timing. Bank shares
and franchise taxes increased $1.7 million reflecting the recognition of a $1.2 million state tax credit in the prior
quarter and higher year-end 2019 bank capital levels, while other increases and decreases essentially offset each

other. The efficiency ratio equaled 59% compared to 56% as the other unusual or outsized items increased the
current quarter's efficiency ratio by over 3 percentage points.
Regarding guidance, the outlook we shared in January is no longer relevant, given the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on the overall economy and the uncertainty around the length of time it takes to recover. However, in
the spirit of transparency into our short-term forecasts, we are providing our current directional outlook for the
second quarter of 2020 on slide 18 based on what we know today, which is subject to change given the very fluid
situation we're all managing through. We expect second quarter net interest income to decline mid-single-digits
from first quarter levels as the net interest margin reflects the full quarter's impact of the current interest rate
levels.
We expect average loan balances to be up mid- to high-single-digits, reflecting higher March 31 spot balances
and $2.1 billion of PPP loans from the initial phase of the program that are expected to fund during the quarter.
The second phase of the program would be additive to these figures as we strive to accommodate all of our
customers that want to participate. We expect expenses to be flat from the core level of $178 million in this
quarter. We expect our core fee trends to continue from solid levels in the first quarter where service charges
expected to decline due to COVID- 19 impacts on certain products and services. We expect the effective tax rate
to be around 20%.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. I'd like to touch on several initiatives that stand out as we move forward. In January, we launched
our new interactive website designed with enhanced functionality that creates a one-stop shopping and interactive
digital experience. Online appointment setting, a streamlined account opening process and deploying interactive
teller machines throughout our footprint are just a few of the functionalities that our Clicks-to-Bricks digital strategy
affords us.
Combined with our network of nearly 40 ITMs and 550 ATMs and our robust award-winning mobile application,
we are well positioned to continue to provide service to our customers through multiple channels and meet their
needs during this time of social distancing and economic challenges. We've invested heavily in our mobile and
online platform, which is critical during a time of limited operations in the physical channels. Mobile deposits are
up more than 40% in the last two weeks of March compared to the year-ago period and pre-COVID-19 first
quarter levels. FNB will continue to build out our digital capabilities as previously planned.
To protect our customers and communities from economic disruption, FNB was one of the first banks to develop a
structured deferral program and announced several measures to support customers who may be enduring
financial hardships and were directly impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, we instituted an outreach program and
activated an outbound calling initiative to contact thousands of customers across all business units during the
crisis ensuring their needs were being met. We also continue to participate in the previously mentioned Paycheck
Protection Program and evaluate other COVID-19 related federal government relief programs to determine their
suitability for our customers and communities.
Regarding our outlook, liquidity and overall capital position, we consistently run stress test for a variety of
economic situations, including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like current conditions.
Under these scenarios, our regulatory capital ratios remain above the threshold and we are able to maintain
appropriate liquidity levels, demonstrating our ability to continue to support all of our constituencies under

stressful financial conditions. As we gain more clarity on this evolving health pandemic and the resulting
challenging economic environment, we will continue to update you on key business drivers and expectations.
In closing, I'd like to express how proud I'm of our team's efforts during this very difficult time to identify new and
creative ways to connect with those in need. This is an unprecedented time for our nation and our industry. Our
mission has always been to improve the quality of life in the communities we serve. Now more than ever, we must
work together to support those impacted by this public health crisis. As such, I want to again say thank you to our
employees and all those serving on the frontline in our communities who are making a difference as we navigate
through this together.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning, guys.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Jared.

Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
First, on the margin, you walk us through some of the moving parts as you look out into second quarter, I would
think that with the strong growth in PPP that would offset some of the pressure in second quarter. I guess, maybe
on the PPP, are you accounting for those fees or do you anticipate account for those fees through NII? And then,
what is the blended fee rate on the $2.1 billion that you have there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. I can make a few comments, Jared. So, just kind of walking through the outlook for the net interest income
going forward, as we've talked about it in the past, the changes in one-month LIBOR and prime have a significant
impact to our net interest income and margin. If you look at where our average LIBOR was for the last couple
quarters and projection for this quarter was 1.84% in the fourth quarter, 1.68% in the first quarter and projected to
be around 0.70% on average for the second quarter. We have $8.5 billion in LIBOR-based loans and another
$2.9 billion as prime-based. So, the projected move down, obviously, impacts those loan portfolios.
Now, offsetting the impact, we continue to reduce the rates on our interest-bearing deposit costs as we've talked
about. We're projecting another 33-basis-point reduction in the second quarter from first quarter levels. And then,

we will have benefits as you mention from the PPP program as we fund this quarter. The $2.1 billion, you'll have
our average fee rate we're estimating is around 3% is how that would kind of calculate out when you go through
the tiering. The spread is 65 basis points, so kind of an all-in margin is around 2%, 2.25% for those loans. The
way we're going to account for it is you put them on the loan system kind of loan by loan, so it's accreted in over a
two-year period, and then once the loans are forgiven and paid off, you would bring in the remainder of the fees
into interest income at that point in time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then lastly, the last piece I would comment on to is just the accretion that we had this quarter [indiscernible]
(00:24:27) through in kind of a CECL environment versus the pre-CECL environment. So, it was about $17 million
this quarter. It's up about $7 million from the fourth quarter. So, that contributed to the first quarter. I don't expect it
to be quite at that level in the second quarter, but I don't know, because it's a function of prepayments and with –
under the CECL accounting, there's a lot more variables that get factored into that with prepayments being a big
contributor. So, I still expect it to be a meaningful contributor in the second quarter, just not quite at that – as high
as that $17 million. If you look at the last – third and fourth quarter of last year, we were running 10 to 12 basis
points from accretion. It's probably a reasonable run rate, subject to change, based on what happens with
prepayments during the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Jared, a couple of other points on the PPP program. Of the 15,000 applications that we brought in, we have
kind of originated an average loan size of about $180,000. So, we're on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of
size with more small businesses coming through that pipeline. We still have 25% that are still out there, that totals
about $650 million that we processed and are ready to be processed in round two once the funds are available,
and we would expect some additional fundings on top of that, just in the spirit of transparency. We've also funded
about 90% of the $2.1 billion already. So, they're closed and on the books.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. On the loan growth this quarter, did I hear you right, did you say that there is only 1% of the growth was
from increased line utilization or was that line utilization went up 1%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. It was 1% on average, right. So, the line utilization occurred later in March that we would have had. So, on
average, it's 1% of the 5% growth that I mentioned, the average balance growth.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Yeah. Hey, Jared, I can add to Vince's comments there. Our usage was running around 42%, a little over 42%
prior to the COVID impact. It peaked at just under 47% as businesses build some cash positions. We're already
back down to 43.8%, so it's really getting close back to a normalized level at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But we really don't have a significant amount of large corporate exposure that essentially was funded up either to
put liquidity on their balance sheet or to back up commercial paper offerings. We don't have a tremendous
amount of that in our portfolio. So, the liquidity draws were much lower than what others would have reported.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. And then just finally for me, the – sorry, on the deferrals, you said that 6% of total loans are
in deferral. Are you seeing any concentration in either category of loan or geography?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Right now, we're at about 5%. We expect with the pipeline to be at about 6% or just a touch over 6% based
on the pipeline that we have. In terms of those deferrals, we're seeing those in the industries that you would
expect, restaurant, travel tourism. Those books are very small from our perspective as we've strategically really
not had a focus on lending into that space as we've talked in the past. So, it's really concentrated kind of there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And if you look at the dispersion of deferrals, it's all – it's pretty similar across the loan types in terms of
percentage or the size of the portfolio, right, Gary? I mean, it's ranging around 2.5% – 2% to 2.9% is pretty much
where it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A

Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

So, it's pretty consistent that we're not seeing a spike in one particular area.

balance sheet over the last number of years, like I mentioned earlier, and we're coming off some very solid
charge-off levels over the last 18 months. Naturally, the world has changed. We expect that consistency in the
underwriting that we talked about with you all the time on the frontend to play a meaningful role as we go forward
here. In terms of charge-offs, all banks are going to experience credit deterioration as is typical in any downturn
and this one is rather severe at this point.
In our last stress test, we remained well capitalized and expect to be able to fully execute our business plan from
a charge-off standpoint under those adverse scenarios. And to the extent that the forecasted economic conditions
under the CECL methodology are worse, then COVID-19 conditions are at this point that we used at March 27
day, so we're using some very current COVID information around our modeling. We would expect any potential
reserve build to occur from normal levels based on movements from this point in time. So, from a loss
perspective, we're not going to forecast losses as we go forward, but we do expect the portfolio to perform as well
as possible through the cycle that we're dealing with right now based on the consistency that we've talked about
in the underwriting.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And if you got to page 13 in the deck, Frank, there is a comparison on FNB's performance, our net charge-
offs over average loans back historically. Gary, maybe you could comment on that. I mean, it does exclude
Regency and the Florida portfolio that we divested.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So, back in the 2009 and 2010 Great Recession that we all experienced a numbers of years ago, on page
13 you see FNB's performance through that cycle. This is basically the core bank at that point in time, it did
exclude – it does exclude Florida and Regency as those portfolios are now no longer a part of the company's
balance sheet. That consistent underwriting that we had in place back then remains today and we do expect that
that will allow us to perform better than the industry as a whole as this cycle moves through itself.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then, just back to the margin and NII guide for 2Q, Vince. I'm sorry, does that include any accretion in
NII expectations or – I don't know, have you left yourself enough – wide enough range there, just curious?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. It would include my comment earlier about kind of 10 to 12 basis points. If you look at the third and fourth
quarter kind of run rates which were pre-CECL, I would expect that to be kind of more normal run rate next
quarter, right. Again, it's a function of prepayments though, prepayments end up being high again we would have
more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, I think it's kind of a reasonable number I would say, Frank, and I truly won't know until the kind of quarter
plays itself out. But there's definitely that kind of 10 to 12 basis points in there for the second quarter. That's
baked into our number. And then, also I should clarify too that we mentioned the $2.1 billion in the PPP activity,
that's on the books for two months of the quarter, so you don't have two-one, you have two-thirds of that, just from
a modeling standpoint, and that's included in the number too into the target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. But I guess what wouldn't be included is if they are only on the books for two months – well, I guess it's late
in the quarter, so you don't have anything from the 3% being accelerated, because some of the stuff is going to be
forgiven, nothing like that is in 2Q.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. I can give you an overview of that. We're using the pandemic recession scenario where we see significant
deterioration in the economy upfront with slight improvement later in the year and then a continued economic
weakness throughout 2021. We're not taking into account in our analysis any of the government stimulus
programs around our modeling. So, there is no benefit from any of that. We review and incorporate really about a
dozen variables just like we always have in the DFAST modeling scenarios that we continue to run and those
variables include a few examples I'll give you, such as the Dow housing, consumer confidence levels, GDP and
unemployment are a number of the examples there, but that's really what's driving our models and the analysis
that we've done around the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
And I would assume that was time-stamped kind of end of March. So, conditions maybe have worsened a little bit
since then, if we stay on kind of a similar trajectory that would require more reserve build potentially next quarter
just to stay on where we stand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We continue to run these scenarios. We've run them as recent as the last couple days based on the update.
Again, our model was run as of the March 27 timeframe. And as of our most recent run with the updated data, it's
really not a material difference, albeit slightly, but nothing material based on just simulated models that we're
running.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And Gary, I think you've done a great job on the slide here breaking out kind of all the COVID sensitive
industries, et cetera. Are there any areas that we should be particularly watchful of or that you think may have
more near-term risk than others, whether it'd be less liquidity, less cash or more severely impacted collateral?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say that from an industry standpoint, naturally restaurants are severely impacted. Hotels are
severely impacted. Energy is in a tough spot right now also being impacted. These are some of the categories,
specifically hotels and the energy, we do have a small restaurant book and some very good clients there, we
started lending into the hotel space 4.5 years ago. It was a strategic decision and it's proven to be a very good
one. We've got some assets, as we've talked in the past, from the acquisitions. We have derisked that portfolio
and not been active in lending into that at all.
As for energy, I mean you can see by the slide deck, I mean we're not an energy lender. We got a few customers
that are very sound as well as a few publicly traded entities there that continue to perform well. But those are the
industries that I would be initially concerned about as we're in the early stages here and with all the uncertainty
that everyone is still facing that have the potential to become a more problematic at a faster pace. Again,
strategically, we've positioned ourselves and made decisions over time to maintain very, very small portfolios
there and I think that's going to pay dividends for us as we move through this cycle.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I think in the past, we disclosed our energy related exposures back a few years ago, right, Gary, when there
was a downturn. I think it was about three, maybe four years ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We've cut that exposure in half. So, I mean, I think it's pretty evident that we've not been active in these areas. I
think you should comment on the retail exposure as well, because as you look at operations, in the current
environment, I mean it's difficult for many retailers. If you look at the granularity of our book as well on the retail
side, there are some segments within retail that are going to continue to perform, right, grocery, there's a number
of them in here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And I think that's an important point as well, Vince, because that – naturally there are concerns there. A key
point here, the grocery, gas station, automotive, that makes up two-thirds of our retail C&I book. So, that's a
heavy dose of it, a number of those industries have remained open as essential industries. So, we feel fairly good
about the position of our retail book coming into this as well as working its way through a soft spot here from an
economic standpoint.

down? Just trying to get a sense as to what kind of balance sheet we can expect on the second quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It will probably be a little lighter than that, because the investment portfolio, we actually shrank during the
quarter just given reinvestment. I think we reduced it almost $200 million to $191 million during the first quarter.
So, my guess is the cash flow on that is $1.6 billion over 12 months. So, I would expect that to kind of run down a
little bit from there, again, a function of prepayments. I mean, we're doing some investing, just not fully reinvesting
the cash flow. So, the earnings assets would be a little bit lower than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think you want to remember the balances – the depositary balances for us are seasonal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

[indiscernible] (00:41:46) so it will build over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, understood. And just on the loan growth, I mean because $2.1 billion is – I mean, that's 7% of the earning
asset base in the first quarter here. And I know you had some line draws towards the end of the quarter, so you're
bleeding in positively on a core loan growth basis into the second quarter. But what is the expectation for – and it
sounds like that utilization has come down. So, I guess my point is, what is the core loan book, what's the
expectation for core FNB loans outside of PPP in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think it's a little tough to tell at this stage in the game. I mean, I think we've got a good solid customer
base. We're not seeing a lot of movement. I don't think anybody is really eager to move at this point. So, I would
expect us to – I would expect the balances that we have today to be pretty solid. I think that the pipeline is still
pretty good, but like I said, we're kind of in a standstill, because you can't really visit prospects. I know that we are
winning business in the marketplace for a number of reasons. I think our execution on PPP was extraordinarily
good relative to what I've seen. We had a capture rate on our customers alone of 80% and we had about 10%
new customers when we opened it up to new customers initially. So, the execution has been good and the
comments have been pretty favorable. So, I would expect, after this all starts to settle down later in the year that
there will be acceleration in activity. I don't know what else to – I don't know if you want to add anything, Gary,
or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, Casey, we've seen some good steady business throughout the last month, month-and-a-half from
our client base. I mean, they're still investing specifically around some certain investments that they had planned.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
A few of them have temporarily held those off, but we've seen some pretty decent lending activity right through
the last month-and-a-half or so at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And it's – obviously, you have to be careful, because we're in the midst of a crisis and we understand the impact
that could have on financial performance of the borrower. So, we're being cautious, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...we're – I think we're positioned pretty well as we move through this crisis on the other side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And the TCE ratio at 7.40% at the quarter, I know that PPP could put some pressure on that and it
carries a zero risk weighting, but you guys are a little bit more levered than most on that ratio. What is your
appetite? How low are you willing to get that ratio – let that ratio go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we're supposed to be growing that. So, that was our strategy prior to the crisis. I think we're – again, I think
our capital position relative to the risk in the portfolio is good. I think that we've mentioned we've stressed our
capital position in a variety of scenarios, including the pandemic scenario that Gary mentioned. So, I feel pretty
good about that. I would expect as we move into the future to see an acceleration in the benefit of the fee income
really helping us in the third quarter in terms of capital build, because I think that you'll see an acceleration
hopefully in forgiveness on these loans as people comply with the requirements that will be laid out. I mean
they're not out there yet, but will be laid out. So, I think all of that keeps us in a pretty good place from a TCE
perspective and tangible book value per share perspective. Vince, I don't know if you want to add anything or
have I missed anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just add a couple things. I mean absent the PPP impacts, we would expect that ratio to be slowly
building on a quarterly basis to your point, that was – it was building. So, I think it's important to remember that
that's kind of what's underneath. The temporary impact of – the $2.1 billion brings us down just under 7%. We're
comfortable with that for all the reasons that Vince mentioned and the strength of the balance sheet. And then,
whatever happens in phase two, as far as the funding, that would incrementally bring you down from there. But $2
billion brings you from basically 7.36% to 6.95%, so it's about 21 basis points or so for a $1 billion worth of those
loans. And again, they're temporary, and as you know, they don't affect the regulatory ratios at all, but they do
affect the TCE ratio. So, we're comfortable with that temporary level and then kind of rebuilding from there once
those loans go back off the books.

Okay. Thanks. Just last one for me. Gary, apologies if I missed this on your script, but the forbearance and the
modifications, can you give us a sense, has that – at 6%, has that reached a peak and similarly like the line draws
that they peaked and then they came back down, just trying to get a sense for the pace of forbearance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Just to clarify, Casey, we're at about 5% right now, and with the pipeline, we're anticipating that it's going to
get to just a touch over 6%. It has slowed dramatically. At this point, we do expect a continued trickle there, but it
has slowed dramatically from a commercial borrower perspective. We're still working through some of the
mortgage portfolios at this point, but that has also slowed as we sit today.

perspective as to where LTVs and debt service coverage stands? And then, the follow-up would be, you

mentioned internal stress tests that you're performing. Just curious as to what type of loss rates you would be
assuming within those three at-risk buckets as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of the industries from an LTV standpoint, generally speaking, you're going to see 70%, low-70%
range around LTVs around those spaces and that's going to run fairly consistent across to our portfolio. What was
the second piece of the question, Russell?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E.T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Just any detail you could share, Gary, in terms of the internal stress testing that you mentioned in your comments
and assumed loss rates within some of the more at-risk portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Okay. Vince is going to cover that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just say, Russell, I mean that we wanted to put that 66% out there. So, just to restate what was in
Gary's note, so if you include the unamortized loan discounts, our period end reserve at March 31 is 66% of the
severely adverse charge-offs over nine quarters from the last stress test that we did, just to put it in perspective
that it's a significant reserve against those charge-offs. And we haven't really disclosed all the different pieces or
the different loss rates, but what I can tell you is we hit it very hard in that severely adverse scenario and have
every time we've done it.

Just to stick to the credit discussion for a second. So, if we kind of assume, Gary, you mentioned kind of 6% of –
you're seeing in terms of deferrals right now, I guess that's like $1.4 billion. Do you know how much of those
deferrals would be included in that, I guess, roughly $3.5 billion of sort of COVID-sensitive loans that you classify
in slide 11?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of the deferred loans in the retail IRE book, it's a total of $470 million, the food and
accommodation is about $75 million, and let me find the lodging here, the lodging is about $175 million, and the
retail right at about $145 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, the rest is just – I'm guessing just smaller granular numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A

That's correct, Collyn.

Collyn B. Gilbert Q

Okay. Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then, just wanted to clarify Vince on the NIM, just to make sure I got
these numbers right. So, the actual accretion dollar amount that you guys saw this quarter was what, if we
compare that to like the $9.6 million you guys saw in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

Okay. Okay. So, then on the core NIM basis, is that – I guess that would imply maybe then the core NIM fell about
4 bps in the first quarter, is that right the core NIM would settle out at like 2.90%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. If you excluded that – I mean it's kind of all in there, right, as we go forward into CECL environment. So, the
$17 million, I'm trying to think of a – hang on a second. Yeah. I guess that's about...

Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, got it. Okay. And then just lastly on kind of the loan growth discussion, I'm trying to reconcile, Gary, kind of
your comment about the pipeline and you still have some customer activities still flowing through. But yet,
obviously, there's a lot of activity that also come to kind of a screeching halt. But then, just thinking about kind of I
guess capital markets, it sounds like – I mean you obviously had a great quarter in capital markets this quarter
and it sounds like the expectation there based on your guidance is that that those levels should hold into this
quarter. So, I'm just trying to understand, I guess you're seeing there's a visible pipeline there that would cause
you to say that or just trying to reconcile maybe the thought that activity would start to slow pretty meaningfully
there. So, just trying to understand why you still have – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think you have to look at fee income in total, Collyn, because the mortgage bank is – their pipeline is
huge, so – and they took the big impairment, I don't anticipate – I'm not sure what's going to happen with interest
rates.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't want to forecast. But I would expect that their fee income in the next quarter would be significantly higher.
And then, you have the SBA business outside of the PPP program that had a pretty solid pipeline going into this
situation. And then, there's a lot of activity. The first two months of March were pretty darn good from an
origination perspective for us across the geographies. So, I would expect that capital markets activity would
continue into next quarter. I can't predict at what level, but I would expect it to continue, because there are a
number of companies that would like to fix their debt and there are several deals that we were working through
from the syndications perspective. So, again, there's a lot of uncertainty, we're trying to do the best we can with
the forecasting, but we were looking pretty good going into this.

Good morning.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Good. I just wanted to circle back on the PPP income recognition. So, I just want to better understand why
would I guess we pushed out to 3Q, because just from an accrual accounting perspective, you did most of the
activity here early in the second quarter and then there's the eight-week period which gets us to sort of the
beginning weeks of June. And so, I would think that you have a sense for at least for round one, what's been
utilized by June and so what will be forgiven. And just so why would you accrue for that in 2Q as opposed to 3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, there's a process. They still have to put out the guidelines on the forgiveness as to how that process is going
to work, Brody. So, you're really not going to know with certainty that every single loans will get that forgiveness,
they're all 100% guaranteed. So, from a risk standpoint, you're covered there, but from a kind of loan accounting
standpoint, you can't really bring in the unamortized or unaccreted fee until the loan is forgiven and paid off. So,
since you don't know with certainty that all 100% of those are going to be forgiven when they go through that, still
to be defined SBA process, that's why and it will accrete some of it in, but the full amount really doesn't come in
until the loan is truly paid off and then you would bring it in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I'd say given the size of our client coming through, I mean, the last batch that we funded was under
$100,000. So, I think that there's going to be [indiscernible] (00:55:57). We have more small businesses that
we've brought through here. Our average is way lower than many out there. So, the timing of when that they
prepare the information to get forgiveness [indiscernible] (00:56:09) on the process that we don't have yet is a big
question mark. So, I think for us, it's going to be maybe a little slower because the customers aren't as
sophisticated, right. So, it might take them a little longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, plus there is an eight-week period that's baked into that, Brody, right.

So, you first have to wait till after eight weeks and then you have to follow whatever the process is that the SBA
lays out as far as how it's going to work. So, that gets you through June 30, gets you into third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q

Right. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. They're matching the fee up with the loan on a per loan basis and then kind of baking it into the yield I
guess. So, it will show up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No. You got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to go back, Gary, you said you've 5% of loans on deferral right
now, expect to get up to about 6%, just given what's in the pipeline. So, that's about $1.4 billion. You are – I guess
in the slide deck, you are starting with 90-day deferrals for these customers, but FASB and the regulators have
sort of given leeway to get up to 180 days deferral periods. Do you expect to go there for the bulk of these loans
or are you seeing – I guess like, if you could give some color on the type of borrower that's taking advantage of
the deferrals, are you're seeing a mix between borrowers that actually need it and maybe some borrowers that
are pretty strong and maybe just want some extra liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We are seeing that and what I can tell you, Brody, is a significant piece of the – a significant percentage of the
commercial borrowers which we've offered interest-only payments to essentially deferring the principal-only or a
full deferral, we are very heavy on the interest-only side of that equation. So, the borrowers are choosing north of
70% of the time to pay the interest and just defer the principal. So, I think that speaks to the quality of the
borrower and the portfolio that's looking for deferrals here. I think they are looking for to preserve cash and
deferrals are available, so they're taking advantage of that appropriately.
As far as the 180-day is concerned, we will support borrowers that need it for an additional 90 days. So, we will be
working with those borrowers as we go forward. I would expect the restaurant industry would be an industry that
would need an additional 90 days as potentially that hotel industry as well. So, primarily, I think they're going to be
heavily focused there.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Okay. That's great color. And the reason I'm asking is just I'm trying to gauge whether or not you would expect to
see a significant increase in your accrued interest receivable line item which just based on the fact that 70% of
your commercial borrowers are continuing [indiscernible] (00:59:20) I'm assuming that you don't expect to see
your accrued interest receivable to more significantly higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I guess it will be capitalized into the loan, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right. No, we don't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Yeah. I just because – I guess I'm wondering like, would some of these borrowers, like where you're
accruing interest or maybe you're not necessarily receiving it, that will get capitalized into the loan balance maybe
on the backend, but I'm assuming that that would flow into your accrued interest receivable in the interim, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But not if you're capitalizing it. If you're capitalizing it, it becomes part of the loan balance.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And you had – you mentioned the 66% – the current reserve would be 66% of the 2018 DFAST in the
severe loss scenario, so that severe loss sort of is to about $520 million, perhaps just doing the math. Is that a
one-year loss scenario or is that spread out over multiple years in that stress test?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's over nine quarters, the way you do the stress tests. So, that's cumulative losses over a nine quarter period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
So, it sounds like just based on that and just given what the PPNR run rate is that you wouldn't even need to dip
into the reserve, because PPNR would more than cover the losses. Is that fair to say?

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. And then, Vince, you mentioned an interesting stat, mobile deposits being up 40% in the last two weeks.
And I know that the situation is fluid, but that's a pretty big number. And so, I just wanted to better understand, has
anything happened in the last month or so that changed how you're thinking about [indiscernible] (01:01:36) like
are there any geographies where customer behavior has surprised you in terms of mobile adoption during this
timeframe or you hadn't previously considered branch cutting and now maybe you're thinking about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we've cut a lot of branches, in fact we cut 16 leading up to this, we probably would have left them open had
we not already gone down the path. What I'm finding – what's interesting is that we're still seeing about 65% of
the normal volume in the branches from a transaction perspective. So, what that's telling me is that, while people
are willing to use remote capture, and that's remote capture end to end, so that could be small businesses,
instead of going to the branch using their device in their office, it's mobile, people using their mobile device like I
mentioned and we increased the limits to permit more checks to flow through there. I would expect and what
28

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
we've witnessed is a number of customers that may have been older that weren't using our online and mobile
products are now signing up for it. So, we're walking them through it in the branches.
So, I would expect adoption of those products to be accelerated. We've significantly reduced the number of
branches. I think we're getting to the point where the [ph] dispersion (01:02:55) of those branches is good. And if
we continue to cut at this rate, without making some sort of capital investment in the delivery channel, it will begin
to erode our ability to grow. So, we're looking at that, and what I mean by that is we're going to have to be
strategic about closures. We may have to build a new facility and take two out in an area where we can
accommodate that consolidation, but it requires CapEx spend. That's where we are I think in the evolution of
branch closures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, a couple real quick ones [indiscernible] (01:03:35)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The other thing I will mention is we also saw a significant uptick in ITM transactions, obviously. So, we've about
40 ITMs, the Interactive Teller Machine, where you can actually speak to a human being, cash a check down to a
penny. They've been – the utilization on those has increased in the last several weeks. Again, the more
comfortable consumers become using these devices and the equipment, I think that bodes well for the future in
terms of utilization, which could lead to more efficiency in the branches from an HR perspective. So, there's other
ways to look at it, but it's a good question and I appreciate the question. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. And then, one last one for me just with capital, I'm just assuming the buybacks are on hold, I'm sorry if you
said that and I missed it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Most of my stuff has been covered, but maybe I just – back to the PPP for just a minute, Gary or I guess
maybe Vince. And so, if you talk about the 3% rate and you talk about the $2.1 billion, just so I understand the –
what you're talking about as far as when the benefit is realized or how you guys were thinking about it, just given
there's not a lot of disclosure on it or how you're going to do that. If you take 3% and you're talking $60 million and
you kind of – as you recognize that the next couple quarters or at least kind of what you guys are thinking about,
can you give any sense for just how that $60 million, just on the fee part, not the spread part, as you're thinking
about it today would flow through from a high level perspective, how much of the benefit in second and third
quarter or in third and fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It would come in over the two years, Brian, absent stuff – once it's forgiven then you would bring in
whatever is left, it's accounted for loan by loan. So, basically the figure you quoted, the 60-ish, which is what the
math would work out to be, it just gets spread over the two-year period, which is the life of the loans, the stated
life of the loans I guess I should say. And then, what we were saying earlier is that, the way that process we
expect it to work, the loans are not going to be forgiven until you get into the third quarter when they will get paid
off, and then we would bring whatever is left on each loan that's forgiven, you would bring that into income during
the third quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, I quote it like a 2.25% kind of all-in yields that we would have is what was kind of baked in for the second
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the – I guess, as it relates to the balance sheet and capital, I
mean Gary, you talked about the loans you sold – the assets you sold over the last couple years. Is there
anything, I guess, you would consider – I guess is that something you guys are thinking about now, any other
asset sales here going forward or is that not really something you're thinking about today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We're constantly looking at the balance sheet, Brian, and we don't have anything positioned at all that we
have any interest in selling at this point. That being said, we're always looking at the mortgage portfolio. So, if
there would be anything, it would just be a normal cut type of mortgage pool that would be sold, but nothing other
than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And it would be a challenge. I mean, we sold those portfolios during a more robust time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, I think – and we were able to get out of those exposures in most cases at a premium. And I go back, I reflect
back on the calls, I know we were under tremendous pressure to grow revenue, but Gary made this strategic
decision to exit certain classes – asset classes, hospitality was a large component of those loans that were sold
and they were past credits in many instances. So, I think we've taken a big bite out of the apple in terms of risk
management. And if you look back getting out of Regency, moving away from certain mortgage products that we
decided to sell, looking at the credit portfolios, the acquired portfolios that had a heavy concentration in hospitality
and other areas that we didn't have an appetite for, we packaged and sold, and we sold them at a time when you
could get a gain on the sale, because there was more certainty at that time.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Credit spreads were narrower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The other thing I would add around that, Brian, is our workout team. We've really strengthened it over the
course of the last two, two-and-a-half years and they have been doing some tremendous work moving assets off
the books that we want off the books and we're seeing that continue today. So, we're benefiting from that as well
and that's something that is a core focus of the company and we'll continue to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. No. That's helpful and that looks like a great move. So, just a last one for me, just on the fee
income part, just two questions, did I hear you right that – I know the service charges went down this quarter, but
you would expect them to go down further? And just if you gave any color on, just given the market conditions,
how you're thinking about the wealth and the trust business today, if that's also comes under pressure, you
already saw some of that or are you seeing any of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I'll do the last part and then I'll go back to the forecast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Okay. All right. Yeah. I guess what I would say the guidance that we have there is just expecting kind of core
noninterest come to be stable from where we were, except for the weaker service charges. I mean we do expect
– we've seen some increased waivers, not a big number, I mean less than $1 million that we've seen in say the
first four weeks of this. So, there's some impact there and then there's just less activity. So, the comment was that
expecting to see weaker service charges on the deposits transaction. So, that will kind of run against what's
happening in the other businesses.
We're still looking for strong contributions. When you look at the noninterest income slide that we have in the
deck, I mean you could see the movement up year-over-year and versus the fourth quarter in trust, insurance,
securities commissions, capital markets, was all very strong. I mean the percentage growth versus both fourth
quarter and first quarter a year ago is up very nicely and we've invested in those businesses, we've continued to
build out the teams there. So, I think those contributions have been very important to mitigate the interest rate
impacts. And then, mortgage, we would expect to, without an MSR impact this quarter, we would expect that
number to kind of come back to a normal, normal good solid level in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But from an earnings perspective, if you're speaking about net asset values declining because of the overall
market decline, I would not expect that to be meaningful or material.
