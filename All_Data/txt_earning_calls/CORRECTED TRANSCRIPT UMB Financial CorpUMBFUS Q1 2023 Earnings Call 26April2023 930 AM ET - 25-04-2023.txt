Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Thank you, Kay, and good morning. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. 2023 is certainly shaping up to be an
interesting year. We've all had a front-row seat to the recent volatility across the industry, sparked by the failure of
SVB and exacerbated by a few market participants and the media. While the events of the past several weeks
that put banks in the spotlight may not have been anticipated, trends in the latter part of 2022 and early 2023
have pointed to coming challenges.
We expected the continuing inflation, changes in the yield curve, the outflows of excess liquidity built up during
the pandemic and the resulting deposit beta acceleration in response to the FOMC, raising an unprecedented 9
times in the last 12 months would likely present some inherent, but manageable risks to the industry.
By design, this would also lead to eventual curtailment of credit and the slowing of the economy. At UMB, we're
always prepared for different environments with our variable asset base; diverse, deeply entrenched deposit
base; ample sources of liquidity; growing fee income businesses; and a long track record of conservative
underwriting, resulting in excellent asset quality. And we've taken the additional steps to enhance that risk profile
over the past few weeks.
Even with the more challenging environment in March, we had a strong first quarter. Like others, we saw rising
deposit costs, which were already beginning to materialize before the recent market turmoil. The flexibility we've
built on the asset side of our balance sheet, including a low loan-to-deposit ratio, 67% of total loans repricing
within 12 months and nearly $1.6 billion of securities cash flow expected over the same time will help mitigate this
impact on liability pricing.
Our first quarter results included average deposit growth of 2.4% and average loan growth of 19.3% on a linked-
quarter annualized basis. We had continued momentum in our fee businesses and credit quality remains
excellent with net charge-offs of just 0.09% of average loans. Nonperforming loans further improved from year
end, and we're at just 0.07% of total loans as of March 31.
As you'll see in our 10-Q, criticized loans were flat. Our watch list levels, which are still passed loans will bounce
around as we manage our book. We're quick to recognize trouble, take action and address any issues. This
proactive management has been consistent, and historically, we've seen very little migration to loss.
Turning to the balance sheet. The drivers behind our 19.3% linked-quarter annualized growth and average loan
balances this quarter are on slide 24. Total top line loan production, as shown on slide 25 with $934 million for the
quarter. Payoffs and paydowns represent 3.3% of loans in the first quarter. The average for the past five quarters
was just under 4%, in line with our longer-term trend. Commercial real estate and construction growth in the first
quarter came predominantly from industrial and multifamily categories.
This quarter, we provided additional disclosures on our CRE portfolio in our line of business section on slide 37
and 38. Credit quality is strong across our book and the portfolio is well-diversified by property classification,
tenant type and geography.
As it relates to office CRE, our portfolio of just under $1 billion represents just 4.5% of total UMB loans. The
average size of an office credit is $8.2 million, and approximately 70% of the portfolio matures in 2025 or later.
The office portfolio is 82% recourse and has a weighted average loan-to-value of approximately 65%. The smaller
non-recourse portion has a lower LTV ratio of 61% and is either leased to credit tenants' long term or with our
strongest sponsors. We've generally limited our office lending to our strongest and most experienced sponsors.
And we adhere to conservative standards, which include underwriting to imputed or stressed interest rates and
moderate loan-to-value ratios.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
The majority of our office portfolio is located within UMB's Midwestern footprint, and we have no office exposure in
major coastal markets. Given our Midwestern focus, our borrowers are seeing continued leasing interest and
increasing return-to-office activity. This is supported by the makeup of our portfolio which is 55% in suburban
office parks and an additional 17% in medical offices. We continue to monitor the portfolio closely and stay ahead
of any emerging risks.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we see opportunities in our various verticals across the footprint. We will
continue to remain disciplined on our pricing and further emphasizing lendings that come with deposit
relationships. On the other side of the balance sheet, average deposits increased 2.4% on an annualized basis
compared to the fourth quarter. As we shared earlier in our 8-K, since March 9, balances increased more than $1
billion through quarter end. For comparison purposes, the peers who have reported through the end of last week,
reported a median increase in average deposits just over 0.05%.
Looking at DDA, we saw a shift of less than half of what our peers reported. Importantly, as we point out each
quarter, activity in our commercial and institutional customer base differentiates us from our peers with larger
retail customer bases. On any given day, and particularly at month end and quarter end, deposit balances
fluctuate for normal business purposes such as payroll, dividends and other expected activity. This is why we
focus on average balances over the quarter.
Slides 30 and 31 show the composition and the characteristics of our deposit portfolio. We have a very diverse
deposit base across various industries, lines of business and geographies. 55% of our deposit accounts span 10
years or more. Additionally, we have deep business relationships with depositors, with many using other products
and services such as asset servicing, corporate trust, payments and treasury management.
Uninsured deposits, adjusted to exclude affiliate and collateralized deposits were 43% of total deposits as of
March 31. We have the opportunity to reduce this ratio even further, as much as 10 points by using sweeps.
Additionally, we continue to enhance our already strong contingent liquidity sources, while increasing our
proportion of insured deposits. As a result, our liquidity covered approximately 116% of uninsured deposits as of
April 20.
Lastly, before I turn it over to Ram, I'd like to mention that I've appreciated the efforts of the research analyst
community, including those of you on this call. You've made an effort to educate market participants and avoid
contributing to unfounded fears. Ram?

Thanks, Mariner. I'll share a few additional drivers of our first quarter results, then I'll discuss some of the key
balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities, liquidity and
capital.
Net income for the first quarter was $92.4 million or $1.90 per share. Operating pre-tax, pre-provision EPS for the
quarter was $2.78 per share compared to $2.44 for the first quarter of 2022. Net interest income decreased 1.4%
versus the fourth quarter, as the positive benefit from asset repricing and the benefit from loan growth was offset
by the mix shift in liabilities and the impact of fewer days in the quarter.
Net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.76%, a decrease of 7 basis points from the linked quarter. Drivers
included negative impacts of approximately 51 basis points from deposit pricing and mix; and 16 basis points

related to changes in Fed funds purchased, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowing levels. Offsets
include a positive 34 basis points from loan mix and repricing and 29 basis points from the benefit of refunds and
changes in liquidity balances.
While deposit costs continued to increase, our earning asset beta of 49% is outpacing our total cost of deposit
and total cost of fund betas of 36% and 41%, respectively, cycle to-date. We continue to benefit from the shorter
tenor of our asset base, including the fact that 67% of our loan portfolio reprices within 12 months.
On a linked quarter basis, our loan yield beta of 61% outperformed our total deposit beta of 48% and total cost of
funds beta of 59% but were lower than our cost of interest-bearing deposit beta of 69%. As I noted earlier, the
beta on our cost of interest-bearing deposits increased due to mix shift, including our issuances of brokerage CDs
with different tenors prior to and subsequent to the failure of SVB. In the first quarter, approximately 38% of our
average deposits were interest-free DDAs, down slightly from 40% in the fourth quarter.
The flexibility embedded in our balance sheet from variable rate loans that reprice and a higher proportion of
DDAs provides us the ability to absorb and mitigate increases in cost of liabilities in the current high interest rate
environment. As we noted before, given the larger corporate and institutional nature of our deposit base, our
deposit betas are more pronounced than many of our peers.
In the current interest rate environment, we've taken additional steps, enhancing asset pricing discipline and
further emphasizing lending that has deposit relationships as well. As we look ahead, there are many factors that
play into our expectation for net interest margin, including the shape of the yield curve, anticipated changes to
short-term interest rates, continuation of mix shift, higher cash levels and competitive pressures from other
financial institution and off-balance-sheet products. There is a greater degree of uncertainty today given the
confluence of all these factors. Looking ahead, we would expect mid-single-digit growth in net interest income on
a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we expect to generate positive operating leverage in 2023.
Our reported noninterest income of $130.2 million contains the market-related variances, including in company-
owned life insurance income of $4 million versus just $21,000 in the fourth quarter and a $1.8 million increase in
customer-related derivative income. COLI income has a similar offset in deferred compensation expense.
Customer acquisition and solid performance in corporate trust, funds services and private wealth drove a 5.3%
increase in trust and securities processing income. Quarterly income in that category exceeded $62 million, and
we continue to see opportunities for growth. The $5 million decrease in net investment security gains relates to an
impairment in the value of one of our bank sub debt holdings.
The detailed drivers of our $237 million in noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release. A few
items of note. Employee benefits expense increased $13.2 million largely due to typical seasonal reset of payroll
taxes, insurance and 401(k) expense. As previously noted, the industry-wide increase and FDIC assessment fees
added $1.3 million. And we had a full quarter of increased amortization expense related to the HSA acquisition in
the fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we expect approximately $4.5 million of additional amortization
expense annually. These increases were offset by normalization of accruals related to various incentive plans and
timing of marketing and other spend from elevated fourth quarter levels.
Considering those variances, we would put our quarterly starting point closer to $227 million for noninterest
expenses. Despite positive trends in the credit metrics, provision for the first quarter increased to $23.3 million
and included approximately $9 million related to forecasted changes to key economic variables and $7 million for
growth in our loan portfolio. The quality of our loan portfolio remains excellent, as Mariner mentioned.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Our coverage ratio increased to 97 basis points of total loans from 91 basis points at year end. Our effective tax
rate was 17.2% for the first quarter compared to 15.7% in the first quarter of 2022. The increase rate was driven
primarily by excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation. For full year 2023, we anticipate the tax
rate will be approximately 17% to 19%.
Now, looking in more detail at the balance sheet, I'll start with the details on our investment portfolio slides 28 and
29. Our average investment security balances remained relatively flat from the fourth quarter at $11.6 billion,
excluding the $1.2 billion of industrial revenue bonds in the held-to-maturity category. During the quarter, $250
million of securities, with an average yield of 2.42% rolled off.
The yield on our AFS portfolio increased 15 basis points to 2.69%. And the HTM portfolio, excluding of the IRBs I
mentioned had an average yield of 2.36% for the first quarter, an increase of seven basis points. The portfolio is
split roughly 60/40 between available for sale and held to maturity. And the AFS book has a duration of four
years.
Additionally, the portfolio is expected to generate nearly $1.6 billion of cash flows in the next 12 months, providing
further funding flexibility. The roll off of these securities will also improve our AOCI position over that period. Our
unrealized loss position has improved from year end, benefiting from the reduced marks of AFS portfolio and
HTM portfolios as interest rates have come down since December 31.
As of March 31, the unrealized pre-tax loss on the AFS portfolio narrowed to $678 million or 8.9% of the
amortized cost. For the HTM portfolio, this loss was $490 million, relative to the amortized cost. As we've shared
previously, we transferred securities with an amortized cost of $4.1 billion from AFS to HTM in 2022. The
remaining balance of the unrealized pre-tax losses related to the transfer was $237 million as of March 31.
Additionally, an after-tax gain of $57 million related to fair value hedges was included in AOCI. We have no need
to sell bonds which could result in realized losses. We intend to hold these securities as they are important asset
class used to collateralize municipal and trust deposits and can be used to bolster our liquidity.
Slide 33 highlights our liquidity position, along with the contingent sources of funding available to meet customer
and operational need. As of March 31, we had $13.4 billion in available liquidity sources. As Mariner mentioned,
liquidity coverage of uninsured deposits had increased to 116% as of last week. Also, on that slide, we've
included our regulatory capital ratios. Our CET1 of 10.57% compares favorably to the peer median, our tangible
common equity ratio in percent. Excluding AOCI, TCE was 7.83%.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question, comes from Jared Shaw from Wells
Fargo. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
First, just good job during a difficult environment with the deposit balances. That's nice to see the resilience of the
model there. As we look at deposits, I think in the past, you've talked about DDA as a percentage of total maybe
troughing around 35%. Is that still a good sort of floor to expect on zero cost deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, this is Mariner. I mean, we watch it closely. We still expect to maintain the overall outsized balances. Who
knows exactly what the pressure on short term will be on higher interest rates? It's possible that a little bit could
move yet from where we are at 38% today. But we don't necessarily expect that. We just can't really tell you one
way or the other, if there's a little more movement because of the higher rate environment. Don't expect it to leave
the balance sheet, however.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, this is Ram, Jared. The only thing I would add is, last cycle we bottomed out at 32%. And since then, we
have a lot of new businesses like corporate trust on the aviation side that contribute a lot of DDAs as well. So,
arguably, you would assume that it would be higher than where we bottomed out last time. But as Mariner said,
this is unprecedented rate environment and rates are much higher than anybody ever foresaw that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
But I mean, it's been more stable than we've – it's been more stable than we would have expected it to be really,
given the higher rate environment. So, we don't expect a whole lot of movement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, as we look at the beta, sort of the cumulative beta through the cycle, what should we expect for a
peak through the cycle beta on overall cost of deposits or interest, however you want to look at it?

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we're 36%, as I said in my prepared comments. We're probably assuming another rate hike and we
stay at 5.25%. I would expect our total cost of beta to be around 40%, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And Jared, I would just add, we like to focus everybody on the whole balance sheet anyway. We expect our asset
pricing to remain strong and disciplined. And obviously, our asset base is very flexible. And with 60% of our loans,
repricing with interest rates and 70% within 12 months is really, really important from our perspective and not just
focus on deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe once we see rate cuts at some point in the future, how quickly can that pass through to margin? What type
of lag should we expect once we actually see cuts in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
This is such a different environment. I guess, it's hard to tell. I mean, if you look at past cycles, the deposits will
move faster on the way down, which is the opposite on the way up, right? So on the way down, historically, we've
benefited faster because the deposits move first on the way down.
So, if that's any – if the past is any indication of the future, we're positioned pretty well for that. It's probably too
early to talk about how prepared we are with the assets, on what term and what floors are and all that. I mean, it's
awfully early in the cycle to get movement on that, but we'll be prepared for you when it comes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. And then just finally, for me, I appreciate the color on the office space and the detail around how
high quality it is. As you're talking to sponsors better, maybe coming due in the next 18 months, is your sense that
– do those come to you they'd be – that there's access to additional equity to put into those deals? Has they come
to you to keep those strong metrics, or do you think that they're more willing to sell on properties at renewal now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No. I'll take a stab at that, and Tom can add to it. I mean, these are very, very strong borrowers with low loan to
values, stressed interest rates on the front end. And we do all our work on the front end. That's probably the best
answer I'd give you. We stress these upfront and to very, very strong liquid sponsors with big portfolios of other
real estate and strong cash flow coming off of other projects. I don't know, Tom, if you'd add anything. We're the
wrong bank. We focus on the office portfolio. It's less than 4.4%. It's super strong. We don't think about it over
here. But Tom, I don't know...

Yeah. This is Tom Terry. Just to reiterate, 4.5% of our total portfolio – and we are more suburban in terms of more
low- and medium-rise office as opposed to downtown office. And so, we have very strong sponsors, but we don't
have any worries about their ability to put in more equity if that's required at the time of renewal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And I think in our remarks, we talked about how much of it reprices in 2025 and beyond. When think about the
cycle and the changes in interest rates, I mean, we're probably pretty well protected anyway by the time 2025 rolls
around.

your line is now open.

Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just going back to credit, obviously, this earnings season have been a
lot about office, real estate. Mariner or team, is this where we need to focus for your company the most? Is there
other portfolios that perhaps are getting more attention?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Just a moment ago, as I tried to reference, we don't worry about our office at all here. Again, it's a very, very small
part of our portfolio. We don't worry about office here. And I don't – if you go to our provision expense, $9 million –
as we've mentioned in our comments, $9 million of that is tied to the CECL process that we now use with
economic factors. $7 million of it was based on loan growth.
We have zero expectation that we fall outside of our historic charge-offs metrics, regardless of what the
environment is. We've been at this a long time. In this room with me, I've got Jim Rine and Tom Terry. Three of us
have been doing this together through the last three cycles, and we've had outstanding credit metrics, so really
proud of them. We don't suspect anything different.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you for that. In terms of maybe a question on the ratings downgrade, which has gotten a lot of attention for
the group. Does this change your business at all? Are there deposits that either are tied or correlated to your
rating? Obviously, we could argue if it's backward-looking or even right to begin with. But is there any effect on
your deposits from what happened?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No, not long term. We had – there was a little disruption at the very beginning that Monday after SBV failed where
it cost us a little bit with a few clients, but since then, that's all recovered. I would point you to something pretty
important, which is when the interest rates go up nine times in a year and the expectation of the Fed is that we
slow the economy, guess what happens, we slow the economy. Banks are a big part of that. There's going to be a
contraction in loan growth for the industry. All of this is anticipated. All of it is expected. It's a cyclical outcome of
what the federal government is doing intended to slow the economy.
Was it exacerbated slightly by what happened to SVB? Sure. But we have way, way overblown the impact of two
to failed banks and expecting that, that had something to do with the rest of us. You guys on the phone are way
smarter than some of these market participants. You ask way better questions that are researched. And I would
just suggest that we move on and stop talking about the rating agencies which add no value.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes, thank you for that. That's good context. And then, maybe one for Ram, if I could. I think you said – I want to
be sure I got my notes, mid-single-digit growth in noninterest income, that's on a full-year 2023 over 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In terms of to get to that number, you mentioned $1.6 billion coming off the bond portfolio. I assume that'll get you
redirected into the loan book. Is the assumption still there, even with your slowing economy comments? I mean,
last quarter, you talked about double-digit grower regardless. Is that still kind of baked into that or did you have
temper that at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I might just re-ask, make sure I got your question right. Do we expect the same kind of loan growth? Is that the
question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Like what are the assumptions to get into that mid-single digit growth in NII. I assume it's the remixing of
the balance sheet a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Everything that you said, yeah, in terms of – I think we talked a little bit in our prepared comments about
how we're going to be really disciplined on asset pricing, making sure that our asset betas are exceeding what we
do on the deposit side, so whatever that means for the market. Mariner also talked in his prepared comments
about the expected contraction in just availability of credit.

Ram Shankar A

Our pipeline looks pretty good. So it's just no real softening of demand from what we see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think naturally loan growth will slow. That doesn't mean we stop growing. I just think that naturally,
system wide, loan growth will slow a little bit, but that's off a pretty decent growth base anyway. And you include
solid asset pricing, our ability, we believe we can continue to have strong loan data and strong pricing discipline.
Which coupled with, what we believe will be, a flattening of expansion on the deposit side, will allow that mid-
single digit expansion that Ram's talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Going back to the NII growth assumptions or guidance for 2023. Is that contemplating one more Fed rate hike in
May, and then have the Fed on pause from there? Was that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
That's right, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's correct, Nate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just in terms of some of the balance sheet dynamics of the quarter, looks like you had
about $2.8 billion in short-term debt. I guess, curious what the impetus behind that was and kind of what the near
term or intermediate term plans are for that, that was out of the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll take that. So if you look at our balance sheet, if you look at on the asset side, our interest-bearing
deposit at balance was also elevated at close to $3 billion, which was up to a $1 billion on a quarter-over-quarter
basis. So it's just out of abundance of caution that we had both sides of our balance sheet. We did have some
excess borrowings and they were parked at the Fed account. So, we're going to evaluate that periodically based
on the current climate and environment. But it's not a long term, obviously, strategy for us to be dependent on a
lot of wholesale funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We're watching it closely. Our expectation is that things continue to improve and normalize, and we reduce those
levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. So, I guess, under those kind of assumptions, is the expectation that you've got to generally fund
loan growth, which it sounds like the pipeline is still pretty strong, I mean, second quarter with both cash flow
commodities securities book and deposit growth as well going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we expect that we can continue to fund loan growth with deposits where we're re-centering, I think
as everybody is, around relationship banking, which is what we've always been. I think it's somewhat important to
note that, over the last decade you come off of the Great Recession, banks like us benefited pretty handsomely
from slight to safety, so our balances grew then.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
And then, you go into the pandemic and the government pumped money into the system and there was an
enormous amount of excess liquidity dumped into the system, which has been absorbed. And during that time, a
few banks like ourselves and many others, I think, started placing some high-quality loans on our balance sheet
that maybe didn't come with as much deep relationship in deposits.
And if there's anything we've reminded ourselves over the last 45 days, it's who we are, and what we've always
been which is a fantastic relationship-based bank with really deep relationships. And so, I think how we're going to
go forward with funding our loans is, we'll just be more re-centered around deeper relationships and that's how we
expect to fund loan growth going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, turning to some of fee income drivers in the quarter. It looks like you guys had a pretty
strong quarter when it comes to funds services, and the corporate trust and institutional segment. Is the rate of
growth that we saw in those lines self-sustainable as you look out over the next few quarters; or I guess, what are
some of the underlying kind of growth drivers that you guys are seeing in terms of new client adds and just overall
pipelines within those segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Nate, I think largely that a lot of it just coming from multiyear investments made in those businesses. So,
we talked actually in the last few quarters about what the pipeline looks in fund services, for example, based on
consolidation in the space and private equity-backed firms being sidelined for new business.
So, we've benefited a lot by some of that pipeline actually coming to fruition on the fund services side, for
example. And also, obviously, private equity has – because of what's happened to the public and liquid markets,
private equity has been really strong over the last many years and continues to be; and that's a strength for that
space.
All of our investments in corporate trust are paying off. We have that new office in Europe, in Dublin that allows us
to do business with 72 more states as it relates to airline business. If any of you have been in an airport recently,
you know that the travel business is on fire, and therefore, airlines are investing. And so, I just really kind of –
across the board, the investments we've been making over the past many years have paid off. We bought some
health care accounts from Old National. Our health care business is expanding, growing, broadening. It's just
really across the board.
I'll let Jim talk. You're probably going to say I said everything, but I'll...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Bank, NA (Investment Management)
Well, you did, but it's a combination of new client acquisition, but we've also had fees turned on. Mariner really did
cover it. But that business has been extremely steady and growing for us and the real contributor to our fee
income growth, and we don't see that slowing down for us any time soon.

And our credit card, we didn't mention this in the comments, but we saw a spend go over $4 billion for the first
time in the last quarter. That's in our debt. You can find that in there. So, it's really just kind of, I would suggest,
hitting on all cylinders.
And as far as our business model goes, you talked about the tightening of credit and the cycle that we're in right
now. What we've said forever is our fee income buoys us, and the diversity of our business model is what takes
us through economic cycles like this and allows us to outperform against our peers. And we don't expect that to
be any different this time.

And whereas other banks are more reliant upon their mortgage operations for their fee income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's just a friendly reminder. That's completely different.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. That latter point is not lost on me. If I could just ask one final one. Just going back to the office CRE portfolio.
Appreciate all the disclosures there. [Technical Difficulty] (00:38:19) across this portfolio to get to that average
LTV disclosed in the deck, and just generally how rent rolls are trending across that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'm not sure I've heard that totally well. Did you hear that, Tom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, if you're asking about loan to values, the thing to remember is, our average loan in the office portfolio is $8.2
million. When we underwrite out of the gate, we don't trend rents. And so we're underwriting these to a lower
sizing than a lot of our competitors do. And so, we – by virtue of how we underwrite on the front end, we do have
lower loan to values that I think some of our competitors would have.
And, again, back to the nature of our portfolio being more suburban, more low and moderate size versus a high-
rise-type product. We've not seen a lot of change in rental rates thus far. But again, a lot of our portfolio goes out
past 2025, 2026. So, we just haven't seen it yet, but today, they're performing as expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And our borrowers are all pretty large, diversified borrowers with big portfolios of other – that have cash flows and
have the demonstrated capability to resize and if they need to. But the real point about all this is how we do them

from the beginning, how we underwrite from the beginning, which is worst case – we underwrite from the
beginning with a worst-case scenario type of thinking. And it gives us a lot of room.
