Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on such a busy day. This morning,
our President and CEO, Bryan Jordan; and our Chief Operating Officer and Interim CFO, Anthony Restel, will
provide some prepared remarks. And then we'll be happy to take your questions. And we're pleased to have
Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit Officer, in the room with us today to assist with that effort.
So I need to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today that are subject to risks and
uncertainties, and we ask you to review the factors that may cause our results to differ from the expectations on
page 2 of our presentation and in our SEC filings. You can find our earnings materials on our website at
ir.fhnc.com.
Additionally, you need to be aware that our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of
notable items. These are non-GAAP measures. So it's really important for you to review the GAAP information in
our earnings release and on page 3 of our presentation. And last but not least, you need to understand that our
comments reflect our current views and that we are obligated to update them.
And with that, I'll hand things over to Bryan.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'm pleased with the continued
progress across our company this quarter and believe that our results demonstrate the benefit of our more
diversified model. Our attractive base, specialty businesses and higher growth markets are starting to drive our
performance.
We delivered EPS of $0.50 per share and a return on tangible common equity of over 18% on an adjusted basis
despite the near-term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short-term rates and
strong competition, given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand. Given the continued
improvement in the macroeconomic environment as markets reopen, I'm increasingly confident that our client-
focused value proposition with a broad product set positions us well to be nimble and focus on the key segments
where we can differentiate.
As a result, there were several bright spots in the quarter that I think are worthy of noting. Our net interest income
was down in the quarter, given expected reductions in net merger-related and PPP portfolio benefit. We
generated core net interest income growth of 1% with underlying loan growth of 1%, which was driven by a

commercial loan growth of 2%. We continue to see momentum in our commercial pipelines, and the quarter
ended with unfunded commitments up 5% to just over $19 billion.
Our team remains strongly focused on serving clients and anticipating their needs to continue to deepen
relationships across our expanded footprint. Our net interest-bearing deposits declined 3 basis points â€“
diminished by the cost decline 3 basis points in the quarter. The team is intensely focused on moving our cost
toward peer median, and we think we are well positioned to hit the target sometime next year.
And it's also important to note that we are well positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and ended the
quarter with an interest rate sensitivity profile of a 16% increase in the net interest income and a 100 basis point
shock across the yield curve. And while we expect the total fees to be down given the relatively healthy levels of
fixed income and mortgage banking fees last quarter, we also saw a return to more normalized levels in traditional
banking fees, which were up 2% in the quarter, with particular strength in wealth on strong annuity sales.
Credit quality continues to be excellent with improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio, highlighted by
net charge-offs of only 2 basis points and a 47% decrease in loan balances on deferral in the quarter. That,
coupled with the improving macroeconomic environment, drove another robust reserve release with a provision
credit of $85 million in the quarter. This was a 26% decrease in the provision benefit this quarter versus last
quarter. Given the impact of CECL, as we look ahead, provision expense will likely be a headwind for us and the
industry overall.
As our capital levels remain strong with a CET1 ratio of around 10.1%, we increased our capital return by nearly
60% in the quarter, repurchasing 9 million shares of common stock and ended the quarter with a tangible book
value per share of $10.88. And despite the difficult decision to delay the systems integration until February of next
year, we continue to execute on the objectives of the MOE, with strong progress on integrating systems and
aligning products and capabilities, including piloting the new digital platform for treasury services, launching new
relationship and banker profitability tools and completing the first round of banking center consolidation.
Given some higher costs tied to integration of our platforms, along with higher costs due to markets reopening,
much of which is marketing, as well as the seasonality and the idiosyncratic items in our expenses were up 3% in
the quarter. However, as Anthony will cover later, we expect expenses to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Alongside our integration efforts, we continue to invest in technology and people to drive revenue synergies and
expense efficiencies. And thus far, we've identified approximately $35 million in revenue synergies tied to the
merger. We remain confident in our ability to deliver at least $200 million in net annualized savings by the fourth
quarter of next year.
As we begin to look ahead into next year, I'm increasingly optimistic about the pace of the macroeconomic
recovery as the world emerges from the pandemic and that the power of our combined organization will continue
to be increasingly evident. I'm very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to
work to deliver value for all of our constituents, clients, communities and shareholders and help drive the
momentum to achieve our long-term performance objectives.
And now Anthony will run through the financial details. Anthony?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning to you, all. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the quarter, most of which Bryan has
already covered. Overall, we continue to make solid progress across the combined organization, and we're
pleased to see evidence of the power of the MOE starting to emerge.
I'll briefly touch on slide 7, where we outline the notable items in the quarter, which reduced our results by $51
million after-tax or $0.09 per share. In addition to merger-related notable items of $44 million, we recorded $23
million of noncash pre-tax costs tied to retiring legacy IBERIABANK trust preferred securities in the quarter and
expect to record an additional $3 million next quarter. The redemptions will reduce interest expense by about $5
million annually with an expected payback of approximately five years.
Slide 8 provides an overview of our adjusted financials for the quarter. We generated PPNR of $284 million as
underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of
expected declines in net merger-related and PPP net interest income, along with lower fixed income and
mortgage banking fees.
Adjusted expenses of $480 million moved higher, largely reflecting idiosyncratic items tied to strategic
investments and additional costs we incurred tied to markets reopening. Given continued improvement in the
macro environment, overall credit quality and muted loan growth, we posted a credit to provision of $85 million,
which was down from the $115 million credit last quarter. This reduction drove a $0.04 decline in EPS.
But overall, we continue to post healthy returns with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4% and
14% before the impact of the provision credit. As Bryan mentioned, tangible book value per share came in at
$10.88, up 1% as GAAP net income was largely offset by a $0.23 impact tied to the return of capital and a $0.07
decline tied to the mark-to-market on the security portfolio and OCI.
Moving to slide 9. Net interest income was down $5 million linked quarter, given the expected decrease tied to
lower merger, accretion and PPP portfolio balances. Core net interest income was up 1% as the benefit of lower
deposit costs, day count, commercial loan growth and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by
continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression, given the continued
reductions in LIBOR and the competitive landscape.
During the quarter, we ramped up our security purchases to put more excess cash to work and added around
$400 million on a spot basis at a yield of around 1.5%. As a result, our securities to interest-earning assets ended
the quarter at 11%, up 1%. Our current plan is to put a total of $1 billion of excess cash to work in securities by
year-end, and we will continue to reevaluate opportunities to redeploy additional cash as we move forward.
Reported NIM was down 7 basis points linked quarter with core NIM down 8 basis points, driven by a 5 basis
point impact tied to higher excess cash. We ended the quarter with excess cash of $14 billion, up from $12.7
billion in the second quarter. Core NIM was also lower, given a 2 basis point reduction in interest recoveries on
nonaccrual loans as well as overall spread tightening with new origination spreads down around 15 basis points
linked quarter, which collectively translated to about 3 basis points of pressure on the margin. We also generated
a 2 basis point benefit to the margin with further improvement in the deposit mix towards DDA and a decline in
interest-bearing deposits.
I would also note that this quarter, we added disclosure to the relationship of core net interest income to risk-
weighted assets to help illustrate the impact of NII, excluding the excess cash position. Under this view, you can
see that year-over-year, the metric is down about 10 basis points compared to the core margin, which is down
about 40 basis points.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
And on slide 10, let's cover the puts and takes on fees. Headline fees were down around 7% in the quarter. This
reflected anticipated declines in other noninterest income and fixed income and mortgage that were partially offset
by growth in brokerage, trust and insurance tied to higher annuity sales as well as higher service charges and
fees as an increase in transaction volume and higher leasing income tied to terminations helped to mitigate the
impact of a recent change in our NSF pricing structure.
Fixed income average daily revenue came in at $1.3 million compared with $1.4 million last quarter. Mortgage
banking and title fees were down $4 million, given continued spread tightening and our focus on driving more of
our originations on balance sheet. While overall originations were down 11% for the quarter, portfolio originations
were up 5%. The reduction in our other noninterest income was driven by an $11 million decrease in security
gains tied to a legacy IBKC investment in the second quarter.
With regard to service charges, we recently began aligning key features across the legacy institution's approach
to service charges with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the experience for our clients. The new program
was launched in late August at First Horizon with the remainder of the change occurring following the system
conversions in February for our IBERIABANK franchise. Over time, we expect the changes to reduce our overall
NSF overdraft fees in the range of $9 million to $10 million annually with changes going into production in August
for First Horizon and with the February conversion for the IBERIABANK clients.
Let's turn to slide 11 and review expense trends. Adjusted expenses totaled $480 million, up $15 million in the
quarter, largely because of seasonality and some idiosyncratic costs related to strategic investments and
additional costs related to markets reopening, which was slightly offset by $1 million tied to incremental merger
cost saves.
Personnel expenses decreased $4 million linked quarter with salaries and benefits stable as a $4 million FICA
credit helped mitigate the impact of day count, seasonally higher medical costs and labor supply constraints.
Incentives and commissions remain relatively stable as a $3 million increase from pandemic-related vacation
carryover, partially offset lower revenue base payouts in fixed income and mortgage. I should note that as we
continue to shift more of our mortgage originations on balance sheet, you will see a reduction in mortgage fee
income without a corresponding reduction in incentives.
Additionally, higher contractor costs tied to investments in new systems, largely in areas like treasury solutions
and business banking online as well as increased advertising spend, given our reopening of markets, pushed
outside services up $9 million.
And finally, other noninterest expense was up $11 million in the quarter, driven by higher tax credit-related
contributions, a $2 million increase in fraud cost and higher in travel and entertainment costs also for markets
reopening. We are focused on driving efficiencies and identifying opportunities to redeploy expenses toward
areas which provide higher growth for the organization, particularly post the systems conversions in February.
On slides 12 and 13, we cover our balance sheet profile, excluding PPP balances, which were now $1.8 billion in
the quarter. Average loans increased 1% in the quarter. And as Bryan mentioned, this reflected commercial
growth of 2%. Our pricing strategies in the mortgage warehouse business helped deliver a 7% increase in
balances with purchase volume up 3 percentage points linked quarter to 56%.
Additionally, we continue to see traction in other specialty businesses with a growth in asset-based lending,
equipment finance and franchise finance, somewhat offset by a reduction in commercial real estate, given the
6

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
higher levels of refinancing activity from the capital markets. This is being somewhat offset by a continued
pressure in retail, real estate-secured refinancings, which drove a 1% decline in consumer loans, but we're
reviewing opportunities to increase our recapture of these with refi opportunities. Overall, we are pleased to see
the path of the economic recovery, and the increased activity levels across our footprint translate to this level of
loan growth.
On the liability side, we saw a continued inflow of deposits, driven by a $1.1 billion average increase in DDA of
4%, which helped to further improve the mix of deposits. And with the interest-bearing deposit cost down 3 basis
points to 17 basis points for the quarter, our total funding costs improved 2 basis points. As Bryan mentioned, we
are intensely focused on driving our interest-bearing deposit costs down toward peer median levels.
On slide 14 and 15, we provide information on asset quality and reserves, where we continue to see exceptional
low levels of charge-offs and nonperforming loans, and our allowance coverage of loans is healthy at 1.45% and
1.65%, excluding loans from mortgage companies and the PPP portfolio. Additionally, when you consider the
unrecognized discount on acquired loans, our total loss absorption is roughly 2%, which is very strong.
Turning to capital on slide 16. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1%, down from 10.3% in the second quarter, tied to the
accelerated share repurchases in the quarter, loan growth, and higher unfunded commitments. As Bryan
mentioned, we returned $224 million in capital to common shareholders during the quarter, including $142 million
or 9 million shares of common stock repurchases.
Moving on to merger integration on slide 17. While we had to delay the core systems conversions to early next
year, we continue to make substantial progress across a number of fronts. During the quarter, we completed a
couple of mock conversion events and completed our wealth and trust and credit card conversions, finalized the
mortgage system conversion and launched the pilot of our new online banking platform for commercial
customers. We achieved $96 million in annualized run rate savings against our net target of $200 million.
Additionally, we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies and have thus far identified roughly $35
million of annualized revenue synergies that are tied to commercial loans and additional synergies tied to debt
capital markets, mortgage and private client wealth. We are extremely focused on retaining and growing our client
base by continuing to enhance or expand our set of products and services.
On slide 18, we provided our fourth quarter outlook. We expect NII to be down at the high end of the low-single-
digit range with average interest-earning assets and loans down modestly, given the outlook for reduced merger
accretion and PPP benefits and continued low rates. We expect to continue to see modest loan growth, excluding
PPP, and that we will see benefits as we continue to lower deposit cost. At period-end, we had a total of $2 billion
in PPP loans, including $600 million related to round one and total PPP fees of $45 million. We expect the vast
majority of the round one portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the year and that the round two will largely be
forgiven by the third quarter of next year.
Regarding noninterest income, we expect fee income to be down in the mid to high-single-digit range with
additional decreases tied to our NSF pricing changes and seasonally lower mortgage and wealth fees as well as
further moderation in fixed income. We expect noninterest expense to decrease in the low-single-digit range with
higher third quarter levels, which included investments, seasonality costs tied to markets reopening and some
idiosyncratic items, and our outlook calls for charge-offs to be in the range of 5 basis points to 15 basis points.
And that it's reasonable to see continued reserve outflows near term.

Finally, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain in the 9.5% to 10% range. As Bryan mentioned, we feel good about
our positioning and our ability to perform well, given the current economic environment.
Finally, slide 19 includes our short and long-term objectives. We believe our more diversified model and highly
attractive franchise will continue to deliver revenue synergies and loan growth. Our MOE objectives to complete
the systems integration and to identify other expenses to redeploy to higher growth and higher return
opportunities will allow us to continue to support the dynamic digital needs of our clients and associates and drive
continuous improvement in productivity and efficiency beyond the integration. And as we continue to actively
manage capital, our balance sheet and credit quality performance position us well to continue to deliver attractive
results near term and into the future.
And with that, I'll give the call back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Anthony. I'm excited about the momentum and the results of the combined organization, what we've
achieved this quarter. The power of our attractive franchise with the benefit of a more diversified business model
and higher growth markets is evident in our results. The progress we have made towards our merger integration
objectives continues to deliver revenue synergies to provide our clients with improved products and technology.
As the macroeconomic environment continues to improve, our capital structure and risk management
infrastructure positions us to deliver higher growth and top quartile returns into the future.
I am grateful again to our associates for their dedication towards building and strengthening client relationships
and supporting our communities. And I am confident in our ability to become a top-performing regional bank and
to drive enhanced shareholder value.
With that, Kate, we'll now open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just, Anthony, a point of clarification on the NII guide. The high end of
the low-single digits, does that mean 3% or 1%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
3%, Casey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. Okay. And on the expense side, the reopening costs continue to tick up and are kind of chewing
into the cost saves. I know there wasn't a lot of progress there this quarter. But just curious, as you look forward,
are the reopening costs kind of fully in there? Or is there more potential headwind there that could mute the cost
saves that you have remaining?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No. I think the reopening costs are largely â€“ are kind of in the numbers now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. Okay. And then just lastly on the fee side, the NSF fee policy change and the fixed income is â€“
or you mentioned as potential drags. Where do you â€“ can you give us some color on where ADRs you expect to
trend this quarter? And then where can the service charges line run rate in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Casey, this is Bryan. The fixed income business is inherently unpredictable. We still feel good about the
environment. There's still a tremendous amount of excess liquidity across the financial system and bond activity
continues to be good. Our forecast for the year is $1.5 million average daily revenue, and we expect that we'll fall
in that range for the full year. So that implies a little lower level than in the fourth quarter, but we still expect to be
in that $1.5 million in average daily revenue.
On the NSF fees, we have done some â€“ made some changes to, one, reflect our desire to be more customer
friendly, which has some impact on it. And then the fact that the liquidity is so strong, it has driven down the
NSF/OD, service charge fees, et cetera, in this environment. The changes we made on an annual basis amount
to about $8 million on an annual basis. So it's a â€“ on a quarterly basis, it'll be rather insignificant. But we think it
will be better for customer acquisition, retention and growth over the long term.

Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. And then, Casey, one, just to add, just since I know this somewhat turns into a modeling for you. That
number, that Bryan mentioned, on the annual impact is not an equivalent number every quarter, right? So just
recognize that typically early in the year, a lot of our consumer customers benefit from tax refunds, et cetera,
which kind of keep the number deflated in the early part of the year. And then, typically, it accelerates through the
year. So just know that it's not a flat number every quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just one more, the deposit growth obviously continues to be very strong. You've got the cash
position increased again this quarter. What is the â€“ do you expect that to continue, the liquidity strength? And then
what is a normalized cash position for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I do think that the cash, unfortunately, probably continues to build. Just recognize as we continue through
the PPP forgiveness process, that we end up receiving cash from that as we kind of go through that exercise. So
we do have cash will likely continue to be very strong for us. What I'll tell you is we probably have, I don't know,
Bryan, maybe $10 billion to $12 billion of excess cash relative to what we would typically hold in a kind of more
normalized-type environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And I'll remind you, although it's painful and we always spend a lot of time talking about what we're going to do to
use the cash or dispose of the cash, just recognize that cash is coming in it's something lower than â€“ slightly
lower than what we earn on the cash. And so although it's painful, just recognize that we're earning 15 basis
points. And in a lot of cases, yes, it is inflating the balance sheet. But when you look at the growth during the
quarter, we're really not paying anything for that. So although I don't like it because it creates a lot of noise for us,
I don't mind the concept of picking up a lot of nickels along the way to generate some income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The other thing that it does too, Anthony, is it adds deposit lag when it then starts to increase, right? It gives a
tremendous amount of liquidity. And I think, across the board for the industry, you'll see more deposit lag than has
been historically modeled simply because of that level of liquidity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Morning, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So if I look at loan growth for the quarter, ex PPP and ex the warehouse, I think loan growth was about 3% linked
quarter annualized. And I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on doing an amount of loan growth better
than that. I mean we've seen â€“ especially this quarter, we've seen some of your peers really start to inflect.
Synovus like, for example, grew 10% linked quarter annualized this quarter. I know Pinnacle was even over that.
So some of your peers are putting up notably higher loan growth as we're coming out of COVID. So just
wondering if you guys could comment on the idea of better loan growth beyond just the 3% level you saw this
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I'll start, Brady, and then I'll ask Susan to add any color, if she likes. She's very, very close to this. This is
an interesting environment. And the demand for loan growth is not extraordinarily high even with the recovery. We
see the markets being very, very competitive. And if I had to characterize the markets that say that they're
becoming very competitive on price, on structure and on term, and we're being selective.
One of the things that we have emphasized and we highlighted in our comments a couple of different ways this
morning is we want to protect the integrity of the balance sheet and want to protect credit quality. So we're being
very thoughtful about price structure and term with an eye towards long-term credit quality.
That said, we see real opportunity in our customer base. We're seeing real strong momentum across our
franchise. Our pipelines have continued to strengthen. We have highlighted on this call that our commitments
were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter, which is in my view spring-loading the balance sheet for future growth.
And so I'm optimistic about our ability to grow loans and to protect credit quality. We don't get fixated on setting a
number that we've got to go out and hit.
We've focused on, one, acquiring good bankers, having our bankers focus on their customers and the
communities and picking up the opportunities and being competitive that exist in the marketplace. I'm not close
enough to other's results to have a sense of what drove their growth, but I'm encouraged about our ability to grow
loans in a quality fashion.

Susan, anything you want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. We are seeing good momentum in pipeline. Also as was mentioned earlier, the revenue synergies from the
combined organization are really, really starting to show up with referrals into asset-based lending, equipment
finance. Both of those areas had good increases quarter-over-quarter.
And if you look at pipeline, there's additional pipeline for revenue synergies. In addition to those specialty
businesses, we're seeing strength in our markets which, as you know, are very, very good, strong growth
markets. So Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Middle Tennessee, et cetera. We're in some of the best
markets in the southeast in Texas.
In addition to that market, as good markets, we've had good success continuing to hire both relationship
managers and market leaders in some of those markets that are very, very important to us from a high-growth
perspective. In addition to new to bank type relationships that we're getting both from existing bankers as well as
some of these folks that we're bringing over, these strong producers, we're also selectively taking higher hold
limits with our existing clients as a result of our larger balance sheet. So we're very optimistic about the future. But
as Bryan said, we will remain prudent and be selective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then my second question is on just deploying the cash into the bond book over time. And I hear you,
you're going to do another $1 billion by the end of the year. But as Anthony said, you have $10 billion to $12
billion of excess cash, which sounds like it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The long end of the curve is
starting to rise here. I mean, as we look into 2022, should we think about more cash being pushed into the bond
book over time, kind of similar to what you all have done on the back half of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Brady. So just a point of clarification, right? So we announced putting $1 billion in, in the last quarterly
conference call. We've got about $400 or so million of that done in the third quarter, so we've got a little bit, $600
million, I'll call it, tailpiece of it we expect to get done by the end of the year. Look, the good news is rates are
moving up. But I'll tell you, I think we're going to kind of roll through the end of the year and then reevaluate kind
of where we think we are relative to where the economy is at and what makes sense for us, right?
So as you know, right, the expectation for an increase in federal funds continues to creep forward. And so I think
we're going to â€“ as opposed to telling you what we're definitely going to do now, what I would tell you is we're
going to evaluate it relative to what makes the most sense for us. But I think it's probably prudent here to wait and
see what kind of evolves over the next two to three months before we make that call. So it's a good question for
the January conference call.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start â€“ so, Bryan, on the 5% increase in commitments you're calling out, was that from existing
customers or new customers? And then when you say that competition is high on price structure and term, is that
from peer regional banks, larger banks? Maybe give some color there, too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The last part is yes, it's across the board. The competition starts with smaller institutions all the way up through
some of the bigger players, and it's really trying to show growth in a period where loan demand is not as strong as
you might expect. It's reasonably intuitive, I suppose, given the amount of excess liquidity that sits in the system.
We talk about the excess liquidity on our balance sheet. That's customers' money. So that means that they don't
need to borrow as much.
The 5% commitment is a combination of things. A lot of it is construction lending. One of the variables that we and
everybody else is dealing with, I suppose, is in just the sheer amount of payoffs. Our commercial real estate
business, for example, had very strong originations in the second and the third quarter, but payoffs were actually
greater. There's an end to that.
And so when we book a new loan in commercial real estate, that loan will fund up. That flows into those numbers.
So it's a mixture of existing customers. It's a mixture of new customers. We've got a very nice blend. We're seeing
good momentum across the franchise in our higher growth markets and some of our more stable markets. One of
13

the ones that's done extremely well over the last several quarters is Alabama, for example. We're seeing great
growth opportunities there and acquiring new customer relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's actually very helpful. I wanted to shift gears and follow up on the $8 million annual impact from the
NSF pricing change, which is actually fairly minimal. How much revenue would you have ultimately given up if you
just eliminated the $15 transfer fee also?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I'll tell you what, let us see if we can â€“ we don't have that right in front of us. Let us see if we can dig that up
during the call. And if we can get it, we'll come back before we get off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A

It will be more than $8 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
More than $8 million. Okay. Maybe helpful to see that number. And maybe, Bryan, just final a big picture question.
So looking at the list of items on slide 17 regarding the merger integration, there's still quite a bit of wood to chop,
right, particularly with the system conversion being delayed a bit. When do you see the company moving more
fully back on offense, right? Let's focus on retaining staff, more focus on recruiting staff. Is this a mid-2022 event?
And is that the point where we'll start to see the growth that this new company is capable of delivering? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So first, on the deferral of the integration event, we passed the Columbus Day weekend. And like
everybody else, we had hoped that we would have it done then. As I reflect back on the decision that we were
making in the midst of Ida and being forced to drop customer notifications, et cetera, on the Monday following out
Ida hitting New Orleans on Sunday, I feel good about that decision.
I think seeing the devastation there, the difficulty in recovery in the market and the impact on our associates and
our ability to train and deploy technology, et cetera, and then the impact on our customers, I think that was a good
move. We will get that integration completed in February. I have a high degree of confidence, and we'll make
good use of the time. We've talked about the impact on one time, as we've talked about the impact on delay in
cost savings.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
I would say that you will start to see the significant benefits of the integration starting in the last part of the first
quarter and clearly picking up on the cost savings side in the second quarter of 2022. I think, as we sort of alluded
to in a number of different ways, we're starting to see the benefit of the revenue side of it today. We've mentioned
the $35 million in revenue. And we've talked about the acquisition of customers in the franchise. So I would tell
you that our markets, that our bankers are very much front-footed.
They're looking to bring talented bankers on to the platform. Susan mentioned that we've hired a new president,
for example, in Dallas, has come on to our platform into the organization. We're hiring bankers. So I think we're
very much front-footed, and I think you will see that momentum start to build over the next couple of quarters and
into 2022.

Anthony J. Restel A

Hey, Steve. Following up on your question, right? If you look at kind of the kind of run rate where we are, if you
adjust for that $8 million number, we're around $45 million in remaining NSF fees on an annual basis. Now keep
in mind, that's relative to transaction volumes and all today, so that could all change. That would be the current
kind of run rate.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just one clarification on the earlier expense question. Anthony, I think you're saying that Q4 expenses probably
dropped back down to the levels we saw in Q1 and Q2. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. The expenses will pull back.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. And some of the other items, that's what you're talking about that will come out. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Look, we had some items that don't reach the definition of kind of, I'll call it, a one time. But from our view,
that we don't expect them to repeat. And so those will certainly roll down a little bit. And then, clearly, as we
expect to see some moderation within that fee income, there are several incentive kind of structures tied to those
fees. And so that will also roll down. That's what gives us the confidence that we'll see the decline in the expenses
in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, this is Bryan. We hadn't been spending much on marketing. We increased our marketing spend in the
quarter as one of the things that we called out. I mentioned that we were piloting a new treasury services platform.
We haven't taken out the old treasury services platform on either side, but we're now depreciating the new one as
well. So there's a little bit of redundancy that has sort of gotten built up. That's what drove a lot of the surge in the
third quarter.
I would hang my hat on the fact that we have demonstrated in the past that we have the ability to control and take
cost out of the organization and that we're focused on that, and I'm confident. And I think I said in my opening
comments, at least $200 million in cost savings, I feel good about our ability to reduce the cost of doing business.
And I would look at this as sort of a one-time aberrational trend. And as Anthony said, you'll start to see expenses
coming down later this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you've been great on expenses. Maybe for Susan and/or Bryan, thoughts on where the
reserve could go longer term. It still seems a little bit elevated relative to your credit quality, and I just want to
square that, Bryan, with some of your prepared comments saying that provision expense is likely to be a
headwind for you and for the industry. Help us figure out exactly what you mean on that. Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I'll start. Jon, we are â€“ assuming that the economy continues to emerge from COVID, which obviously it is
doing that now, and after any other events, we believe that we could see coverage get back down to kind of the
CECL day one coverage in the $115 million range or so. So that's kind of what we're thinking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. And my comments about the headwind, we highlighted we had a reserve release. I think it was $110
million. And while $885 million is great, this quarter is less than it was last quarter, and reserve releases will
continue down. Inherent in CECL, every dollar of loan growth requires that you're actually booking reserves. So to
the extent we brought it down $85 million further loan growth we booked, we ended up at a 1.65% ex PPP, et
cetera.
We were setting up reserve. We're just sort of acknowledging that reserve releases over time will diminish. And
that as we get into a point where we get to this $115 million pre-CECL day one area, pre-pandemic area, that
those reserves under CECL bill, when you book a loan, you essentially book the life of loan losses. So you front
end the credit cost on it. And it's just going to be a headwind for us and the industry is all we're trying to highlight.

Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to the fixed income business. As
we get into a rising rate environment, I think if I look back to the way the business performed last cycle, there was
some pressure on ADR as you guys did the coastal securities during that period as well, which helped to soften
the decline. But can you just remind us how in a rising rate environment the ADRs would trend, assuming we get
there sometime later next year into 2023? Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Thanks, Michael. This is Bryan. The fixed income business is going to be affected by really the shape of
the yield curve more in this cycle, I think, than rising rates. A couple of thoughts on our expectations. One, we still
have a reasonably steep yield curve. And the longer term of the curve â€“ the longer end of the curve has been
moving up. And with the significant liquidity that exists and the financial system and the continued level of
prepayments, it's actually been good for the bond business even in a rising rate environment.
So our expectation is that the Fed will continue to reduce purchases or start to reduce purchases. They continue
to sort of telegraph that they're going to do it later this year. Start to reduce purchases under the quantitative
easing program. That will diminish over the course of the first half of 2022. That will steepen the yield curve a bit.
The long-term expectations will come up. But we think there's a tremendous amount of liquidity, and then that will
drive a significant fixed income revenue. If you get a significant move in the short portion of the curve, that would
be less attractive for the business.
But we've got a significant offset in the extreme interest sensitivity or, I'll say, a very strong interest sensitivity â€“
interest rate sensitivity that we have to the rising short-term rates, where the vast majority of our balance sheet is.
So we don't expect a significant spike in the short term rates. We do expect that the Fed will start moving up
either late next year or early 2023, but the bond business will continue to be good because you've got a relatively
steep curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great color. And back a couple of years ago during that cycle, the guidance for ADRs was kind of in the $1
million to $1.5 million a day range. Any reason to think that it would be different this go-round, just broad strokes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I'd tell you what, I'm not going to â€“ you might talk Anthony into putting that range out there again. He and I missed
that one for so many quarters that we had to say we were wrong. And I think as I look into 2022, I don't think that
there's something in that $1 million, call it, $1.1 million to $1.3 million range is a bad range. But I don't know what I
don't know about interest rates, and it's a business that we trade every single day. We deliver bonds to our
customers. We buy bonds from our customers, and the shape of the yield curve will impact it. So while we can
have the expectation today, we don't know what the rates really look like. We just have to position for them.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great, thanks. Just in terms of the expenses, I'm thinking of that $200 million of cost savings related to
the deal. Is there going to be a meaningful step-down in expenses when the system conversion happens in
February of next year? I mean would we notice it from our end? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Ken, it's Anthony. I think you're going to see just because the conversion is kind of towards the tail end of
February, that the more likely scenario is you'll really see the significant move in the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And with â€“ sorry, would second quarter actually be like absolute dollars lower or just lack of growth? I'm
just trying to gauge the magnitude of what we're talking about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No, no, no. We should see a significant step-down as we kind of move between the second and third quarters, not
just that we're not growing, the expenses should start to decline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I see. All right, perfect. And then just a clarification question. In the guidance slide, you mentioned that you expect
modest loan growth ex PPP in fourth quarter. I know this quarter, you had â€“ I think it was like up 1% ex PPP on a
core basis. When you say modest, are you talking sort of a similar 1%? Or what number are you sort of thinking of
there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So I think we're looking at total loans ex PPP, something around that 1%-ish. It will up. So that's a good
range to kind of think about.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Bryan, question for you on M&A. We've seen a lot of deals this year. I'm wondering where you think First Horizon
stands after the merger integration next year and what are your thoughts on future M&A for First Horizon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. There have been quite a few number of transactions. I don't know how the world changes. But as we sit here
today, my expectation is that we've got so many tremendous growth opportunities in places to deploy capital
across our franchise post this integration. That merger and acquisition is not really a priority for us. There are a
couple of dimensions that go into that. I think when we get this integration while we will have eliminated the vast
majority of any technology deficits that have existed.
We still believe that the goalposts continue to move on technology, and we have a number of things that we think
we'll continue to invest in feature functionality that will be better for our customers and add to our growth rate. We
feel strongly about our ability to capitalize on being in 15 of the top 20 MSAs in the South and really the
opportunity to leverage the relatively small or new presence that we have in many of those markets.
And finally, the other thing that's a practical consideration is we're in round numbers in $89 billion, $90 billion
balance sheet. You don't just sort of stumble across $100 billion threshold. So in our view, we want to focus on
organic growth, growing our customer base and taking advantage of these markets. And we think that coming out
of this integration, we'll be uniquely positioned to demonstrate the power of this franchise. So that's a long way of
saying M&A is not a priority and, in our view, is not the next logical step. We don't believe you can win a spending
game when it comes to technology. Scale matters, but it's not the only thing that matters. And we want to execute
and demonstrate the power of this footprint and this franchise.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I guess a couple â€“ one follow-up on the ACL. When you talk about the â€“
approaching the day one level, the 115 basis points, is that something you think â€“ like should we be thinking
about by the end of 2022 we could get there? Or is that something that with the improving economy, we could get
there faster than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Absolutely. As you've mentioned, there are a number of factors. I think the economy continues to improve, and
there is not another variant or something else that hints it's possible it could be midyear next year. As Bryan said
earlier, some of it just depends on other things that we can't predict at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then taking that extra time for the systems conversion, has that allowed you to find any incremental
opportunities to emphasize or expand technology and digital offerings that weren't initially considered?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So we have not really significantly changed our scope of what we plan to deliver for the conversion. We've
taken the extra time really to run through additional mocks, and dress rehearsals will be in place just to make sure
that the client experiences what we want. Certainly, around the edges, there's been a few, I'll call it, client
experience opportunities, which we enhanced. But for the most part, we haven't really changed the scope of what
we intended to do from a conversion perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And coupled with the decline in Delta variant at the time gives more opportunity to do training on systems and get
our people better prepared than they might otherwise have been.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just finally for me, how are spreads on the new loan production this quarter? And do you think that
we're at a bottom yet on incremental loan yields?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Look, spreads came in about 15 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter. I always like to say there's a limit
to how low they can go. So I think as we think about the core NII, right, we see some stability within that kind of
number. But I'll call it â€“ and we have modeled in, in terms of going forward, our expectations for some continued
level of spread compression.

I guess just first question as a follow-up, Bryan, and you've touched on this on some of the responses. But I think
when you talk to longer-term holders, I think there's some frustration around just when do we see the power of the
franchise. And is it fair from the outside â€“ I think Anthony talked about by the end of 1Q 2022, everything starts
coming together. Should we look at 2022 in terms of ROTCE, loan growth, revenue growth as the year where you
should be outperforming your peers and kind of delivering on all the great things we've expected post the deal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, Ebrahim, this is Bryan. I think 2022, you will start to see the power of the franchise. I think you're
actually seeing it's masked a little bit by some of the transition and some of the fee-oriented businesses. But the
loan growth, pipelines and what we're seeing across the franchise, we're starting to see emerging signs of it. And
we feel very strongly that by this time next year, you will see the strength of our ability to grow this franchise,
given our expectations for the macroeconomic environment, the interest rate environment for 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. And then one other thing, Ebrahim, just to point out. I mean I realize everybody probably knows us, but as
we head into all the various conversions that we're doing, whether it's card conversion, whether we're putting
people on TM products, right, we do go into some â€“ I'll call it, some close-out periods where we're not selling
legacy IBERIABANK clients into a new product to then have them onboard and then have to convert them, right?

So just recognize that there are some natural things that limit our ability to do some sales as we kind of move up
to the conversion point.
And so all of those, I'll call it, safety nets kind of come off relative to the client experience in terms of making sure
we don't have to move them twice. And so I think with all of that stuff kind of out of the way, I think you'll start to
see some of the incremental kind of push, not only on the loan sales, but really across the other fee categories
and the cross-selling efforts that we know are going to be pretty strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just a separate question, and apologize if you addressed this. I think in September, you
announced a partnership with Wipro on the VirtualBank cloud infrastructure. Just talked â€“ I don't think that's a
same provider for the bank. Just give us a sense of what's the play with VirtualBank. Is there a bigger sort of
strategic sort of plan in terms of breaking it out at some point and what virtual does on both lending and deposit
side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, look, we're â€“ so you kind of hit, Ebrahim, I'll call it, a couple of different things. And I'll tell you, we're
very excited about the VirtualBank. We were the first bank actually to convert off of a legacy system on to that
kind of new fintech core in the cloud environment, and we continue to build out that. The reception to the kind of
the product and the offering has been really good.
We haven't quite unveiled to the masses yet, I'll call it, the strategy that we're really going to employ. You should
expect that we'll continue to build out product functionality capabilities within the VirtualBank and that we'll have a
distinct marketing effort in kind of how we're going to brand it and drive it going forward. You'll see that in the next,
call it, three to six months where it'll become more apparent to you.
But for the near term, right, our intent is to grow it to where it can support itself and kind of really help us drive, not
only revenue, but learning and experiences in terms of seeing what takeaways we can bring back to the bigger,
larger bank. It will be part of First Horizon for the foreseeable future. So there's no intent right now to do
something different other than grow it, learn from it, make profit from it. And then longer term, we'll see what
happens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just, Anthony, you spent a lot of time during the last year around the integration looking at fintech
vendors. As you come out of the conversion, talk to us about the top one, two, three things that the bank needs to
do from a system and technology upgrade perspective that, I'm assuming, will be a multiyear process. And,
Bryan, if you want to jump in.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Yeah. Look, I'll tell you that I think the biggest thing as we kind of move â€“ so Bryan talked about really that we've
really closed most of the technology deficits and gaps that we wanted to get closed as we were kind of leading up
to it. So I would say, as a starting spot, I think that we're in a pretty good position technology-wise related to, call
it, peers. Still have some work to do around the edges on a few things that we need to do some upgrades on.
But I think what really matters to us as we move forward is really about leaning in on those things that can drive
significant improvement in either our efficiencies or our deliveries. So the credit process is one that that really kind
of stands out. And so obviously, we've installed nCino. And then with that, whether it's front-end side of that or
back-end side of what we're going to do there, I think is it can be pretty powerful. So expect we'll hear more about
how we've kind of taken and gone further with that whole nCino upgrade to really drive a complete improvement.
The second thing is the treasury management platform. We've had â€“ both companies have made a strategic
priority to invest and recognize growth in the TM space. That should continue. We've started on that journey. We
made significant investment. I will tell you that I'm very proud. And I think the TM system that we'll have will put us
in the kind of top echelon of available TM systems once we're kind of through all of our pilots and all. And so you
should expect to hear us to continue to really lean into that with more investment and more development. And
then, of course, with that, you should expect to get some nice growth out of that.
So those are probably the two big that kind of land relative to the, I'll call it, driving revenue. And that you would
see, on the back side, we've put in some new performance management type tools to help our regional presidents
and bankers fully understand the profitability and depth of their books, which should help us not only improve
overall profitability just from clarity, but really point out cross-sell opportunities, et cetera. So those â€“ if I had to put
three kind of items on the table, I'll tell you those are probably the big three that are going to have the most impact
for next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I would add, Ebrahim, I think Anthony and Randy Bryan have done a fantastic job building the core for us to focus
on driving our technology and improving technology over the long term. One of the things I'm really excited about
with Anthony putting on a new hat later this year to run our regional banking franchise is him and his process
technology-orientation being much closer to the customer and understanding customer needs and competitive
landscape. We've got a great push capability. I think Anthony leading our regional bank and working with our
bankers will create more pull for technology. So I think we'll be better end-to-end as a result of the infrastructure
that's been built and having somebody with Anthony's vision to help us get better with that and in customer-facing
sense all the time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. And then, Ebrahim, I apologize, you asked me about Wipro. I just want to tell you that we use Wipro for a
number of things, integration of systems, but a big healthy dose of helping us testing of what we're doing to make
sure we're getting it right before we deploy stuff. They've been a fabulous partner for us. And so I just want to give
you some context. So they'll be around helping us on a lot of different things through the upcoming years, but
they've been a fabulous partner for us.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Operator: The next question is from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Susan, I wanted to ask about the modestly lower unfunded commitment reserves when the C&I
commitments went up. Is that purely related to credit trends that you outlined earlier? And would we see that
reserve slip further?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I mean we just â€“ when you look at just the economic environment as well as our own asset quality, those
were the main drivers, both for unfunded commitment and funded.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So it's the same trend even though the commitments have gone up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And then, Anthony, back to the service charge commentary. Have you seen visibility on behavior changes
that lead to transaction volumes? Or is it more just seasonal activity that you were citing earlier?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
What I'll tell you, Chris, and I'm sure you can appreciate this, right? Customer behavior dynamics have shifted
post-COVID. And so certainly, that has an impact to us. And then there's just a tremendous amount of liquidity,
right? If you think about our excess cash, that all sits in not only our commercial customers, but a lot of our
consumers have more. So overall, NSF fees, right, in terms of a historical pattern will probably break from any
historical kind of precedent. And so it's probably too early for me to tell you exactly where things are going to go.
The number I gave you was kind of the current run rate adjusted for that. So I'm trying to give you the best info I
got. But I'll be the first to tell you that transaction volumes are starting to reemerge. I think we said transaction
volumes were up about 10%. And so we kind of have to see where things go, just it's a different world. And so it's
a little bit hard to look at historical numbers to give you a real sense that that's going to be the trend going
forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No. I understand and I appreciate the background. Thanks very much.

Operator: The next question is from Brett Rabatin of Hovde Group. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to make sure I understood the guidance around NII in the fourth quarter, the high
single digit or high end of the low-single-digit decrease which assumes lower accretion in PPP with relatively
stable core NII. Can you maybe break that apart a little bit in terms of the core NII versus the linked quarter
change in accretion in PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So Brett, our core NII was up about $4 million linked quarter. So when you say break it this quarter, so are you
talking about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Well, for the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Right. So I'd say, I think we believe that the core NII and margin have relatively bottomed this quarter, but we're
going to continue to see some headwinds from merger accretions come in. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And lower PPP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And lower PPP. So overall, we think of low single digits as being 1% to 3%. So we're saying, it can be down that
level, but we could see a continued probably modest performance in core.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then you were talking earlier, I'm curious, about the CFO position and if you think you might make
some announcement this year or if that might drag out into 2022.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Yeah. So first, I would say, I really appreciate what Anthony is doing. He's wearing a number of hats and doing a
fantastic job with that. So I'm grateful for what he's doing. I think we're making a good progress. Anthony and
really our entire leadership team have been engaged. We've seen a number of good internal and external
candidates, and we think that that we are making very good progress. And if I had to guess this year or next, I
think we will get to a conclusion this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then maybe one last one. In your prepared comments, you were talking about the revenue synergies,
$35 million. I want to make sure that I was clear. Would that be fee income? Or would that be more product sets
on the lending side for the IBERIA franchise?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony J. Restel A
Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
It's a little bit of both, right? So we've got â€“ we've had some expansion of, I'll call it, credit to put use in the larger
balance sheet to kind of provide larger credit to some of our existing clients. Also, our leasing products effectively
show up as kind of loan balances as well. At the same time, right, we've been able to cross-sell some wealth and
we've captured some international fees as well as some debt capital market fees. So it's really a combination. If
you ask me to kind of weigh it in my head, I'll tell you the predominance would show up as loan balances in that
number that I gave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
It's pretty impressive to me, Brett, when I look at where the synergies are coming from. If we've got something like
$10 million to $15 million of the incremental synergy revenue is coming just from referrals between our equipment
finance, equipment leasing business and the old First Horizon franchise and then referrals in the ABL business
from the old IBERIABANK franchise. And those are opportunities that we wouldn't otherwise have gotten.
We've got the other benefits of larger balance sheet. But just the product synergies, the mortgage product, I think
will be a huge win as we go forward. Private client wealth management is starting to build in a significant way. I'm
very optimistic about our ability, and we've talked a lot about the product set. But I think the bigger franchise and
footprint that we can spread this combined product set around will drive, I think, a lot of revenue as we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The only thing I would add too is that there's a lot of excitement about our relationship managers at both legacy
banks because of the expanded products, that being able to now offer, as an example, the equipment leasing,
equipment finance when we might have had to refer that outside the company. So there's a lot of excitement
around that, and we are seeing pipeline growth as a result of that expanded offering from both companies coming
together.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's great color. Appreciate that.
