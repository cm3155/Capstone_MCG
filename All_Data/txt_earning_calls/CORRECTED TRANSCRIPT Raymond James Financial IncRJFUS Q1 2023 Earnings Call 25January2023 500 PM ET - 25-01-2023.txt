Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Although there is a lot of disappointment for us in the Bucks
playoff game and even more disappointment for me is Paul Shoukry's Bulldogs won the National Championship,
Raymond James came through again with another good solid performance.
During a volatile and challenging market environment, we generated strong quarterly results, including record net
income available to common shareholders of $507 million, annualized return on common equity of 21.3%, and
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 26.1%. Once again, these results highlight the value of
having diverse and complementary businesses. Record Private Client Group results driven by robust organic

growth, along with strong expansion of net interest margins in the Bank segment and yields on the RJBDP
balances at third-party banks in the PCG segment, offset market-driven declines experienced through the capital
markets businesses.
As demonstrated this quarter, with the sharp increase in net interest income and RJBDP fees, we have been and
remain well-positioned for continued rise in short-term interest rates with diverse and ample funding sources, a
high concentration of floating rate assets and strong balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios.
Turning now to the results starting on slide 4. In the first fiscal quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.79
billion, record pre-tax income of $652 million and record net income available to common shareholders of $507
million, or $2.30 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions and the favorable impact of a $32
million insurance settlement received during the quarter, adjusted net income available to common shareholders
was $505 million, or $2.29 per diluted share.
Quarterly net revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter, and down 2% compared to the preceding
quarter, largely driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees
from third-party banks, offset by the market-driven declines in investment banking revenues and asset
management and related administrative fees.
Record quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 14% over the prior year's fiscal first
quarter largely due to higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. And as I mentioned
earlier, we generated very strong returns, with annualized return on common equity of 21.3% and annualized
adjusted return on tangible common equity of 26.1%, impressive results, especially given the challenging market
conditions and our strong capital position.
Moving on to slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.17 trillion, PCG
assets in fee-based accounts of $633 billion, and financial assets under management of $186 billion. With our
unwavering focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently
generates strong organic growth. We ended the quarter with nearly 8,700 financial advisers, and generated
domestic net new assets of $23 billion in the quarter, representing a 9.8% annualized growth rate on beginning of
the period domestic PCG assets.
Net new assets were strong this quarter, and also helped by the seasonally high interest and dividends received
in December. Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated net new asset growth of 7.3% of domestic PCG
assets at the beginning of the period. During the same 12-month period, we recruited, to our domestic
independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with nearly $300 million of trailing 12-month
production, and approximately $40 billion of client assets at their previous firms.
Total clients' domestic cash sweep balance has declined 10% to $60 billion, representing 5.9% of domestic PCG
assets under administration. The domestic suite balances represent our lowest cost deposits as we have yet to
utilize enhanced yield savings accounts to attract cash deposits. Total bank loans grew 2% sequentially to a
record $44 billion, reflecting growth at both Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank.
Moving to slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record result,s with quarterly net revenues of $2.06 billion
and pre-tax income of $434 million. Asset-based revenues declined. However, the segment's results were lifted
by the benefit from higher short-term interest rates, including increased yields on RJBDP fees from third-party
banks and the Bank segment.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $295 million and a pre-tax loss of $16 million.
Capital Markets revenues declined 52% compared to the record-setting results in the prior year and quarter,
mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues largely due to the volatile and uncertain markets.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $80 million on net revenues of $207 million. The
decreases in net revenue and pre-tax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under
management as the net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by a year-over-year
fixed income and equity markets decline.
The Bank segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $508 million and pre-tax income of $136 million.
Net revenue growth was primarily due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the bank's net interest
margin to 3.36% for the quarter, up 144 basis points over a year ago quarter and 45 basis points from the
preceding quarter, reflecting the flexible and floating rate nature of our balance sheet.
And now, for more detailed review of our financial first quarter results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul
Shoukry. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on slide 8. Quarterly net revenues of $2.79 billion were flat
year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees declined 10%
compared to the prior year quarter and 4% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we
provided on last quarter's call based on lower fee-based assets at the end of the preceding quarter due to the
equity market declines. This quarter, fee-based assets grew 8%. This growth should provide a tailwind for asset
management and related administrative fees, which we expect to increase 5% to 6% in the fiscal second quarter,
reflecting two fewer billable days.
Brokerage revenues of $484 million declined 13% compared to the prior year's fiscal first quarter and grew 1%
over the preceding quarter. The year-over-year decline was largely due to lower fixed income and equity
brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment, as well as lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG.
I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. In a much more difficult market environment
than we anticipated on last quarter's call, investment banking revenues of $141 million declined 67% compared to
the record set in the prior year quarter and 35% compared to the preceding quarter.
Despite a healthy pipeline and good engagement levels, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing
of deal closings given the heightened market volatility. At this point, it is too difficult to say when conditions will
become conducive to increase creativity.
Other revenues of $44 million declined 45% sequentially primarily due to lower revenues in the affordable housing
investments business, which was seasonally high in the preceding quarter. Looking forward, this business
continues to have a strong pipeline.
Moving to slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $60.4 billion, down 10% compared
to the preceding quarter and representing 5.9% of domestic PCG client assets. The sweep balance declines were
experienced in the client interest program at the broker-dealer, as well as with third-party banks. As of last Friday,
these balances have declined to just under $57 billion, reflecting the quarterly fee payments of approximately $1.1
billion paid in January, as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month.

The Raymond James Bank deposit sweep program continues to be a relatively low-cost source of funding, and
TriState Capital Bank adds an independent deposit franchise, providing a more diversified funding base. And as
we have seen deposits decline significantly across the entire financial system, we realize even greater value in
having multiple funding sources. To that end, we are also in the process of launching an enhanced yield savings
program for our Private Client Group clients.
Turning to slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $723 million, up
253% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 19% over the preceding quarter. This strong growth reflects the
immediate impact from higher short-term rates given the limited duration and high concentration of floating rate
assets on our balance sheet.
Our longstanding approach has been to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets, which is proving to
be a significant tailwind in this rising rate environment. The bank's net interest margin shown on the bottom
portion of the slide increased 45 basis points sequentially to 3.36% for the quarter. And the average yield on
RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 87 basis points to 2.72%. Both the NIM and the average yield
on RJBDP balances increased more than we expected on last quarter's call as the deposit beta on the last rate
increase was closer to 15%.
The spot NIM for the Bank segment is currently close to 3.5% and the spot yield on RJBDP balances is
approximately 3.2%, so we currently expect continued near-term tailwinds for net interest income and related fees
despite the ongoing cash sorting activity. The anticipated rate increases should also help, but remember, there
are two fewer days in the second fiscal quarter.
While we still have sweep balances with third-party banks that could be redeployed to the Bank segment, longer-
term, if rates stabilize at these levels, we expect the Bank's NIM will be impacted by the mix of deposits
anticipating a larger portion of higher cost deposits being utilized to fund the future balance sheet growth. While
we are pleased to see the significant NIM expansion, as we have said in the past, we have always prioritized net
interest income over net interest margin, and our goal is to continue growing net interest income as we
deliberately grow the balance sheet over time.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 11, beginning with our largest expense, compensation. The total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 62.3%, nearly flat from the preceding quarter. The adjusted compensation
ratio was 61.7% during the quarter. Despite lower Capital Markets revenues, the compensation ratio largely
reflects the significant benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.
As a reminder, the impact of salary increases effective on January 1 and the reset of payroll taxes at the
beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter. Non-compensation expenses of $398
million decreased 13% sequentially. Adjusting for acquisition-related non-compensation expenses of $11 million
and the favorable impact received of $32 million, both included in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments, non-
compensation expenses were $419 million during the quarter. The bank loan provision for credit losses of $14
million in the quarter primarily reflects changes to macroeconomic assumptions used in the CECL models, as well
as modest loan growth.
I'm proud of our continued [ph] discipline (00:18:18) management of expenses exhibited again this quarter, where
we remain focused on investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. Given
the benefits from higher short-term interest rates, we expect to maintain our compensation ratio well below 66%
as it has been around 62% over the past two quarters even with much lower revenues in the Capital Markets

segment this quarter. Non-compensation expenses excluding provision for credit losses and the aforementioned
non-GAAP adjustments are still expected to be around $1.7 billion for the fiscal year.
Slide 12 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated a pre-
tax margin of 23.4%, a very strong result, highlighting the benefit of our diversified business model, the upside we
preserve to higher short-term interest rates, and our consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses. Similar to
my comments on the compensation ratio, given the interest rate tailwinds, we currently believe we are well
positioned to continue delivering pre-tax margins above the previously disclosed 19% to 20% target. However,
given the cash sorting dynamics as well as interest rate and market uncertainty, we believe it is premature to
formally update our targets in this volatile environment.
On slide 13, at quarter end, total assets were $77 billion, a 5% sequential decrease, primarily reflecting the
decline in Client Interest Program cash balances. The reduction of balance sheet assets helped increase the tier
1 leverage ratio during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent
ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. The tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.3% and the total
capital ratio of 21.5% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized.
Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation
that vested during the period. Going forward, we still believe 24% to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in your
models.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In December, the Board of
Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares 24% to $0.42 per share and authorized share
repurchases of up to $1.5 billion, replacing the previous authorization of $1 billion. During the fiscal first quarter,
the firm repurchased 1.29 million shares of common stock for $138 million at an average price of $106 per share.
As of January 25, 2023, $1.4 billion remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase
authorization.
Since the closing of the TriState acquisition, on June 1 through January 25, we have repurchased approximately
3 million common shares for $300 million, or approximately $100 per share under the Board authorization. We
remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState as well as share-based
compensation dilution and still expect to achieve our objective of repurchasing $1 billion of shares in fiscal 2023,
but of course we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we plan for these
repurchases over the coming quarters.
Lastly, on slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remain healthy. Criticized loans as a percentage
of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.01%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a
percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 0.92%, down from 1.18% at December 2021,
nearly flat sequentially.
The year-over-year decline in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for
investment reflects the higher proportion of securities-based loans, largely due to the acquisition of TriState
Capital Bank. Securities-based loans, which account for approximately 34% of our bank loan portfolio, are
generally collateralized by marketable securities and typically do not require an allowance for credit losses.

The bank allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment
was 1.64% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely
monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints [ph] and a (00:24:48) potential recession on our
corporate loan portfolio.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I said in the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results and our ability to generate record
earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market, and while there are many uncertainties, we believe
we are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.
In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the expected 5% to 6% sequential
increase in asset management and related administrative fees. Additionally, the segment will continue to benefit
from higher short-term interest rates, as described by Paul. Focusing more on the long term, I am optimistic we
will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-
focused values and leading technology and production solutions.
In the Capital Markets segment, while M&A pipelines remain healthy, the pace and timing of the closings will be
heavily influenced by market conditions. And in the fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing
declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our
brokerage activity. However, SumRidge, with its rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology
marketplace, enhances our position as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility. Over the long
term, we are well positioned across capital markets for growth given the investments we have made over the past
five years, which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter up
7% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive.
We remain confident that the strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment
will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James
Investment Management, which generated modest net inflows this quarter, to help drive further growth through
increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies, and the Bank segment is well positioned for
rising short-term interest rates and has ample capital to grow the balance sheet prudently.
However, in an increasing rate environment, loan growth will face headwinds until rates stabilize and borrowers
adjust to a new normal in the cost of borrowings. Additionally, as cash sorting has continued in the sweep
program, we expect to increase the focus on funding the growth of the Bank's balance sheet with higher cost
diversified sources over the long term.
Currently, we have sweep balances at third-party banks that could be redeployed to the Bank segment; however,
the past has also taught us that cash sweep balances can decrease or increase rapidly depending on market
conditions. Importantly, the credit quality of the Bank segment's loan portfolio remains strong and we are closely
watching economic conditions related to the lending portfolio.
In just a short period since the closing of the acquisition of TriState Capital, I am very pleased with their
performance, staying true to TriState's independent operating model, including remaining a separately chartered
bank with its own client relationships. This model coupled with our strong capital should foster its ongoing growth.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
It's no accident that our businesses are positioned well for future growth. It is a result of our steady focus on
making decisions for the long term, especially in volatile and uncertain market conditions. We are well positioned
for the continued rise in short-term interest rates with diverse funding sources, solid loan growth, high
concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given the solid capital ratios, which are all
well in excess of regulatory requirements.
Finally, in these uncertain times is when clients need trusted advice the most and I want to thank our advisers and
associates for their unwavering dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day. Our
strong results are a direct reflection of your contributions, so thank you very much to all of you.

Good. Nice to speak with you after the press release in the evening, which is great. I guess just a couple quick
ones on my end. First, on the buyback, so you repurchased $138 million, it's a bit below the implied $250 million
average target and so I guess the implication's there's going to be some catch-up. So I'm just trying to understand
the factors that impacted the cadence, whether it was being price conscious or were you in blackout through the
quarter that we didn't see, or maybe any other reasons just trying to think about again kind of the cadence there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, we're still targeting the $1 billion of repurchases for fiscal 2023, as we've said several times now. And so that
obviously means we would have to ratchet that up on an average basis going forward to get to that $1 billion
mark. There was a lot of volatility in this particular quarter, and then as you point out, there's always a blackout
period. So we were pleased to get $136 million in but understand that to hit our target going forward, we're going
to have to kind of increase that average.

But with that being said, we're still going to – a lot can change between now and the end of the fiscal year, so we
do monitor market conditions and all the sources and uses that we have for cash and capital of the firm.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Got it, okay. Thank you. And then just to follow-up here on net interest income in private clients, so that's been
obviously very strong and that came in better than we were looking for. And we see the decline in the, kind of the
Client Interest Program, and so just trying to think about the other drivers there, was the kind of continued
strength there driven by margin and just higher margin rate or – some of your peers had some sec lending that
helped as well so I'm curious if there was any kind of lumpy sec lending in there just trying to think about some of
the moving parts that's keeping that really strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Sec lending was not a driver. Really, it was just the higher yields on both the segregated assets pursuant to the
broker-dealer regulations as well as the higher yields on the margin balances. But I will point out going forward,
sort of the last in, first out type of cash is really the Client Interest Program cash and that has declined the most
dramatically during this cash sorting cycle. And so we're probably at around $3 billion to $4 billion of those
balances today versus sort of the average balance for the quarter of $6 billion.
So that would be something you would need to consider, which would partially be offset by the higher rates going
forward as well factoring in a full quarter of last quarter's rate hikes and potential rate hikes this quarter, but
something that you would need to factor into your modeling.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. If you look at – I think almost everyone has offered enhanced yield programs today, they're not new, we
just haven't had a need for them because of the amount of client cash we've had. As that dwindles more and just
even as a defensive mechanism, we will offer them. And that's the account, whether people have money markets
and want an insured product, which we have, or if people are thinking of moving their money, they have a
competitive yield without moving their money into sweeps, I mean, into money markets or fixed income products
or things.
So that's really – a number of firms in the industry have primarily been relying on that. We haven't because of the
cost of funds, but as we've had – we're reaching an area where we've always said that if we get to this area, we'll
offer some of those products. The competitive rates in today's market are probably between 3.75%, 4%. It would
cut some outliers on either side, but that's the cost and what our competitors have been doing and – to the point
that we're going to make sure we're always on the positive side of cash.
Good news is even at those much higher rates, we can still earn a spread. And also, since we really have all low-
yield deposits and almost virtually zero high-cost deposits, adding some will just be – it won't be as big of an
impact on our cost of funds as most places have significant deposits today.

Great, thanks. And then maybe one just on the recruiting environment. Is there anything seasonal kind of about
turning the calendar that would be sort of advantageous as it relates to kind of attracting and recruiting advisers?
And perhaps if you could also just kind of touch on just any of the dynamics around transition assistance and what
you're kind of seeing in the marketplace? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, thank you. I mean for years, everybody said, well, we hear it's competitive. It's been competitive a long
time, it continues to be competitive. I would say that the competitive environment's about the same. I'd say the
only new in the last year is there are some third-party RIA aggregators that have paid more than the other firms,
competing for people in the adviser space.
But we are at a very strong backlog. Last year, our employee division led the way and set its own record and our
Independent division was a little slower in the first quarter. The independent's recruiting faster and the employee a
little slower, I mean through one quarter, but what we see is the backlog's very, very strong in both division, very
large teams. So we still feel good about the recruiting and it's – if you just look at the last few years, I think we've
been right up at the top of the charts on net new assets and recruiting.

I wanted to ask a question on cash sorting. Can you comment on the broader trends in cash sorting? We're sort of
getting closer to that 5% of client assets that has been a lower end of the range in the past, so is that 5% still a
good base for where cash should settle and how quickly do you think we'll get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the true answer is no one really knows. That 5% number was based on that 2016 to 2019 period, so we
don't have a lot of, as a industry, a lot of great historical benchmarking because, of course, even in that 2016 to
2019 period, the Fed funds target topped out at 2.5%. And so arguably, client sensitivity around rate is heightened
when you're at today's Fed fund target rate and – the yields that you can earn on your investable cash balances.
So 5% is good a guess as any, but we're certainly not hanging our hat on that potentially being a floor, which is
why, as Paul says, we are looking at all the diversified sources of funding that we can offer our clients, that would
be attractive to our clients, and also gives us additional appreciation of the TriState Capital franchise because
they have a independent and diversified funding source as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I don't think we try to figure out where the bottoms are. When TriState joined us and we talked about diversified
funding, I think a lot of people said, well, why are you even bringing that up, you've got record cash deposits?
Well, we always anticipate these time frames. And just in 2019 where we started – ready to roll out some higher-
yielding products because no one wanted cash, all of a sudden, we got flooded with cash again overnight. So we
know these dynamics can change and change rapidly.

And so cash sorting, as we reported, has continued. Whether 5%'s the bottom or it goes a little lower, don't know.
A lot of the lower balance deposits which are significant have been very, very steady, so at some point the higher
deposits will probably find a home where it's material enough at today's rates to make a difference and the lower,
just like bank accounts, it's not enough to make a change. So we're just – we always prepare and fear the worst,
but generally – because you just don't know. So I wish, I hope 5% is the bottom but we'll see, and we'll be
prepared if it wasn't.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay, great. And then in terms of deposits, you noted you're allocating more deposits to the bank rather
than a third-party bank program. So is there a specific loan-to-deposit ratio or liquidity level that you're thinking
about maintaining at the bank, and how should we think about this going forward if cash sorting continues at the
same rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The biggest constraint on that is just sort of the percentage of BDP sweep deposits that we want in our own
bank, because we always wanted there to be a cushion of balances that are swept to third-party banks in case
balances, as Paul said, do decline more rapidly than we expect. So that's really kind of the governing factor. It's
roughly at 75% today in terms of the amount of the BDP sweep cash that is going to our own banks.
Maybe it will go a little bit higher than that. I mean of the $14 billion to $15 billion of cash with third-party banks
today, a good portion of that could be swept over to our own bank while still preserving clients' FDIC insurance
that we offer them, which is best-in-class in the industry, by the way, as far as we can tell. But we also want to
make sure we're being prudent and not exposing ourselves to funding risk by shifting too much over.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We have plenty of capital and liquidity so our first source is to fund the banks, that's our business. And then
to the extent is – the sweep is really a cash overflow in a lot of ways but a good part of our business model. So
right now, we're not alarmed, we still have flexibility. But at some point, we've known people that have gone up to
90% of cash or something, we just – that's a little too leveraged for us.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Good evening. Thanks for the question. Just apologies for a two-parter but it is related. So I'm hoping to
just better understand the balance sheet strategy for you guys from here. So, on the one hand, Paul, you talked
about slowing loan growth in this environment, and then at the same time, you're talking about launching an
enhanced yield product on the deposit side despite the fact that you have lots of liquidity in third-party bank
deposits [ph] still (00:42:55).
So maybe help me understand, how much of that $18 billion third-party bank is ultimately sweepable to your
bank, how big the enhanced yield program you think ultimately will be for you guys over the next 12 months, and
how are you thinking about the overall growth at the bank in terms of the growth in assets?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So the growth – ultimately, the growth in the bank is driven by client demand, right? And so as Paul said in
his prepared remarks, that client demand is experiencing headwinds now that interest rates are on the move, as
you would expect. Until they get used to the new normal of interest rates, we expect those headwinds to continue.
But one thing we will not do is when client demand does slow down naturally given the rate environment today,
we're not going to stretch for growth or get into asset classes that are not really client-oriented.
With that being said, in terms of the funding, we always want to prepare for the future. One quarter is certainly not
a trend, and so we want to be there for our clients, whether it's a year to two to five years out from now. And so
we want to make sure that we're diversifying our – and strengthening our funding sources so that we have the
ample funding for when client demand does come back, because we know it will eventually come back, we just
don't know when or how quickly it will be. So that's sort of how we think about the strategy, so long-term strategy
versus trying to manage it quarter-to-quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think in terms of the amount is we don't know. So what you do is you turn on the program, start raising money,
and you can always accelerate it by letting more clients know, pushing it more, changing the rate in the
competitive market. I mean you have lots of levers to speed it up. You certainly can slow it down, or you can stop
it, so – but you can't do any of those unless you start it. So we have the technology up and running, we've got it
tested, and now we're going to go out and open it up to a degree.
And if we need it more, we'll spread it out to a broader base of the adviser segments. And if it ends up being more
than we need and we see cash goes the other way, we'll slow it down or turn it off. So it's about being prepared.
And it's the same in TriState, it has third-party sources, too, and we've said, just prepare to turn them on, make
sure they're there, get interest, and then if we need them, we could be more aggressive; if we don't, we could just
stop. So it's just a balance.

Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions, and also appreciate you moving back the conference call to
tonight. Just following up on – [ph] so this (00:46:05) last line of questioning, as you think about earning asset
growth, A, can you grow that in an environment where there are sorting and mixed loan demand; and, B, if it does
grow, could you talk a little bit about the sort of decision-making between loan growth and the investment
securities portfolio? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Again, right now, in a tighter funding environment and more uncertain funding environment, we are certainly
prioritizing client demand and client funding needs over the securities portfolio, just like we prioritized the security
portfolio when we needed to accommodate surplus client cash balances. Again, our balance sheet's primarily
there for clients and that's how we – that's kind of a difference between how we think about our balance sheet and
many of our peers, is that we really do think about the client demand, both on the asset and on the funding side.
So, yeah, in terms of the loan growth going forward, as Paul says, we really don't know what it's going to be. What
we're not going to do is force or stretch for growth, but we will continue to provide – have our advisers provide
excellent advice for their clients. And to the extent that they're – need mortgages or securities-based loans or our
corporate clients reengage in M&A and they need financing, then we want to be there for them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. And then just a follow-up, maybe switch back to capital for a moment, obviously, you said a pretty strong
capital position, as you both have mentioned. Can you update us on what your latest thinking is on where you'd
like to have that tier 1 leverage ratio settle out? And I think you've mentioned a couple times of opportunities to
deploy your capital. Will you be able to buy back – would you buy back the full $1 billion or is it a function of
potential M&A? And if you're interested in M&A, where might you be looking? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, yeah, let me go backwards into the question. First, we like organic growth the best. It's been our focus
because it's sustained, it's large, consistent net new assets, even when we're not doing acquisitions in the PCG
space, we're still growing. But we like acquisitions for the right targets and we can't tell if and when those would
happen. I think the last few years, people doubted if we were serious and we closed three deals pretty quickly. So
our goals right now in our balance sheet, we gave a tier 1 target of 10%, we're still at that target.
It's gone up faster. Good news is part of that's earnings. But the other reason is just really the shrinking of the
corporate balance sheet, too. As cash has come off the balance sheet, that ratio went up without really a lot of
changes. We're still committed to it, we're committed to the $1 billion target, as Paul mentioned in his remarks,
that we want to do with $1 billion this year. We got partially there this quarter, and we know we have to get more
aggressive to hit that, but we're – that's our plans.
In terms of other capital, we'll always say, if the great acquisition showed up tomorrow and it required a lot of
capital, would we use it instead of buybacks? Possibly. Is this accretive? Advantaged? Don't have one, so I don't
– theoretical question. But if it did, we'll always balance what's the best use of the capital. But our plans right now
is to focus on our commitment to hit that $1 billion target.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Paul, maybe on just the NII thoughts. If you think about average Fed funds could be
up – if you look at the forward curve, could be up close to 90 basis points in the first quarter versus the fourth, but
then you have sort of this mix shift in deposits, you have higher spot NIM going into the first quarter. So, how do
we think about NIM and NII in the first quarter? And how you're thinking about the trajectory? You kind of
mentioned you want to grow NII. Can you do that consistently? Or do we – should we expect the negative mix
shift starts to hurt NII growth after 1Q? Just trying to think there whether it's 1Q or full year or whatever you want
to want to give us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Obviously, there's, Jim, a lot of variables that kind of go into that. But as we look into our fiscal second quarter, I
mean, we're entering in with a spot rate of 3.5% for the bank's NIM – for the Bank segment. And so, that's before
any additional benefit from further rate hikes potentially. And so – and we have grown the bank's portfolio, up 2%.
Their assets have grown 2% sequentially. So, net-net, when you sort of think about the fact that there's two fewer
days in the second quarter than the first quarter, we still believe we will be able to grow net interest income overall
in the second quarter. And that may – that will likely be offset by a decline – partially offset by a decline in the
BDP fees. Just because the balances are down, probably the average balances sequentially will probably be
down 20% to 25%, as we've put up a greater proportion of the funds to the Bank segment. But again, we'll have a
higher spread on those balances. We're entering in with a spot rate of 3.2% versus the average yield that we
earned during the quarter – first quarter of 2.7%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think also is we'd have to really hustle on raising high-cost deposits, which [indiscernible] (00:52:00) significant
enough to have a huge impact on that number in the shorter term. But obviously, if the cash dynamic and sorting
continues, that will start impacting as we raise. So, we'll just have to see how that goes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, on admin comp and PCG was up, I think, 21% year-over-year, 7%
sequentially, is that a new run rate or is there some intersegment? Because I did notice that the comp and
benefits line in Corporate/Other was down 20-plus percent. Was there some kind of shifting of those kind of costs
among segments or is that just a higher upward pressure in that line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Jim, I would tell you that the first quarter comparisons to the fourth quarter are always a little bit noisy just
because in the fourth quarter we're always trying to adjust the bonus and benefit accruals to reflect the actual
results for the fiscal year, and then we sort of reset those accruals in the first quarter. So, I think, last year at this
time, it was like an 11% increase in PCG admin comp as an example.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
So, there's some – there's a lot of noise comparing the sequential – year-over-year, of course, we have
acquisitions. We have the Charles Stanley acquisition for the full quarter this year in PCG, as well as just kind of
overall growth of the business in the PCG business.
With that being said, in the second quarter, we do have the impact of the payroll tax reset as we enter the
beginning of the calendar year. And then, we also will see the impact of the salary increases that have become
effective on January 1. And those salary increases this year were significant. As we always have done, we always
want to share in the success of the firm with our associates who make that success possible. And particularly in
this inflationary environment, given our record results in the fiscal year, we did – we were generous in passing on
salary increases to our associates, and that will be reflected fully in the second quarter.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. [indiscernible] (00:54:27) question. Just given the forward curve and market expectations now
for the Fed to begin cutting by year-end 2023 and into 2024, I was wondering if you could help us think about
deposit betas through a declining Fed funds environment. And I think during the last rate cycle, the adjustments
on yields are the betas on the way down for the first few cuts in 2019 are relatively high and help support the bank
NIM. I guess, is it fair to look back towards that last cycle as a good guide for how you would kind of manage your
deposit rates this cycle as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. We're still having a hard time being exactly right on what the deposit betas are in this upcycle. So, certainly,
trying to predict what it will be in a different cycle is very difficult to do. It'd be based on the competitive
environment and a lot of other dynamics that apply at the time. For example, in the last rate cycle, we had surges
in cash balances because it was due to the pandemic. And so, when rates were cut, we obviously did not have a
funding need per se. We actually had cash, so we have to figure out how to place. That may not be the case next
time rates decrease.
I don't think you can compare different cycles just because each one is so unique. So, most people are sort of
guessing that the deposit betas on the way down will be symmetrical to what they've been on the way up. I guess
that's a good guess, but we really don't know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then, just maybe a follow-up just on the net loan growth in the quarter. Just wondering if
you could help us understand some of the dynamics by loan bucket, and I know we'll see some more infills within
the Q, but it looks like demand for SBL has been a bit weaker. And so, it looks like you're seeing decent demand
for mortgages, even with the tough backdrop. So, just given the rest of this year – this fiscal year, I guess, where
should we expect more of the loan growth to really come from? And should we kind of expect that slower SBL
demand to persist near term?

Yeah. We actually do provide the line-by-line end-of-period loans in the supplement. So, it's kind of buried in
there. I know we provide a lot of materials, but there is some more detail there. But you are right, the SBL
balances declined sequentially. And that was due to, frankly, a lot of repayments as the interest rates went up
dramatically over the last three to six months on those lines, and so residential mortgages went up, but a lot of
that was due to mortgages that were in process even before the quarter. As you know, mortgages take a while to
go through the underwriting and closing process.
So, as we said earlier, we don't know really what the dynamic is going to look like going forward. It's going to be
based on client demand. We do expect until the rates settle out and clients get used to whatever the new norm is,
we do expect headwinds for growth across all loan categories, both floating and fixed really, because the fixed
coupons are up as well, although we don't do much in the way of fixed. But certainly, mortgages is a category that
borrowers are still getting used to, 5.5% to 6.5% across the industry when it was just 3% to 3.5% a year-and-a-
half ago. So, it is a pretty dramatic change in a pretty short period of time.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I know you've touched on this a couple of times, but I'm still a
little confused, and so I'd love to ask a follow-up. Paul Shoukry, you speak about the liquidity in the balance sheet
often, and we can certainly see your liquidity on the asset side. And so, I guess I'm not 100% clear as to why –
what the impulse is to raise higher cost funding through this enhanced yield program. When you could, you simply
allow for some of the assets to run off, especially the stuff that's easily replaceable, like securities. So, could you
maybe clarify that for me?
And then, also, we've seen some competitors going to similar products in the last few quarters, and that has led to
a pretty strong mix shift in favor of the higher cost funding. Do you have any estimates or any rough idea about
how much mix shift to that type you'll see in your own deposit base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, to your point, Brennan, we are kind of continuing to let the securities portfolio run off. A lot of that
growth over the last two years is really accommodating client cash balances on the balance sheet. And so, we
really built that up well beyond our liquidity targets at Raymond James Bank. So, the answer is really kind of all of
the above when it comes to funding. We're doing that. We're also, as Paul said, making sure that we're prepared
on many other fronts when it comes to funding.
The enhanced yield savings, we're starting with a relatively small amount relative to our overall funding needs. But
the point that Paul was bringing up is that we just want to make sure that we have all of these sources turned on
and make sure that they're working, so we understand what the ability – capabilities are, the demand is, et cetera.
We learn from it. And then, to the extent that we need to drive more balances through various levers, then we
have the ability to do that. But it's hard to do that if you don't have it even turned on.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I don't know of other institutions that don't have CDs, enhanced wealth. They've been aggressively raising money.
Because of our floating rate balance sheet and our unusually high liquidity in both on our balance sheet and client
cash, we haven't had to. And that's been part of what's driven a lot of the earnings. But we could assume that
we'll have enough [indiscernible] (01:01:00) last forever or we can start the programs in case they continue to run
off more than the industry expects, and we'll still be well-funded.
So, the reason we're starting it is just in case. And if we need more, we'll accelerate it. So, it wouldn't be prudent
to wait until all of a sudden we really need it, and we don't have any of the programs in place. Most – there's many
other firms that have needed it, and they've been very aggressive because they didn't have that flexibility. We've
had the flexibility. But we're certainly going to – as we always, we look to the long term. And we're going to have it
in place and ready to go. And the only way you know you have it in place is when you're executing it and actually
collecting deposits and everything is working well and then you dial it up or you dial it back if you need it, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And the only other thing I would add is there's so much concern around mix shift, as there – understandably so,
but it's not like the cash isn't moving. We have the best purchase money market fund platform in the industry as
far as I can tell. It's institutional shared classes offered to any size client. And so, it's not like the cash is moving to
other higher-yielding destinations as it should, and the financial advisers help their clients with those type of
decisions. So, to the extent that we can offer an attractive product on balance sheet that meet clients' needs,
some are still concerned about money market funds, frankly, because they didn't perform very well in the last
couple of cycles. So, we have to offer an FDIC-insured product, which keeps the funding on the balance sheet
and actually earns a better spread than if it goes into some of those other products could be a win-win. So, that's
kind of how we're looking at it as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Sure. Totally get you on the substitutes being broadly available. And any sense of your expectations for
magnitude of how big this program could be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, because it really, frankly, depends on the levers that we pull, right? We have levers around the rate we offer,
the size – the count that we limited to, the size of the deposit, et cetera. So, as Paul said, most of our competitors
have already come out with it and had to be aggressive because in the last couple of years, they deployed almost
all of their deposits to fund balance sheet growth. We always said, and we took a lot of criticism for it a year or so
ago, that we wanted to keep that cash very flexible. And so, we don't have the same acute pressures on funding
that they have had over the past six months. And so, we're able to be more deliberate in sort of figuring out the
right balance for clients and for the firm.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Thanks so much for squeezing me in here. I just had one final question on Capital Markets, and more
specifically, the profitability or, I guess, like they're up in the quarter. I recognize one quarter [indiscernible]
(01:04:10) you did incur the pre-tax loss in the segment. What I wanted to better understand is, given the lack of
complex that we saw within the segment itself, how you're thinking about managing expenses and comp if you
remain in a challenging investment banking backdrop?
It's a question we're getting quite a lot because the pre-tax margin was strong for the firm. The comp ratio was
certainly well-managed for the firm overall. And at the same time, you didn't get the positive comp leverage this
quarter, and much of that was obscured by cap market. So, any insight you could provide there would be really
helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. So, I mean, the capital markets have been difficult for everyone. And the part of – there's a couple of factors.
One, it didn't have a good quarter. But secondly, compared to a lot of other firms, we don't have any unallocated
overhead. So, there are other firms that certainly had lower results, but every penny of overhead is allocated to a
segment, so you see a fully loaded P&L, and it's not the case in a lot of other firms who – if they had, might have
a little bit of a different answer or closer answer.
It was an off quarter due to, first, both M&A, and we all know what's happening with that slowdown and with
underwriting. And the fixed income business, again, we talked about the cash dynamic at third-party banks. So, it
was challenging. So, we'll do what we always do. First, we have a very variable comp structure that our bonuses
– our basis, although we raised them, are still lower than a lot of places. And we – as we did two years ago, right,
we took big pay cuts. You could see them even through the executives the year before, this year. So, we have a
variable comp structure. We'll take care of that. And then, we'll have to just look at the business and make
whatever adjustments in those businesses we have to.
The good news is corporately, we're actually – we've been very conservative. Although we've hired a lot of
people, we have a lot of open positions, and we're just being less aggressive with hiring and making sure we keep
the people we need through these cycles. So, we don't go in like the tech companies, way overloaded. And I think
in Capital Markets, they're just going to have to look at what businesses are there and what support they need to
make those decisions. So, I don't – but certainly, we don't plan any sizable layoff programs that you've read in

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Great. Well, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us. And again, just overall, I don't think too many people are
showing record net income to shareholders this quarter, but I think it's a testament to the model and – but there's
a lot of uncertainties going forward. We all know it. We all knew the questions you'd ask, and we're committed on
the capital repurchases, with the only contingency if something comes up that we think can drive more
shareholder value. And on the cash and cash sorting, good questions. We could run models and give you
answers based on them, but our experiences, they all vary from that. So, we're just – we're going to raise as
much cash as we need to support the business, and not raise it if we don't need it. And so far, that served us well.
So, appreciate you joining the call, and talk soon.
