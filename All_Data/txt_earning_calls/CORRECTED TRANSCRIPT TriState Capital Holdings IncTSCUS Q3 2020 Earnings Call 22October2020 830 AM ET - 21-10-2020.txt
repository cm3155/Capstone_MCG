James F. Getz
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We're very proud of what TriState Capital's team has accomplished
for our clients and shareholders in these extraordinary times, delivering financial results that reflect the power of
our adaptive and scalable franchise. All three of our business lines, investment management, private banking,
and commercial banking, are functioning extremely well and growing handily in the atmosphere that we find
ourselves operating, while maintaining superior asset quality metrics and optimizing our balance sheet.
This is a company that is nimble and has a predisposition toward action and delivering responsible growth. We
believe there are many highly positive developments worth discussing. But since we hosted a call just last week
to announce our $105 million growth capital raise, I'll keep our prepared remarks brief to provide additional time
for discussion during Q&A today.
Our third quarter 2020 performance was highlighted by total revenue of nearly $47 million, up from both the linked
and year-ago periods, supporting year-to-date revenue growth by more than 6%. Growth in Chartwell assets
under management to pre-pandemic levels and very healthy positive net inflows of client assets and continued
strong investment performance. Annualized total deposit growth of 18% during the quarter with 28% growth in
strategic treasury management deposits. Annualized loan growth of some 27% during the quarter with national
private banking loans continuing to expand at a strong clip to record levels and commercial growth from very high-
quality borrowers within our regional footprint.
And a continuation of our superior credit metrics, additionally, COVID-19 related deferrals declined more than
earlier forecasted to-date. Our increased provision brought the allowance within range of our year-end estimate
when we intend to adopt the CECL accounting methodology. Today, this company includes nearly $10 billion
asset bank and a $10 billion AUM asset manager.
As we continue to manage through this historic low rate environment, the power of our asset management and
swap fee-generating offerings shines through with non-interest income that made up 28% of revenue for the
quarter. Our branchless business model which serves a regional commercial footprint and clients nationwide
through private banking and investment management is very well positioned for long-term responsible growth.
Our Chartwell investment management subsidiary is in as strong a position as it's ever been. Assets under
management, net flows and institutional pipeline to Chartwell continued to grow in the third quarter driven by a
very solid performance by our strategies relative to industry benchmarks. For the three years ended September
30, 2020, 77% of our strategies outperformed the relative benchmarks and 85% outperformed them for a five-year
period. Positive net flows are up 3% organically year-to-date, our institutional new business pipeline, which
includes business that has been won, but not yet funded, currently exceeds $200 million.

Chartwell's annual run rate revenue continues to grow to $34 million as of September 30. And with strategic
decisions made during the past 12 months to reduce expenses for this business segment, Chartwell EBITDA in
the last three months hit its highest level in five quarters.
Meanwhile, TriState Capital Bank, again, delivered double-digit loan and deposit growth, as it continued to
expand the number and depth of its banking relationships. Quarterly deposit growth of 18% annualized to more
than $8 billion at September 30, 2020, supported a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 93.5%. This deposit growth
included expanded treasury management deposit accounts, which had been an ongoing and strategic focus of
our company on a national level, as well as continued progress and broadening the overall client base for our
deposit.
To that end, cost of deposits averaged 67 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2020, and
overall cost of funds decreased to 77 basis points for the period. We believe our model positions us to be agile in
managing interest expense through volumes and rates on existing and new liquidity, as we move through the next
phases of the recovery. Our private banking business continues to set us apart from peers and the industry in
terms of both its contributions to our balance sheet and to our low credit costs. These loans which made up more
than 58% of total loans at September 30 increased an annualized 39% during the third quarter.
Our potential to continue growing this business has been outstanding as demonstrated by the acceleration of
growth in 2020. Our referral network grows consistently each quarter. Private bank loan applications were up 65%
during the third quarter and 51% year-over-year to new record levels. We also continue to increase our number of
financial intermediary firms which is now at 235.
Our very strong and diversified regional middle-market commercial banking business also performed well in the
third quarter. Commercial loans grew 2.8% during the quarter. We saw healthy commercial and industrial new
loan and originations, including our equipment finance offering offset by amortization payments on the portfolio
and expansion in our fund finance offering related to capital call and liquidity facilities, offset by amortization
payments and normal pay downs in the existing portfolio of revolving lines of credit. This resulted in a modest
decline in C&I balances from June 30.
Commercial real estate loans grew $103 million primarily through new fundings for our existing and known clients,
showing strong borrower conviction and balance sheets. This growth also reflects lower offsetting reductions from
payoffs and pay downs, which as expected were approximately 60% of last year's pace.
As we outlined last quarter, we have limited exposure to some of the businesses that have been more negatively
impacted by COVID-19, including hotels, restaurants, senior housing, and healthcare real estate, non-renewable
energy and retail commercial real estate. These industries together accounted for 5.9% of total loans at
September 30 and reflect the strong portfolio management and fundamental underwriting we employed for all
lending. We are pleased with the positive trends we've seen with respect to COVID-19-related deferrals. As of
October 20, we had deferral arrangements in place with 48 loans totaling $186 million, representing 2.4% of total
loan balances. This is down from the modest levels we updated you on in April and July. The pace of deferral
exits is ahead of our earlier forecasts. We're proud to be a source of support and stability to our clients as they
manage their businesses through the ongoing public health and economic crisis.
TriState Capital's credit metrics continue to be a major differentiator and we believe that we become even more
evident moving forward in the current economic environment. On our $7.6 billion loan portfolio, non-performing
loans of $6.8 million, primarily relate to a single CRE loan, which we note was not a part of the deferral program.
All loans were paying as agreed, and we reported zero net charge-offs in the third quarter. We increased our
4

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
allowance for loan losses by 130% over the last year and 32% during the third quarter to $30.7 million. We
believe we've conservatively built general reserves, reflecting the differentiated and exceptional quality of our loan
portfolio. The majority of which constitutes private banking loans that are primarily collateralized by marketable
securities. As we previously shared with you, our estimate for allowance at year-end when we intend to adopt
CECL is a range between about $30 million to $35 million. This would represent about 85 to 105 basis points of
commercial loans.
With each of our investment management, private banking, and commercial banking businesses performing at
very high levels and serving great, growing numbers of clients and financial intermediaries, we truly believe the
growth opportunities for this company have never been more clear or more attainable than at this moment. And
we now have the capital needed to seize those opportunities and drive meaningful earnings growth in the future
for the benefit of all our shareholders.
As we announced last week, TriState Capital signed a definitive agreement to raise $105 million of new capital
from funds managed by Stone Point Capital. The financial services-focused private equity firm has extensive
experience working with best-in-class financial institutions, and we are confident that they understand and fully
believe our company's ability to deliver long-term growth. Including this latest investment, which we expect to
close in the fourth quarter, we've raised more than $200 million in capital in 2020 alone.
During the year when many companies are simply trying to weather the storm, TriState Capital is on course to
continue a record of execution, growing total assets next year by another $1 billion to $2 billion, support our
exceptional double-digit organic loan growth to sophisticated private banking and commercial clients, continue to
invest in the proprietary technology and superior talent that has enabled us to become the dominant, independent
provider of securities-based lending to financial intermediaries and their high-net worth clients, and continue to
grow Chartwell Investment Partners organically and opportunistically through acquisition.
Ours is a business model that's been built, tested and refined over the last 14 years to deliver responsible growth
in any environment. Our strong and liquid balance sheet, scalable and capital-efficient businesses, and
branchless model, that serves as a regional and national footprint positions TriState Capital to adapt to the
exceptional business conditions we're all facing and succeed over the long term. We believe that our valuation
should better reflect our [ph] above peer (00:14:33) opportunities.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Would you kindly open the lines?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from
Michael Perito of KBW. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, Michael.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, Jim, David, good morning. How are you both?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to – obviously, we just spoke a little while ago after the capital
raise, but I wanted to maybe expand upon the profitability conversation we started a couple of weeks ago. And I
guess, first, I just was curious, can you break out – I know – I believe in your segment reporting, you don't
necessarily look at it this broken out. But can you talk a little bit about, kind of, what type of ROA that the private
banking business is generally putting off today? And then, the second part of the question is this, what are the
levers with the race to zero? We talked about the inflection point on the capital call. But can you maybe give us a
little bit more details about what some of the levers are? And what some of the drivers are of that profitability
inflection point, and where we can maybe expect that number to start trending as we move forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, Michael. This is Jim. As a result of few of the communications that we had this morning from the analysts
that made my early morning reading, I thought it would be helpful to give you a clear articulation of how we look at
this quarter and year from a business perspective that blends into what you're indicating. And then [ph] this will
give you some (00:16:34) specific answers on what your question is.
Let me provide you with a couple of sound bites of what has been accomplished. We are positioning this
company for success in the future. At times decisions will be made that may impact near-term performance, but
have long term positive implications.
Now, let me give you a couple of observations to reinforce this. Look at the commitment this company has made
to technology. We determined on our income statement to really characterize technology very clearly in – on
there. And you'll notice that over the past several quarters since we initiated this, this year, we're spending about
$2.5 million on a quarterly basis. And I'm going to give you a little more details of what that has resulted in, since
there is some concern about the expenses. But note the credit experience that our clients have had not just for a
quarter, not just for a year, for multiple years, our investors and how the credit experience has been highly
6

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
positive. We have one non-accrual loan in place in $7.6 billion loan portfolio. We have $17.7 million of classified
loans and we have this quarter no accrual loans 30 days or more delinquent, but that hasn't been just this quarter.
It's been multiple quarters over the years.
No bank has comparable organic loan growth or credit metrics quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. And in
the 14 years of existence of this company, we've had all of $57 million of net charge-offs. We regret that, but it's a
relatively low number relative to the industry. Our extraordinary deposit growth without a branch system is by
design from a risk management standpoint and serves us well as an ongoing funding mechanism.
Look at the deferrals, our folks reached out and met with these clients in February and March. And as you note,
they've been reduced to 2.4% of the loan portfolio from initially 6%. The investment portfolio we're growing handily
is a risk management mechanism. Some of you may have noticed we put forward a gain in that portfolio of some
$3.7 million this quarter.
Let me tell you what drove that. We made a determination that the corporate bonds in that portfolio were
overpriced. We took advantage of the gain, and we sold out at that point. And if you would look at the corporate
bond market today, we made a right decision at that point. And what we invested in were governments and
reduced meaningfully the risk profile of that portfolio by design. $105 million of additional growth capital was just
recently raised. We've raised $200 million of growth capital in the past nine months, all to prepare to position this
company going into the New Year and into the future.
We have significant opportunities, have been executed on in the past 9 months and reflected in the growth
numbers across all three of these businesses. Every once in a while, a business is out of sync, but in this year, all
three of these businesses have been robust. The balance sheet is strong as it's ever been, 58% of the loans have
liquid collateral that's priced daily and over collateralized. There's probably not a single bank in this country that
58% of their loans are priced every single day, and the collateral is liquid and counted. Non-interest income, 28%
of our revenue, another reduction of the risk profile. And to take a -- keep in mind when we're raising money
whether it'd be through fee income or interest income, it's not instant gratification. It takes a year to feel the full
impact of that money coming in.
[ph] Thus (00:21:23), they're dropping dramatically. Technology, what we were just talking about is accelerating
the growth from a robotic standpoint. We're putting in place robotics in order to supplement the professionals that
we have in place on the administrative side of it. We have a commitment to a lending platform that we're helping
to fund with [indiscernible] (00:21:52). And this is a lending platform on the commercial banking side. It's three
years out to be delivered. And that's how we look at planning in that regard. And the digital lending platform that
we have in place is supporting about 60% of our clients at this point.
And the next point is quite important, our revenue. Our revenue is up 6% year-to-date over the past nine months.
Assets under management have fully recovered from the March debacle in the marketplace and growing
meaningfully with [indiscernible] (00:22:30). So the point of what I'm illustrating here is, we have in place a strong
foundation for the future, a $10 billion bank and a $10 billion money management firm going into 2021 and
beyond. And what we ask ourselves and this is most important, is what needs to exist to take this company from a
$10 billion bank to a $20 billion bank, and a $10 billion money management firm to a $50 billion money
management firm over the next several years in a responsible manner.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Mike, good morning. I don't have specific numbers to share with you. But let me share with you a couple of
themes and then let me wrap it up with a comment. First of all, I'm not sure that in all cases people look at their
credit quality and the net interest margin together as it relates to private banking. I think that gets disaggregated
sometimes, right? So you really need to think about those two because they – those two together because they
really work in unison with one another in terms of the credit quality being a driver of the overall return of that
particular business. We've also been very successful in dropping deposit costs meaningfully in private banking
this year. And so that's been helpful. And while I don't have specific numbers for you, we are looking at better
ways to tell our story in terms of the individual businesses.
One of the other stories that I think we can do a better job of telling is the free cash flow that Chartwell is
generating, they have added, their EBITDA last quarter was $1 million, it's $1.5 million this quarter. We see that
going to above [indiscernible] (00:24:21) and those EBITDA margins going from sort of high teens to mid-20s next
year.
And so there are some things that we're working on to think about how to better portray some of the drivers of this
business. And so -- don't have specific numbers for you today, but stay tuned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
Yeah. And Mike this is Brian. I would add I think certainly, when we look at it, we are seeing improved yields and
spreads for all-in yields across all of the categories commercial and private bank. So, we believe that as cost to
deposits in particular comes down costs of funds obviously lagging a bit as we roll in the cost of capital that we've
raised.
But as you look at those categories, we think that there are significant levers to enhance ROA there. One of
those, obviously, is cost to deposits. The next is volume management. We believe that there's a lot of -- volume
management that we'll continue to do within the franchise both particularly over the next two quarters, I mean,
absorb the [indiscernible] (00:25:32) to respond to the sort of situation we had going on in the pandemic and just
recovery in markets.
Others, utilization rates through that business. So, utilization rates being a client engagement, client education.
So, that obviously driving revenue through existing clients are already on the books will be a significant piece. As
Jim mentioned, scalability is huge business. So, that's a big lever. So, really, when we look at ROA, I think if you
wanted to say it's a nine-inning game, we're second, third inning in what we think we can drive through the
business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. That was helpful. Thank you, all. And then, just as a follow-up kind of staying on the similar topic.
Jim, you mentioned kind of some of the investments and why you guys are making them. But just if we just look at
the model for a second here and just look at the expenses, that $31.4 million core in the third quarter. Jim or
David or Brian, any broader specific thoughts about kind of where we can expect that to trend moving forward? I
mean, it seemed like – if I'm interpreting your comments correctly, like there were some, I don't know if pull
forward is the right word, but some investments that you guys thought were necessary to make and we shouldn't

necessarily envision expenses growing at that type of rate. But just any more specifics or detail you could put
around the numbers, that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I think the one thing before I turn it over to David I'd like to point out is the compensation program. And
we've talked before that what we have in place here, every individual that works at this company is on some type
of formulaic program and including our relationship managers, and the sales personnel at Chartwell. And I was
alluding to in my earlier comments, business has brought in the full implications that business may take a year or
so to come into play whether it be a loan, a deposit, an investment in one of our funds in that regard. And that's
why you see the – what you noticed in the compensation aspect of it. David can address the others or even
maybe give you a little more color on the compensation. But obviously, we had a very good quarter from the
standpoint of raising up assets on the lending side and also in the investment management side and that
impacted us immediately on accruing for year-end bonuses, but it did not. It's not reflected in the income
statement as of right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So Mike, let me touch on a few themes here in terms of expense growth. You've heard Jim talk a few minutes ago
about our ability to grow TriState in the current environment. The growth has driven some expenses higher as you
point out, as we position the company for what we feel is a very strong fourth quarter and strong next year 2021.
And so to put some things in context, one of the primary increases this year compared to last is in the FDIC
insurance premium, which were was noted in some of the earlier reporting this morning on us. It's a bit distorted.
Last year, we received $1 million credit in conjunction with the FDIC reserves hitting their targeted levels, their
thresholds. And so, net-net, that expense is about – is up about $1 million year-over-year.
Another thing that's a bit distortive is the state capital shares tax. Last year, third quarter, we benefited from a tax
refund that we received of approximately $700,000. We've got $300,000 expense this quarter. And so, net-net,
there is about $1 million swing there.
Jim just commented on and we've shared with you in the past that we have a highly variable nature of
compensation here at TriState. Sales employees earn a salary that's fixed and most of their compensation is
performance-based. We had solid results this quarter and this year in swap income, loan growth, and deposit
growth. And these sales efforts will drive results in NII as Jim indicated in the current quarter, fourth quarter and
next year.
We've also incurred some expenses in the surge resources to handle some of the operational elements of our
growth this year. To keep things in perspective, compensation last year increased meaningfully from the second
to third quarter as the formulaic sales targets were achieved. And I might also add that compensation expense
this quarter is very similar to third quarter last year. It's actually a bit lower. Professional fees are higher this year
as we prepare to cross the $10 billion threshold. We've been very deliberate in our planning and have involved
some outside resources to assess our readiness and make sure we're well-prepared from a compliance and risk
management standpoint.
And finally, let me comment on other operating expenses. There's two very important priorities at play here.
Employee well-being is an absolute priority of ours. We've implemented a number of protocols in the current
environment to keep our employees safe and that's driven some expense increase. We've also been very focused
9


TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
(TSC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
on the wellness of our communities and have meaningfully increased our charitable contributions this year to
worthy causes nominated by our employees. And so that's a bit of context in terms of the quarter. As we look
forward, if we hit sales targets you will see compensation stay at these levels but most other expenses, that
growth should be modest quarter-over-quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. So, if you guys continue to grow obviously, comp will continue to grow. But some of the jumps elsewhere,
certainly, should be behind you although not necessarily that the numbers will revert back down, it's just the
growth rates should drop off pretty significantly?

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go to credit and your allowance levels are now at $30
million, which I think is the lower end of that CECL adoption range we've discussed now for a few quarters. So,
with that, do you think this allowance build that we've seen in the last few quarters is now complete for the most
part? Just trying to get a better idea of what the future provision expense will look like over the next few quarters.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Matt, good morning. Jim and Brian have both talked about our credit quality here a little bit this morning. Our
credit quality in our business model, we think, speaks for itself. Over the past 14 years, TriState has only charged
off $57 million of loans. We're very pleased with the overall credit portfolio, which is driven by a seasoned team
and a lot of focus on strength of sponsor.
Classified credits are still very low and we're very pleased with the progression of the deferrals as Jim pointed out.
You've also heard Jim comment on the fact that we're in line with the estimate on CECL as of December 31. We
believe looking into 2021, that it will be a better year economically and the CECL models will reflect a more
favorable environment. And so, we believe provisions will come down meaningfully next year as we look to
[indiscernible] (00:33:33) improvement in the economy.

Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then what about the interest-bearing deposits that those [ph] bottomed back (00:33:44)
in 2015 around 50 bps. Can you talk about the ability to kind of get that down to similar levels over the next few
quarters?

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I'm sorry. Interest-bearing deposit costs. You talked about bringing those down in the next few quarters and
having some more room to go back in 2014-2015 timeframe? I think that bottomed around 50 bps or so. Just
curious if you think you can get down to similar levels again this cycle. Obviously, it's a much bigger balance
sheet, just looking for some puts and takes about, if you can get down to similar levels again this cycle.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to kind of follow up a little bit or talk a little bit more about the margin. You've talked about hoping to
get a – get back to the 170 range by the end of next year. And in the release, you mentioned that you should see
expansion starting here in the fourth quarter. But can you just talk a little bit about what type of interest rate
assumptions are in that? And then what you would see – I know you touched on this on the capital call last month,
but what you would see or what you would expect with no kind of change to the current interest rate environment?
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, Danny, maybe I'll start and then I'll ask Brian to comment on sort of where loan yields are for the current book
and new loans we were putting on. And so we had some NIM compression from 1.52% to 1.46% during the
quarter. Our deposit teams are out there working on relationships that take time to develop and in areas like
treasury management and private banking. And we had opportunities to add some large relationships this quarter,
and so we took advantage of that.
We really feel we're poised for good growth in the quarter, fourth quarter and next year. And that includes our
expansion of NIM. And we raised the capital and liquidity this year and it takes some time to put that to work. The
subordinated debt will get more fully deployed here soon. We've raised a lot of liquidity in deposits. That will get
put to use in loan growth and, to a lesser extent, in the bond portfolio. And we will continue to review discretionary
price deposits and make adjustments where warranted.
And so I think we've shared with you in the past, a year from now, we expect our NIM to be somewhere in the
1.70% range. And in current – in terms of current pricing, maybe I'll ask Brian to join me and comment on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
Yes. Thanks. Yes. I think, again, staying on the deposit side, obviously, we are – we do look at 2020 as – we look
at it in terms of providing us a couple of opportunities for acceleration just like other industries have. And one
thing it's accelerated, we believe, is our ability to answer the question how do you fund loan growth in $1.5 billion
to $2 billion range per year. And I think that 2020 showed us – showed a lot of people how exactly we do that.
The timing of those things, obviously, we think we're pretty efficient about it. We dealt with, obviously, some
exogenous events that aren't normalized business situations in 2020. But we think as we look forward here again,
our ability to be agile and efficient in timing deposits coming on in concert with the opportunities for us in the loan
growth, and the investment side, yeah, will continue to improve.
So, that's just the volume side which we're estimating as sort of probably 5 basis points of NIM in the third quarter.
So, when you look at that plus our normal – what we do believe we can do on the pricing side and just the
composition including through treasury management and continue to work with our clients, which will be a
premium to market. But, obviously, market coming in and premiums are relative. So, we believe we can sustain
the brand, sustain the client names we've built here, and still improve the cost of deposits.
And then as David said, cost of funds continues to sort of spread out as we deploy the capital. On the loan side, I
think, we're seeing, generally speaking, we're pretty happy with the cost of – the yields that we're getting between
floors and spreads at this point. We're seeing consistent with last quarter. Our C&I loans probably in the 2.50%,
2.75% to 3.25% range. CRE is probably in the 3.25% to 3.75% range. And private banking in the 2.25% to 2.90%
range from again all-in yields with floors and spreads.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
So, we think it's a pretty favorable environment right now to be in the markets where we are to work with our
existing clients. We're getting good opportunities. They have high conviction and we're getting correspondingly
good pricing at this point in the cycle. So, we do look at that as the – some of the levers for NIM expansion in the
next four quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great. Thank you for all the color there. And then changing gears here just quickly, if you could give as
much details as you're able to on the composition of the remaining deferrals. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yes. So, as we look at it, again, 2.4%, we have a bit of – it's still – it's sort of a two-thirds CRE composition as we
roll through the fourth quarter here. As we look forward to getting through the fourth quarter, it probably will shift
mainly into CRE. We expect that to be under 1% of total loans as we exit the quarter. So – but what we're – what
we are pleased with – again, we didn't set up the deferral program as a risk management tool per se. It was a way
to work with our clients.
And I think as Jim characterized it in the first quarter, it was a way for us to invest alongside our clients to help
bridge them to a more stabilized economy. We're pleased with the way they have managed their businesses. And
as they're able to return to normal loan payments and this is just anecdotal, I don't have total numbers on you but
– for you. But we do have a number of clients that are actually repaying the deferred balances, which is promising
and also a testament of sort of the conviction of type of clients that we work with.
So that suggests obviously cash flows are good. [ph] That conviction is high (00:41:09) to meet the obligations
and they're seeing a bit of a normalized business environment. But composition here, pretty similar to what we
talked about for two-thirds real estate, one-third C&I. But again, that'll change – that'll shift a little bit primarily to
CRE as we exit the year and – but we'll end up with a much smaller number obviously, as total loans as we
[indiscernible] (00:41:31) quarter.

Operator: The next question is from Russell Gunther of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on the C&I conversation. Appreciate the color about the dynamics
at play this quarter. Could you touch on catalysts for growth in that loan vertical going forward? I think equipment
finance typically has a good 4Q, but any additional color there would be appreciated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
Yes. I mean, you picked up well. The third quarter was pretty good for equipment finance. The fourth quarter is
generally a good quarter for equipment finance. I mean, we obviously look at ways to continue to spread that
13

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
across the year, but, yeah we do it. We expect the fourth quarter this year to be another solid one for equipment
finance.
If you look at the second quarter to the third quarter, a bit of that, as we indicated, as our loan growth there was
offset a bit by obviously, some amortization payments. Pay downs on the revolvers were primarily in our fund
financed business really. And so that's fairly idiosyncratic. We had a nice balance in there at the end of the
second quarter and a number of those just got paid down at the same time in the third quarter.
So, we expect utilization there to pick up in the fourth quarter. Overall, we look at more of a normalized average
outstanding rate in that business, particularly, as we continue to grow it. And we look at our fund financed
business combined with our liquidity facilities and our broker/dealer and other financial institution. Business is
probably approaching $600 million in commitments. So, as we continue to grow that, and have a bit more of a
normalized consistent constant outstanding there, that'll provide a little bit more on the average assets
outstanding basis. But – so those are levers of growth.
But I will say we are probably more performing better than expected on even traditional C&I business. So we are
seeing opportunities with existing businesses that are looking to move banking relationships as some of their
other banks to either focus internally or just reposition their focus on business.
So again in this middle-market space where we do really well, some of the really large banks are potentially losing
focus on some of these middle-market clients. And so we are seeing opportunities in our traditional C&I, more
than I think we would have expected two quarters ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate the color there, Brian. Thank you. And then just my only remaining question is a ticky-tacky one on
the tax rate outlook for the fourth quarter. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Russell, happy to try to answer that question. As we shared with you, we strive to have an effective tax rate
somewhere in the mid-teens. The tax rate is driven in part by tax credits which, as we've shared, happen
episodically. It's been a quiet year on that front. There may be an opportunity or two here in the fourth quarter that
will develop. We'll have to see if that holds true and see how things progress from here. And so we continue to
strive for a tax rate in the mid-teens, and we'll just – we'll see if we're able to get there by year-end or not.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just want to drill down more on loan yields. I think the overall yields are now
2.49% and I think it was Brian that gave us the pricing by loan type. I'm having a hard time reconciling these
various ranges to the overall loan yields of 2.49%. What am I missing? Is there some notable exception pricing?
I'm just having a hard time appreciating why the yields are where they are versus the ranges that Brian gave us.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Yeah. I mean, I think, I mean, part of that obviously is we're talking about new business coming on relative to the
historic book, which obviously we're tail-wagging dog sort of thing, right? So yeah, we're making meaningful
contributions every quarter and then we're growing $400 million a quarter. We're certainly, that lever becomes
more powerful and will have a continued bigger impact on there. With those four opportunities for example that we
did put in on the private bank business and some other businesses historically, those are being deployed on the
commercial side and are pretty standard in the market at this point. So again, we'll – we believe we'll see yields
continue to push up a bit from here. But again, it's the new contributions to yield, obviously, takes some time to
change the overall complexity for the overall makeup of the loan yields. But we're certainly not seeing – not going
to see compression of that loan yield, which is pretty stabilized at this point with forward-upward motion there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Is there any color you can give us on what the new and renewed loan yields were in the third quarter of the
growth that you guys had?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
Yeah. Those – I mean those yields that I gave you are pretty indicative of that. So on the C&I side, again, I mean,
obviously, fairly general and broad from – for a variety of reasons. But 2.50% to 3.25% on the C&I side, 3.35% to
3.75% on the CRE side, primarily was – some were higher than that. And then on next – on the private bank side,
2.25% to 2.90% type range. So, to your point, there will be some idiosyncratic things that happen again in a
quarter, yeah, within each of those businesses, but those are averages – average range that we think are pretty
indicative of what's coming on. So again, that – even in a quarter where we did $400 million, but we're talking
about $400 million underneath $1 billion bulk rate. So, it'll take some time to continue to make those adjustments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then shifting over to Chartwell, saw some really good improvements in this quarter,
revenue and EBITDA. It sounds like you expect incremental improvements even from here. I think the margin
moving from 15% to 25% and quarterly EBITDA moving up to $2 million. Those would each be really good
improvements to see. Any more color on timing of when you expect this or details of how you expect to get there?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. A lot of it, Matt, has to do with the perfection of the distribution model that we have in place there now. As I
had mentioned, we currently have over $200 million of institutional business that should be converted in the fourth
quarter. It's a little more difficult converting this business quickly because most of the people we're dealing with
they're working remotely. But both the institutional and the retail sales force have done a tremendous job in a
difficult environment that we find ourselves in, retail business is about a little over 20% of the assets. So, you're
going to continue to see a lot of positive activity coming out of Chartwell. Just look at the type of investment
performance that we have. And that's what these folks are selling. And we have it pretty broadly quality
investment performance. So, we're looking forward to a successful year. Tim and his team have really done a nice
job. And I believe you'll see the EBITDA continuing to improve along with revenue growth over the next several
quarters.

Operator: The next question comes from Joe Plevelich of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Plevelich Q
Analyst, Boenning & Scattergood Inc.
Good morning. Just a quick question on the incremental cost as we breached the $10 billion asset threshold. Do
you have a rough idea of what that might be or are there some other opportunities to, perhaps, offset some of
those costs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So, Joe, those costs are largely one-time in nature, right? There were costs to prepare to get over $10 billion.
They were cost to do gap analysis and assessments, making sure we've got the right systems in place from a
compliance, from a regulatory risk management perspective, capital management, and the other models that
maybe we'll start to focus on as we cross $10 billion. And so, those are more one-time in nature.
As we get above $10 billion, I would remind folks that we don't have a retail franchise, right? And so, interchange
fees and some of the other costs will not be as impactful to [ph] offset us to a typical bank across to (00:51:02)
$10 billion. And we don't have a retail franchise and so some of the other cost just won't be all that impactful. So
we're actually looking forward to crossing $10 billion and hope to be there soon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
Yeah. And I think I would just add on – so that certainly shows up on the professional fees and maybe some of
the other expense. I think the – as we look at some of the other adjustments that we've made, we've added a lot
of – we have added people to the team. I think we're excited about the contributions that everyone is bringing that
we've added on. So we've taken a run at it, we've continued to expand the expertise of the team.
And people are not just contributing within a vertical. It's everybody is really contributing to make us better. And so
we're – I think as David said, we're excited about the return on the investment to sort of getting over $10 billion.
We're actually really excited about the talent and people as well as some of the technology we've added to get
over there. So [indiscernible] (00:52:18) that'll be one-time charges particularly on the professional fees and
OpEx, the other expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Plevelich Q
Analyst, Boenning & Scattergood Inc.
Gentlemen, my other question is just so the FDIC insurance expense debt, that there was nothing funky or
elevated this quarter that's a good run rate here? Or could this somehow moderate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
You'll see some modest moderation, some slight moderation. The average balances – as average balances sort
of settle in, you'll see some moderation there. There was quite a growth here in the past quarter or two in terms of
16


TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
(TSC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
some of those balances and the way they came on, but that'll change. And I think I shared earlier that the
comparison year-over-year is a little bit tough because of the refund last year by the FDIC. But the pace of growth
in the FDIC insurance premium should level off from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian S. Fetterolf A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Bank, Inc.
And obviously, yeah, average assets, obviously, unique this year particularly the last two quarters being driven
more by liquidity than loans, right? So we went – we were down at 91% loan-to-deposit, 93%. Again, that average
assets being the fundamental base of FDIC insurance. We'll continue to use those deposits and sort of go within
the business, within the growth we're expecting over the next two quarters or so. So I think, as you pointed out,
the rate of growth in the FDIC insurance will slow particularly compared to revenue.
