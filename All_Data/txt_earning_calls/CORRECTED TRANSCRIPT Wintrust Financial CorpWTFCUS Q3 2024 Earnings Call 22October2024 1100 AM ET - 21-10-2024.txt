Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Thank you, Latif. Good morning and thank you for those on the phone joining us for the Wintrust third quarter
earnings call. In addition to the introductions Latif made, I'm joined by Dave Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer;
and Kate Boege, our General Counsel. In terms of an agenda, I'll share some high-level highlights, Dave Dykstra
will speak to the financial results, and Rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance
and loan activity. I will be back to wrap up with some summary thoughts on what we expect for the remainder of
2024. And of course, we'll do our best to answer some questions at the end.
Before we dive in, let me remind you that this quarter has a few more moving pieces than normal, as it includes
two months of the results for Macatawa Bank. We closed on that transaction during the quarter on August 1. For
the quarter, we reported net income of just over $170 million and reported record net income of just under $510
million for the first three quarters of the year. These results were in line with our expectations and we remain
encouraged by underlying activity and pipelines.
We grew loans by $2.4 billion, $1.3 billion acquired from Macatawa and another $1.1 billion organically. We grew
deposits by over $3.4 billion, $2.3 billion from Macatawa, and $1.1 billion organically. Importantly, we reduced
higher rate brokered deposits by over $800 million at quarter-end, an immediate benefit of the excess deposits
from the Macatawa acquisition. The organic loan growth, organic meaning excluding Macatawa, was balanced
across all material product categories, which continues to illustrate the benefit of our diverse asset-generating
businesses.
The organic deposit growth included absolute growth in our non-interest-bearing deposits, and the percentage of
non-interest-bearing deposits relative to total deposits remained stable for the quarter. Both the loan and deposit
results are strong evidence that we continue to gain share in Chicago, the surrounding markets, and in our niche
businesses. In fact, for the Chicago MSA, Wintrust increased deposit share to 7.7%. In contrast, the two largest
banks in the MSA, Chase and Bank of America, lost deposit share. This is data from the June 30 FDIC reports.
The net interest margin of 3.51% was in line with our expectations, and combined with organic growth and the
Macatawa acquisition, produced record net interest income of $503 million, up approximately $32 million from the
second quarter. I know many of you remember Wintrust as asset-sensitive and well-positioned for the rate
increases over the past few years. It's important to note that we are now very currently balanced in terms of
interest rate sensitivity and well-positioned for an orderly movement of rates downward.
We expect our margin to remain near current levels for the coming quarters and accordingly should experience
net interest income growth. On the credit front, non-performing loans remained low, essentially flat from the
second quarter, and charge-offs were down for the quarter. Again, Rich will walk through the credit results and will
offer some additional detail on the loan growth in just a moment.
A quick note on mortgages, although we tend to get a lot of questions, at current levels, mortgages remain
relatively insignificant in terms of the financial impact, apart from the MSR valuation. On that front, as you know,
it's rate-sensitive and there can be some fluctuation. Rates since quarter-end are back up, and given today's rates
versus those from the end of the quarter, it's likely the valuation adjustment has been recovered.
In terms of new mortgage activity, there were a few days during the quarter where rates dropped and it looked like
we might see a pickup in mortgage production, which could have been helpful, but that has not lasted and
mortgage activity remains muted. Our Mortgage business, however, remains an effective hedge for us if rates
trend lower and a core part of our client offering.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Our two other major fee-based businesses, our Treasury management activity and our Wealth businesses,
continue to exhibit steady growth. Overall, a solid quarter, in particular, our team continues to do a very nice job
with respect to pricing and credit discipline, which will continue to show up in our results and specifically in our
margin going forward.
With that, I'll turn this over to Dave and Rich, and I'll be back to wrap up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, Tim. First, with respect to the balance sheet growth, Tim mentioned the strong loan and
deposit growth in the third quarter, excluding the impact of Macatawa, that produced a balanced $1.1 billion of
growth for both loans and deposits. The loan growth net of the acquisition was nearly 10% on an annualized
basis, in line with our prior guidance of being in the upper end of our mid to high-single-digit loan growth forecast.
Also including the impact of Macatawa, we ended the third quarter with a slightly reduced loan-to-deposit ratio of
roughly 92% compared to the 93% at the end of the prior quarter. I think it's important to note that non-interest-
bearing deposits increased by approximately $708 million in the third quarter, relative to the second quarter, with
that growth driven mainly by the non-interest-bearing accounts associated with the Macatawa Bank acquisition.
Total non-interest-bearing balances have remained stable at 21% of total deposits as of the end of each of the
first, second, and third quarters of this year.
As to other aspects of the balance sheet results, total assets grew by approximately $4 billion to $63.8 billion, and
our capital ratios increased slightly due to the strong earnings and the impact of the Macatawa acquisition.
Turning to the income statement results, this was a very solid operating quarter for us, but as Tim mentioned, the
quarter had a few moving pieces. To that end, I'll start off by highlighting what we consider the uncommon items
and what they were for the quarter. From our perspective, the quarter included a non-recurring day-one provision
for credit losses related to the Macatawa Bank acquisition of $15.5 million, unfavorable mortgage servicing rights
activity of $11.4 million, acquisition costs of approximately $1.6 million, with a negative impact of those items
offset by security gains of $3.2 million. Each of those items are discussed on the second page of the earnings
release, if you'd like to refer to them later.
The quarter results were impacted by the inclusion of Macatawa's operations for two-thirds of the quarter. So, I'll
touch on each of these topics during the remainder of my comments, but I just wanted to set the table with those
items. Our net interest income increased $32 million from the prior quarter and represented a record high level
amount of quarterly net interest income; a $3.1 billion increase in the average earning assets, including the
addition of the Macatawa franchise for the last two months of the quarter and a stable net interest margin
contributed to the increase in net interest income.
Our second quarter net interest margin was 3.51%, which was stable compared to the 3.52% net interest margin
in the prior quarter. Yields and rates on the major balance sheet categories were relatively flat, with the loan
yields at 6.90% for both the second and the third quarter. And interest-bearing deposit costs were down 1 basis
point from the second quarter. Given the current rate environment and the consensus forecast for additional
interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, we remain confident that our net interest margin continued to be in a
narrow range, around 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025.
Given our relatively stable net interest margin outlook and the projected continued growth in earning assets, we
would expect to, again, increase net interest income in the fourth quarter. We recorded a provision for credit

losses of $22.3 million in the third quarter, which included the one-time non-recurring day one CECL provision of
$15.5 million related to the Macatawa Bank acquisition. Excluding this one-time day one acquisition related
provision, the provision for credit losses would have been approximately $6.8 million, which is down from a
provision of $40.1 million recorded in the prior quarter and the $20 million amount recorded in the third quarter of
last year.
The lower provision expense in the third quarter relative to the second quarter was primarily attributable to lower
specific reserves and non-accrual loans, improved forecasted macroeconomic conditions and to a lesser extent,
portfolio changes related to an improved risk rating mix and an overall shorter life of the loan portfolio. Rich
Murphy will talk about credit and loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit.
Regarding the other non-interest income and non-interest expense areas, non-interest income totaled $113.1
million in the third quarter, which was down approximately $8 million when compared to the prior quarter. The
primary reason for the decline was due to the unfavorable mortgage servicing rights related revenue of $11.4
million, mostly due to negative valuation adjustments as mortgage rates dipped here in the end of the quarter.
Mortgage production revenue was also down slightly, as gain on sale margins narrowed on what was slightly
higher originations for sale production volume.
Those reductions in mortgage revenues were offset somewhat by a $7 million positive change in gains and losses
on securities. I should also note that the prior quarter included an approximately $5 million gain on the sale of
certain premium finance loans, which did not reoccur in the third quarter. And although we do hedge a portion of
the MSRs, large movements in interest rates may cause some valuation impacts both positive and negative, and
the dip in the interest rates at the end of the third quarter was a cause of the current quarter negative valuation
adjustment. But as Tim noted in his comments, subsequent to the end of the quarter, mortgage rates have risen,
which at the quarter, were down at these levels, because of a positive valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter.
Turning to non-interest expenses, non-interest expenses totaled $360.7 million in the third quarter and were up
approximately $20.3 million from the second quarter. The primary reasons for the increase were, first, the non-
interest-bearing expenses associated with the Macatawa Bank acquisition were approximately $10.1 million,
including a $3 million core deposit intangible amortization expense. As this additional $10 million is only for two
months of the quarter, we would expect approximately $5 million of additional Macatawa-related expense in the
fourth quarter to account for a full quarter's worth of activity.
Non-operating acquisition-related expenses were approximately $1.6 million in the third quarter, compared to $0.5
million in the prior quarter. The remaining increase of approximately $9 million was primarily related to salary cost
for increased staffing to support the company's growth, higher incentive compensation expense accruals and
increased software expense associated with upgrading and maintaining IT and information security infrastructure,
and furthering our investments in digital products and services.
Now, the non-interest expenses, we believe, were well-controlled when considering the impact of the acquisition,
even with that impact of the acquisition, non-interest expenses as a percent of average assets declined to 2.36%
for the third quarter, compared to 2.38% in the prior quarter and 2.41% in the third quarter of last year. This
demonstrates improved expense operating leverage and we'll continue to try to bring those numbers down.
In summary, the third quarter results included a record level of quarterly net interest income supported by strong
loan and deposit growth, and a stable and solid net interest margin. The quarterly results also had good expense
control and stable credit metrics. Said another way, excluding the impact caused by the non-recurring Macatawa

day one related provision for credit losses and the MSR valuation adjustments, it was a really solid quarter for
Wintrust and we're very excited about the prospects for the remainder of the year and throughout 2025.
We also continued to build our tangible book value per share during the quarter. And as you can see on slide 12
of the presentation deck, we've grown tangible book value per share every year since we've been a public
company, and we're certainly on track to do that again in 2024. Additionally, as we've recently attended several
investor conferences where the topic of total shareholder returns was discussed on various occasions, we
included a new slide, slide 13 in the presentation deck that provides a graphical illustration of Wintrust total
shareholder returns for the last 1, 3, 5, and 10-year periods compared to the KBW Regional Bank Index Total
Returns. As you can see from that slide, Wintrust has consistently outperformed that Regional Bank Index, which
I think, illustrates resiliency of our operating model through a variety of economic cycles.
So, with that, I will conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich to discuss credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As Tim and Dave both noted, credit performance continued to be very solid in the third quarter. As
detailed in the earnings release, loan growth for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 10% annualized, excluding the
$1.3 billion in loans which we acquired through the purchase of Macatawa Bank.
As detailed on slide 8, we saw strong growth across all major portfolios. A couple of specific areas of note include
our asset-based portfolio, which grew by $243 million as a result of bringing on a number of new customers and
higher line utilization. The mortgage warehouse team had another strong quarter as a result of onboarding a
number of new relationships, which also come with some great deposit opportunities. We also saw continued
growth in core commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and portfolio residential loans. I would also note
that we remain highly focused on getting paid appropriately for our risk.
As noted on slide 8, we were able to keep our average loan yields consistent quarter-over-quarter. We believe
that loan growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be strong and aligned with our previous guidance of mid- to
high-single digits for a number of reasons. Fourth quarter volume for commercial premium finance loans has
historically been very strong. We believe the hard market for insurance, premiums should continue into next year.
In addition, our core C&I and leasing pipelines remain very solid. Finally, we saw core C&I line utilization rates
continue their upward trend from 37% to 39% quarter-over-quarter. Offsetting this growth will be a pressure on
our CRE portfolio, as we anticipate higher volumes in payoffs, as borrowers seek long-term fixed rate refinancing
opportunities.
In summary, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans at attractive rates and maintain our credit
discipline. From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 18, we continue to see strong credit performance
with signs of stabilization across the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Non-performing loans as
a percentage of total loans was down slightly from 39 basis points to 38 basis points.
While NPLs in total were up slightly for the quarter, it's interesting to note that NPLs in our CRE portfolio dropped
by $6 million. We've also seen two straight quarters of lower NPLs in our commercial premium finance portfolio,
as we continue to manage the stress from the transportation segment of that portfolio, and we are pleased to see
this trend improve as a result of tighter loan structures and enhanced underwriting.
Charge-offs for the quarter were $26.7 million, or 23 basis points, down from $30 million, or 28 basis points in Q2.
This reduction in charge-offs is a result of improved performance in our commercial premium finance portfolio and

our core CRE portfolio. Our portfolio continues to be very solid, well-diversified, and very granular. Additional
evidence of this can be seen in slide 18, where we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard
loans. We believe that this quarter's level of NPLs and charge-offs reflect a return to a more stabilized credit
environment, as evidenced by the chart of historical non-performing asset levels on slide 19.
Finally, we are firmly committed to identifying problems early and charging them down where appropriate, as
evidenced by $80 million of this quarter's charge-offs which have been previously reserved. Our goal, as always,
is to stay ahead of any credit challenges. As noted in our last few earnings calls, we continue to be highly focused
on our exposure to commercial real estate loans, which comprise roughly a quarter of our total portfolio. Higher
borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates continue to affect CRE valuations, particularly in the
office category.
As detailed on slide 22, we saw promising signs of stabilization during the third quarter, as CRE NPLs decreased
from 0.40% to 0.33%. And as noted earlier, we also saw CRE charge-offs reduce from 53 basis points to
essentially zero for the third quarter.
On slide 23, we continue to provide enhanced detail in our CRE office exposure. Currently, this portfolio remains
steady at $1.7 billion, or 13.1% of our total CRE portfolio, and only 3.6% of our total loan portfolio. Of the $1.7
billion of office exposure, 44% is medical office or owner occupied. The average size of a loan in this office
portfolio is only $1.5 million. We have only eight loans above $20 million and only five of which are non-medical or
owner occupied.
We continue to perform portfolio reviews on our CRE portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers. As
mentioned on prior calls, our CRE credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every non-owner
occupied loan over $2.5 million, which we'll be renewing between now and the end of the second quarter of 2025.
This analysis, which covered 84% of all non-owner occupied CRE loans maturing this period, resulted in the
following: roughly half the loans reviewed will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates; roughly 28% of the
loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a short-term extension at prevailing rates; the remaining loans
will require some additional attention, which could include a pay down or pledge of additional collateral.
We continue to back-check the results of the portfolio reviews conducted during prior quarters and have found
that the projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated, and generally speaking,
borrowers of loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support the loans by providing
enhancements, including principal reductions. As we have stated on prior calls, our portfolio is not immune from
the effects of higher rates in the market forces behind lease rates, but we continue to proactively identify
weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes.
In summary, we are encouraged by the trends we saw in the third quarter, and we believe that our portfolio is in
good shape and appropriately reserved. That concludes my comments on credit and I'll turn it back to Tim.

Okay. Thank you. That was a lot, I hope, helpful. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I'll be very brief. I would just
emphasize Dave's reference to the historical charts that we've included in our presentation materials. We have
performed well over various time periods and in different economic environments. We would expect that to
continue. Our pipelines remain strong, our credit approach is disciplined, we remain well-positioned to build share
in our Midwest markets and within our niche businesses. And with respect to Macatawa, it's still early, but our

integration activities are on target, and we remain very encouraged and bullish on the opportunities that we have
in West Michigan.
Overall, we like our position going into the last quarter of the year and into 2025 and certainly appreciate the
support of all of our shareholders.
At this point, I'll pause, and we'll take some questions, Latif.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC
Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Tim or Rich, you've touched on it, but can you talk a little bit more about the loan growth outlook and the
drivers? I'm just jotting down notes, Rich, in your comments. You talked about both new customers and higher
line utilization. And I think the line utilization is maybe a little bit different than what some of the peer banks are
talking about. So, can you break that down a little bit more and talk a little bit more about the mix and the
expected drivers of loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Jon, as you know, I think one of the keys for us is just having this really diversified asset portfolio,
because when some things are working, some things may not be working, a good example is, during the period of
very low interest rates, we saw Life Finance having very solid growth and as rates came up, their growth is more
muted. Similarly, over the course of the last year and a half, we saw very strong performance out of our P&C,
premium finance group. And so, that has been a huge driver. So, if you start with that for the course of this year,
they were up meaningful part of the increases we saw in the overall loan portfolio.
But then getting back to your specific question, you add on some of these other areas. So, we have seen in just
the core C&I and core CRE portfolios some incredibly good opportunities just as the competitive landscape in
Chicago has changed so much. And so, we are seeing – our pipeline right now is probably as full as I've ever
seen it in terms of really quality mid-market companies in particular. Our asset-based team has seen a fairly
substantial pickup in new opportunities.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
And then – and coupled with that, we've also seen that – we talked about it in previous calls, we picked up a
warehouse line of credit group out of Comerica that we brought on about just over a year ago and they've been
able to bring over a fairly substantial number of clients that they had and that's added, as I pointed out in my
comments, fairly substantial increase in those balances as well. Leasing has also been a good part of the story for
this year.
And so, again, it's not one thing that I would point to, but it's a number of these different things that all kind of
contribute to the total. So, the utilization number, we're encouraged by that. We think that, as rates went up, we
saw that utilization come down. So, it's possible that that may not be long-standing, but we would anticipate that
the utilization rates are probably at a level where we would anticipate them continuing for a while here. So,
hopefully, that gets at what you were asking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, it does. Okay. So, this feels like a comfortable pace of growth for the company, what you just put up from
an organic perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, we're not changing our guidance. We haven't changed our guidance in many
years just because, again, when something's working, something else may not. But when collectively, you add
them all up, it kind of hits in that spot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. That's helpful. And then, Rich, it's either you or Dave on this one, but I'd appreciate the carve out of
the day one CECL provision, the $15.5 million and we would carve that out. It suggests a higher run rate for EPS.
But the $6.8 million for call it, legacy Wintrust, the core seemed a little bit lower than we were expecting. So, I
don't know if you can help us think through what the provision might look like in the fourth quarter. I know that's a
little bit granular, but that might help us set expectations a little bit. Is this a new lower core run rate for provision
or is there – we should think about maybe a reversion to a higher number? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we gave some detail on slide 18 for the changes for the allowance, but from the provision, if there was some
benefit, the macroeconomic conditions got better. And so, some of the forecast for commercial real estate pricing
and some of the other factors that go into the model improved. So, that was helpful to keep the provision lower
this quarter. Prior quarter, we also had, $9.7 million net more specific reserves. And those relate to some of the
charge-offs, so we took this quarter.
So, it got ahead of those and then blew them out. So, that was beneficial that we didn't have similar specific
reserves and actually released some of them this quarter. So, I'm not really sure, Jon, depending on where
macroeconomic conditions go, but we would expect to have that mid to high-single digits growth that Rich talked
about and have to provide for that. And then, when you look at portfolio mix, our criticized classified numbers
have stayed very consistent and we don't expect those to necessarily get worse and they're pretty good right now.
So, there's not a lot of change there.

So, I think it's probably just growth that we would provide for going forward, adjusted for whatever the economists
do out there. But I don't know if the election will impact it positive or negative for the fourth quarter, but if you
would provide growth for mid- to high-single digits and a standard provision for that, that's probably my best
guess, because I just don't know which way the economic factors are going to go.

Good morning, David.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Now that we've got a one of – a rate cut in, out there, how has your
deposit cost trended? I mean, what has been your deposit beta since then? And how have you seen the
competition react to this first rate cut, both on the commercial side and then maybe on the consumer side, too?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. David, it's Tim. So, on the way up, our beta was in mid-60s, and we would anticipate that it would be similar
on the way down. And that, in fact, has been our experience with the first cut, which obviously we're not very far
into. But what we can tell you is that since the end of the quarter and as we start to see more of the cut work
through the portfolio, the reduction in deposit costs and the reduction in loan yields have been about the same,
which gives us confidence that the spread and ultimately the margin, should be in the same level going forward
here.
With respect to competitors, we've seen rates come down, promotional-type rates from the low-5s and 5% level to
the 4.25% to 4.5% level. And, we believe just given the kind of tepid loan growth that many competitors have had,
that as rates trend down, that they'll continue to try and move down. But obviously, that's the risk, is that if we get
some strange competitive behavior with respect to loan or deposit pricing, that we'll have to respond. We have not
seen that.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Got it. Thank you, Tim. And then, closing the acquisition of Macatawa in Grand Rapids, I know that's still going
through the integration process, but as you look forward there, what are your plans for potentially adding veteran
bankers and really leveraging that franchise?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, they have a terrific team. So, number one, we like a lot where we start from. And over time, as we
identify opportunities in the market, we'll certainly add the resources that they believe are necessary to fully
penetrate the market. We are seeing inbound inquiries on ESOP loans and construction loans and other kind of
specialty areas that they might not have pursued organically. And so, we're very encouraged by the early
feedback from the market.

Hey, Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q

Couple of questions on the credit side. I think you said the majority of the charge-offs came in that C&I segment,
and particularly, one relationship. Could you just remind us again the industry there and is that fully exited?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, yeah, it was more than just one. But where I would say the most – if I were categorizing the bulk of the
losses that we saw in the quarter were transportation-related.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Got it. Okay. And, Rich, hopping over to the office slide, there was a increase in that 30 days to 89 days bucket.
Your commentary was pretty positive. I just want to see if that increase was largely administrative. Any kind of
concerns with that early delinquency number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, it's interesting and it kind of touches on something that kind of how the sausage is made. When you're sitting
here, having these conversations with customers as it relates to rightsizing a loan or thinking through how you go
about renewing it appropriately, those conversations don't happen overnight. And so, occasionally, you will see
things go past majority as we work through those.
But ultimately, it's time well-spent, because we believe strongly that it's in everyone's best interest to get those
repositioned appropriately. So, I'm not overly concerned about that. I think that periodically that will happen as we
work with customers to try to make sure we get a good outcome there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Sounds like the overriding trend was more positive. It's the front end, just some mechanics. Maybe just one
last one, maybe for Dave, just on the expense run rate, trying to figure out, we've got full quarter of Macatawa,
maybe some cost saves in there, ex out some merger costs. So, any type of discussion about where that settles
in? And if you could hazard a guess on maybe 2025 growth rate, that'd be great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, as I said in my comments, we had two-thirds of the quarter with Macatawa at roughly $10 million for the
fourth quarter, because we have not gotten through the full integration and conversion yet, I would expect that
they add another $5 million just as a run rate. It gets in there. I don't suspect there is much change in the other
line items too much, but plus or minus a couple million dollars, I mean, a pretty big company, so you can have
some fluctuations here and there. But I would expect sort of adding $5 million plus or minus to the run rate.
And then, going forward, we've always sort of – in the last few years, sort of been in the sort of the mid-single-digit
expense growth rate, but that's under the assumption we're sort of high-single digit deposit loan growth rate, so
you get some operating leverage, but not necessarily ready to make a call on that yet. We need to see how the
mortgage business goes and the like, because that could certainly add some additional commissions and costs if
that picks up. But we don't have great visibility into that right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good morning. Dave or Tim, the capital improvement from the deal that was – I think, Telegraph put a nice bump
up for the growth. As you go into the next few quarters, can you just remind us where you'd like that CET1 ratio?
Dave, I believe, you have some preferred that get reset. Maybe there's a swap opportunity, but just capital
philosophy going into next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think you're right. We picked up some capital with the Macatawa acquisition. They had a lot of excess
capital and not a lot of marks in their portfolio. So, that was beneficial to our capital ratios. Like we've said in the
past, we're in a position now where we think our earnings support our mid- to high-single digit loan growth, so we
should build capital steadily going forward, assuming we don't have outsized growth. And I guess that would be a
good problem to have if you had it.
So we would expect that to continue to just grow and you probably get it. So, your – our CET1 is close to 10%
now, and it would get into the 10% range sometime during 2025. And then for the preferreds, we'll just have to
see what the market is like at that time. Most likely refinance them out at a lower spread, but there's a lot of time
between now and then, so we'll see what happens. But we have our eye on that, and we can either swap them
out, pay some of them down, or make it – well, we'll have to make a decision at the time based upon what market
conditions and rates are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, perfect. And then maybe a couple of housekeeping on the average share count for the fourth quarter and
then the tax rate there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think the tax rate this quarter is pretty clean, so you probably do that. Macatawa added 4.7 million shares
to the total, and we [ph] went ahead (00:37:08) two-thirds of the quarter for that. So, you can just do the math on
that.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon Rud Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just maybe a couple of modeling questions. Kind of
following up on the expense question earlier, I heard the mid-single digit comment. Maybe just more of a medium
– excuse me, a medium or longer-term target for expenses. I think, historically you've looked at the net overhead
ratio. And David, you mentioned that expenses to average assets, do you have maybe a target you can maybe
share for us and where you like that – either of those ratios to settle out over the medium term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, well, it's hard to do a target on that unless you know what the mortgage business is, because when the
mortgage business is really strong, that number – the net overhead ratio comes down. We certainly would like it
less than 150 basis points to grow into there for the net overhead ratio. And then we just sort of expect to get
continued operating leverage. But I don't think we have a long-term goal that we've pointed out there. There are
certain things in the operating expenses like lease – that lease depreciation expense. We hope that goes up,
because the leasing income goes up on the non-interest income side.
So, I think we tend to focus for the net overhead ratio more than the expense ratio, because some of our non-
interest income categories, like Wealth Management and mortgages bring a lot of commissions with them. And
we'd like those businesses to grow, but they bring with them operating expenses, too. So, we sort of like to look at
it as the net overhead ratio, which incorporates both the non-interest income and non-interest expense, rather
than to have a specific non-interest expense target. And our growth on the non-interest expenses, that's sort of
what we've said the last two years and we would expect just to continue at that pace. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon Rud Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you for that. And maybe just my last one. On the mid- to high-single digit loan growth, I'm sorry if you
said this, but where are those incremental yields coming on at? Or maybe a spread of the SOFR or something?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It really depends on, again, we have these different asset categories, so I mean they can range all over. I mean,
the opportunities that are going to be more mid-market deposit heavy, spreads will be in the low-200 range, but
on the P&C side, we're going to get substantially more than that. And everything else is kind of in between. We
continue to be, as we talked about, very, very focused on getting appropriately paid for the risk. And so far, we've
been able to hold the line pretty well on pricing.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw of Barclays.
Your line is open, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Yeah, I think just the last thing I had was the impact of the hedges to margin going forward. I think it
was 17 basis points in this quarter. What's the ballpark that we should expect going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think sort of the rule of thumb generally, Jared, is for every 25 basis points of a reduction in SOFR, we should
benefit by about 2.5 basis points. A little bit of timing difference because some of these reset at the beginning of
the month, et cetera, versus, the daily. But I think we're 17 basis point drag in the third quarter and it should be
less than that if SOFR goes down. But if you sort of use it – and we give all the detail on the slides, but right now,
the average is about 2.5 basis points per 25 basis point-type benefit.

Timothy S. Crane A

Good morning, Nate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I apologize, I've got on a little late. But just in terms of the gain on sale margin compression that we saw this
quarter, it was a little bit more so than what we saw from some other larger banks that reported last week. So, just
curious if you have any thoughts on maybe a starting point for 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, it was a little lower than we'd hoped. But the little volatility when rates were falling and some of the
secondary market hedging that we do at – when we do locks on those, we would expect that the gain on sale
margins would be closer to the 2% range in the fourth quarter. Probably volumes are somewhat similar. And as
Tim said, the rates backed up a little bit. So, there's just not a lot of activity there. But we would not expect the
gain on sale margin to be that low in the fourth quarter. We would expect it to pop back up in closer to 2%.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. Very helpful. Thanks, Dave. And again, I apologize if you already touched on it, but in terms of NII
growth expectations, I know it's kind of a fluid environment in terms of thinking about next year. But assuming the
margin kind of holds in around 3.50%, even if we get another 100 basis points of Fed cuts next year, just any
thoughts on just how much NII can grow, assuming balance sheet growth remains at the mid- to high-single digit
range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I guess, it's just math that right, if we think the margin is going to be relatively stable and you have mid- to
high-single digit asset growth, you'd have the mid- to high-single digit NII. So, that's the way we look at it, as
relatively stable margin and mid- to high single digit earning asset growth, which should produce net NII growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Always helpful just to hear you guys indicate that. And then, just lastly, just in terms of the expected
growth in capital going forward, I think you mentioned you're just going to kind of remain opportunistic on the M&A
front going forward. But just, any other thoughts on just how you'd like to manage capital? Are you guys just
comfortable kind of building excess capital over the next several quarters here in light of the preferred reset next
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, as Dave said, Nate, we'll look at the preferred options that exist as we get into the summer next
year, but otherwise, absent a lot of loan growth, we should be building capital and are comfortable to kind of
gradually continue to improve the company's capital ratios.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

again, I would just characterize this quarter as solid growth organically, as well as the addition of Macatawa, a
stable margin, which we believe we've positioned the bank well for going forward. Good credit at the moment.
We're knocking on wood as we say that. And then, continued investment in the franchise's future and that's in
technology and building share the markets and hiring the right people. So, we're actually very optimistic going into
