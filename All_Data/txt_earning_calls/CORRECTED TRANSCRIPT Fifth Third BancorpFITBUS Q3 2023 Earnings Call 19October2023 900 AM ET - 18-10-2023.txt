Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President
and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook.
Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston; and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined us in the Q&A portion of
the call.
Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and
presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations
to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements
speak only as of October 19, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared
remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions.
With that, let me turn it over to Tim.

Timothy N. Spence
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they
perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. That is why we focus on
stability, profitability, and growth, in that order. It is also why I am so pleased that our key return and profitability
metrics remain resilient despite the market-related headwinds that all banks are facing.
Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.92 excluding a $0.01 impact from our Visa swap,
reflecting strong PPNR results and favorable credit outcomes. We generated an adjusted return on tangible
common equity ex AOCI of nearly 16%, which increased 50 basis points sequentially, and a return on assets of
1.26%. We generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter, supported by a more diverse range of
fee income streams than peers, and our investments in treasury management, capital markets, and wealth
management.
Our third quarter total non-interest expense increased less than 2% compared to the year ago quarter, and we
generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%. In the last four years, we have managed expenses to the
lowest growth rate among peers, despite also investing in growth by building more new branches, raising our
minimum wage, modernizing our technology platforms, and acquiring four fintech companies. Expense
management at Fifth Third is a continuous process and not a program. Since March of this year, full-time
equivalent employee head count is down 3.5%.

Turning to the balance sheet, we generated 4% average deposit growth compared to the year-ago quarter versus
a 5% decline for the industry. New relationship growth remained strong. Consumer households grew more than
2%, led by 6% growth in the Southeast, a continuation of our multi-year growth pace. New middle market
relationships added year-to-date remain 25% ahead of last year's record pace.
Thanks to the release of the annual FDIC Summary of Deposits, the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to
understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis. This year, Fifth Third maintained
or improved our market rank in every single one of our 40 largest MSAs. In the Midwest, we maintained our
number two overall position behind JPMorgan Chase. In the Southeast, where we are just four years removed
from opening our first NextGen branch, we have reached or are approaching target locational share in 8 of our
original 11 focus markets.
We intend to continue to open approximately 35 branches per year through 2028, at which time nearly 50% of our
branches will be in Southeast markets. These market share gains are the by-product of multi-year strategies that
are not easily replicable by competitors. They include innovative operational deposit-oriented products like
Momentum Banking, AI-driven customer acquisition strategies, and a top quartile customer service model, in
addition to our investments in new branches.
Our key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were in line with our July expectations,
and both early-stage delinquencies and non-performing assets improved sequentially. The ACL increased 3 basis
points given slight changes to Moodys' macroeconomic forecast.
Turning to liquidity and capital. We made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes
in the regulatory framework. Our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with $103
billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full Category I LCR compliance at the end of both August and
September.
During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our RWA optimization initiative. Total RWA declined 1%
compared to the prior quarter. Our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter, so we can return
to growing loans next year. We accreted over 30 basis points of CET1 capital during the quarter, reflecting our
strong earnings power, while we also raised our quarterly dividend by 6%.
With respect to the economy, while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market
sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing, we continue to be more cautious given concerning signals
disguised beneath the aggregates. For example, while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong,
most, if not all of the job growth is a by-product of more people working part-time jobs. Real average weekly
earnings slipped every month during the quarter, and the lower-end of the consumer spectrum now maintains
deposit balances below pre-COVID levels. Anecdotally, the last time Google searches for soft landing were this
high was in May of 2008.
Before I turn it over, I want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers,
strengthen our communities, and support one another. Your efforts are why Time Magazine recently recognized
Fifth Third as one of the World's Best Companies, and why I am as confident as ever in Fifth Third's ability to
outperform through-the-cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders.
With that, Jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook.

James C. Leonard
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were once again strong despite
the market headwinds. We continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations
while also managing our business very efficiently. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%, reflecting
ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee
revenue streams.
Net interest income of approximately $1.45 billion decreased 1% sequentially. Our NII and NIM results reflect our
proactive and continued defensive positioning, given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our
short-term investments, which primarily represent our cash held at the Fed increased $5 billion on an average
basis and increased $8 billion on an end-of-period basis to $19 billion. This increased level of cash was the
primary driver of our 12-basis-point NIM decline.
Adjusted non-interest income increased 1% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in capital
markets and deposit service charge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily
by lower origination volumes. Our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has
become a key distinction for Fifth Third compared to many peers. Adjusted non-interest expense increased just
2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy, and
technology expenses, partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially due to
softening customer demand and our RWA optimization efforts. Average C&I balances decreased 2% sequentially.
As Tim mentioned, clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans. Consequently, production was
muted in corporate banking. Also, average CRE balances decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter. The
period end commercial revolver utilization rate of 36% increased 1% compared to last quarter, partially due to our
exit of certain lower-returning unused commercial commitments.
On a sequential basis, total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased 3% and 4%,
respectively, while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased 5% and 7%,
respectively. This trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle
market. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased 1% sequentially due to our
intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate
environment, partially offset by growth from Dividend Finance.
Our card balances increased just 1% this quarter, reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on
transactors. Balances have increased 3% relative to the year ago quarter, compared to 11% for the industry.
Average total deposits increased 3% sequentially as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were
partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mix-shift we have seen for several quarters.
DDAs as a percent of core deposits were 28% for the quarter, compared to 30% in the prior quarter. The 2-point
decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that Tim highlighted from our net new
relationship growth in both consumer and commercial, which are obviously skewed to interest-bearing products in
this environment. As a result, we added more than $4 billion in core deposits during the quarter, the most since
the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the DDA migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter
and marked the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, and commercial deposits increased 4%,
while wealth and asset management deposits declined 2%, reflecting clients' alternative investment options. As a
result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits, we achieved a loan-to-core deposit ratio
of 74% at quarter-end, which should be one of the best, if not the best, compared to our regional peers. We also
achieved full Category I LCR compliance at 118% at quarter-end.
Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit has remained resilient. The net charge-off ratio of 41 basis points
increased 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected, reflecting two credits which had been
fully reserved. Early-stage delinquencies decreased 7% compared to the prior quarter, while loans 90 days past
due of just 2 basis points were a record low for Fifth Third.
Non-performing loans decreased 9%. This quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial NPLs since the
second quarter of 2022. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the
granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality
relationships. As many of you know, we tightened underwriting standards during COVID, which limited our growth
but improved the stability of our balance sheet.
In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary
pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest
overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Our criticized, non-
performing, and delinquent CRE loans have all improved sequentially and remain very well-behaved.
And within that, the same is true for our office exposures. For instance, criticized office loans represented just
5.4% of total office CRE, which improved 180 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we have zero delinquencies
and zero charge-offs. We also decreased loan balances by 8% in the office book without any loan sales. These
credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers' who have reported their office exposures so far this
quarter. While credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong and we continue to believe the overall
impact on Fifth Third will be limited, we nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment.
Our Shared National Credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective, with criticized
assets, non-performing loans, and net charge-offs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across
a multi-year period. Our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture. We continue to closely monitor all
exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio, as well as the fall-out
from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector, where we think our exposures are very
manageable.
Moving to the ACL. Our reserves decreased $5 million but the coverage ratio increased 3 basis points
sequentially to 2.11% as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case
economic outlook. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our
allowance. Both the Moody's base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter ACL assume a
slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter. We maintained our scenario weightings
of 80% to the base and 10% to each the upside and downside scenarios.
Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 31 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 9.8%. Our capital
position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation, combined with the
impact of our RWA diet. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 10% compared to the year
ago quarter. We continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses, resulting in approximately
6

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
35% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately two-thirds by
2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.
Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiative and our
continued deferment of share buybacks. We anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year
above 10%.
Moving to our current outlook. We expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline 2% to 3%
sequentially, with consumer loans down 2% and commercial loans down 3%. This reflects our overall cautious
economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our RWA diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk-
adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments.
We expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Within that, we expect core deposits to
increase 1% due to our multi-year investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial
relationships, along with the benefit from seasonality. While we continue to expect modest migration from DDA
into interest-bearing products in a higher-for-longer interest rate environment, specifically for the fourth quarter,
we expect the mix of DDA to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits.
Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter NII to be down approximately 1% to 2% sequentially
due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. Our NII guidance assumes no
additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta, which includes CDs and excludes DDAs of 55% by the fourth quarter.
Excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding, given the
pricing considerations, our cumulative beta expectation continues to be 53%. This outlook translates to total
interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 15 to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year end. As a
byproduct of our strong deposit growth, combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances, we expect
to hold closer to $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year end. Given these balance trends, we expect our
loan-to-core deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year, which will keep Fifth Third in a
strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements, including remaining compliant
with the full Category 1 LCR.
We expect fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income to increase 1% to 2% compared to the third quarter. We
expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions, driven by our multi-year focus on growing a diverse
portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments.
We expect fourth quarter TRA revenue of $22 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We
expect fourth quarter adjusted non-interest expenses to be stable to up 1%, compared to the third quarter. Our
guidance excludes the pending FDIC special assessment, which we currently estimate at $208 million for Fifth
Third.
With respect to credit quality, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be 30 to 35 basis points. We do expect
to gradually normalize from here. We continue to believe that our through-the-cycle annual charge-offs will be in
the 35- to 45-basis-point range, given the credit risk profile of the bank.
Given our reduced loan outlook, we expect the change in the ACL for the fourth quarter to be stable to up $25
million, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers
7

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
production from Dividend Finance of around $700 million in the fourth quarter, which as you know, carries a
higher reserve level of around 9%.
In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management, and commitment
to delivering strong performance through-the-cycle, we believe we are well-positioned to meet the proposed
regulatory requirements while continuing to generate long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Doll
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one
question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open
the call up for Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Jamie, I was hoping you – maybe you can – could expand
even a little more on your thoughts on bringing in so many deposits in the third quarter. I know you're trying to get
your liquidity to a certain very high level and you achieved it. But it was just a kind of astonishing number, so just
curious as to what the thinking throughout the quarter was. I guess, the additional forward-look, though, you
provided some of the deposit commentary or expectations in there. But just any additional thoughts would be
helpful, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, Scott, for the question. We were certainly ringing the victory bell on deposits this quarter. Really,
when you take a look back, coming out of March madness, one the biggest drivers of our deposit success in the
second quarter and the third quarter was really transitioning our customer recommendation engine from
household growth to deposit growth. And while that sacrificed a little bit on the household growth numbers instead
of our typical up 3% or up 4%, we were 2% on households, but that translated to very strong consumer deposit
growth. And so, within the deposit growth we did have during the quarter of almost $4.8 billion, about 60% was
commercial, 40% was consumer; and within consumer, 70% of that growth was in the Southeast markets, while
30% of that growth was in the Midwest.
So again, the retail franchise at Fifth Third is just performing at an extremely high level. And on the commercial
side, the growth was surprisingly high, given the corporate banking book growth within the commercial deposit
growth; about 80% of the growth was in corporate banking. So, at that time, we were targeting let's get LCR – full
LCR north of 100%. We actually came in at 118%, so definitely did better than we initially expected. But when we
were dissecting the quarter end results, it really makes sense that the corporate banking book did better. And as
8

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
one of the sort of hidden benefits of the RWA diet, is that we're getting better share of wallet within that corporate
banking book, and that also helped drive the deposit growth.
So, overall, a very strong quarter. Again, for us on the deposit side, we expect continued growth in the fourth
quarter, albeit at a little bit lower growth rate, but still up a bit in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. All right. That's very helpful, and thank you. And then, if I could switch gears for just a second. The
securities portfolio marks, I guess, you all might come out looking a little heavier than some others, but by the
same token, you guys have been more hesitant to use the HTM classification as well. I guess, just any updated
thoughts on sort of how you're thinking about that, at least optically, would help out levels, if not, in terms of real
world. But just curious to hear your updated thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. If you break it down between real world and regulatory world, that's really how we are looking at this. In the
real world, with really the economic risk, whenever you have a fixed rate asset, whether that's in AFS, HTM or in
the loan portfolio, you have that economic risk to higher rates. We have elected to hold our securities in AFS and
we'll continue to do so, given that it gives us better flexibility and opportunity to reposition as the environment
changes.
But when you are in the real world managing the balance sheet, how we approach balance sheet management is
in totality. And you can look at our strong NII results, our interest-bearing liability results, any of the measures
relative to peers, the total balance sheet is performing very well. We're going to grow NII this year, 3% to 5%.
Others are shrinking. So, our philosophy is paying off in the real world.
The challenge simply comes from the fair value of a single line item and putting that into capital. We're not
insensitive to how that looks on the face of the balance sheet and the tangible book value per share, but we still
believe it is prudent to have that flexibility because flexibility has value. In terms of the regulatory risk, perhaps
one of the details that we continue to evaluate is something we've not really communicated to all of you externally,
is that, given the burn down that you have in the presentation and in the significant – whether it's static rate,
forward rate, you're looking at 60%, 65% of the AOCI burn down during the transition into the new capital
regimes, assuming the rules play out as currently written.
And that burn down is going to happen on our portfolio because our portfolio has structure. We have defined
maturities, unlike those portfolios that are in residential mortgage-backed instruments with convexity and
extension risk, we know our portfolio is going to pay down. And we know that this is going to be very manageable
from a regulatory capital perspective.
When we model the capital impact at a fully phased-in level on AOCI, the impact on CET1 is about 125 basis
points when you reach the third quarter of 2028, and that's why we continue to accrete CET1, is to be able to
have sufficient regulatory capital for that world. And in fact, should rates get north of 8%, we would still be
maintaining a CET1 well-above regulatory minimums, we'd be over 8% CET1 in that environment.
So, we feel good about how we're positioned, how we will roll down the curve. And ultimately, the regulatory
capital, it's just one of the challenges in this environment with everything in AFS is that you have that mark on the
9


Fifth Third Bancorp

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
tangible book value per share, that erosion. But at the same time, should rates fall, I think all of you would be very
pleased with how much tangible book value accretion we would report in that environment.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Scott, if I just put a point on the last thing Jamie said. I mean, we believe investors want us to do what is best for
managing the business and for recognizing the fact that options have value. But if you believe that the AOCI mark
is weighing on the stock, then the other way to look at it is the burn down is 25% accretion in tangible book value
per share in the next two years. Just given that current outlook on rates, which is a pretty unique buying
opportunity, would be the other way to look at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, I agree. All right. That's perfect. So, Tim and Jamie, thank you both.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Jamie, this first one is for you. Not to belabor the earlier point, but all the PPNR metrics and balance sheet
metrics look great and so did the forward look. And I guess, if you could just explain what happened in the
quarter, I think given that your portfolio – your securities portfolio is 61% CMBS, I think investors that know you
well expected not as much negative convexity. Was there something unique that happened in this quarter in the
portfolio that – where the AOCI was that much wider?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Not really. It was a pretty vanilla quarter for us where we had cash flows in the quarter of about $500 million. We
put about $700 million to work of the excess cash in short-duration Level 1s Treasury floaters. When you look at
10

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
the AOCI walk that happened in the quarter, the securities portfolio, because everything is in AFS, worsened
about $1.2 billion. And if you look at how the five-year moved – increased about 45 basis points, the 10-year
moved about 75 bps, and then spreads widened 5 bps on the CMBS and about 15 bps in mortgage. So, when
you add it all up with the DV01 of about $25 million, that gets you to the AOCI movement for the quarter on the
investment portfolio. And so, it was in line at least with our expectations with how rates were moving during the
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my follow-up question was for you, Tim. I think it was a very powerful statement you said in the
beginning of the call in terms of confidence that you could return to loan growth next year. I think several of your
peers that have similar CET1 ratios and similar AOCI marks are still talking about dieting. Could you give us a
sense of, first of all, if you could confirm what the AOCI was in basis points, Jamie? And second, Tim, how are
you balancing, on one hand, the market wants you to continue to build capital as we approach that transitional
date on CET1; and on the other, we're still hearing low demand from corporates for financing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So, there's a lot in there. But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I don't have one more question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
But that's the right question, Erika. So, a few things here. One, I think we have tried to be consistent in how we
confront change or a need for change in how we operate the company. And the underlying principle here is that, if
you have to make a change, it's better to do it quickly so that you can get it behind you and return to a normal
mode of operations.
So, we have been aggressive at building liquidity. Jamie talked about the fact that we were Cat I LCR compliant in
both August and September this year. And I think, equivalently, we have tried to be very proactive about how we
manage through the RWA diet. So we have one additional quarter to go of dieting to hit our RWA target, which
was about a 2% reduction. If you just look at what we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And from there, we'll have
achieved what we think we need to achieve in order to be able to refocus on growing the balance sheet prudently,
I should say, growing the loan portfolio prudently, sequentially over the course of the next year.
We have benefit of a very high level of profitability right now, right. We obviously don't have all of the peer reports
at this point. But if you look at the core profitability measures here, they're excellent. We're generating 30-plus
basis points of CET1 a quarter, which is quite helpful, as it relates to being able to both build capital and fund loan
growth.
And then while demand is tepid, across the sector. We have some idiosyncratic benefits here that probably have
been a little bit lost behind the diet in the form of both Dividend and Provide, which continue to perform very well
and generate growth; and the sustained multi-year investment we've made in expanding our middle market
11

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
coverage in the Southeast markets, right. The middle market relationships are – in terms of the new relationships
we've added to the company year-to-date, are 25% ahead of our all-time record pace.
And we still have bankers who are seasoning in – in terms of building their portfolios that we have been fortunate
to hire over the course of the past few years. So, those are the things that really provide the catalyst in an
environment where demand, in aggregate, is a little bit more tepid, and then the raw capacity in the form of capital
generation to be able to support that statement that we can return to growth next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And then, Erika, on your other components of the question, CET1 for us finished the quarter at 9.8%. Excluding
the investment portfolio, AOCI, that number would be 6.3%. And then, the RWA bloat from the pending rules
would be about 2% to 3% of RWA, which is about 20 basis points. So, we would look to be at a 6.1% level.
But as we talked about then, the earnings power of the company is very strong. We continue to defer the
buybacks. We'll continue to accrete capital. And with the passage of time, given the structure in the investment
portfolio, the burn down of that AOCI will be 65% or so by the time we reach the fully phased-in level. So, we feel
that this is a very manageable timeline for the company. In fact, have a lot of cushion should rates even go higher.

Tim, coming back to your opening comments about your corporate and commercial customers being cautious and
you yourself seeing some of the economic crosswinds or crosscurrents being cautious. I noticed yesterday that
the real GDP number that the Atlanta Fed puts out for the third quarter is calling for a 5.4% real GDP growth in
the third quarter. It's probably too high. But the point is, there are a lot of crosscurrents.
Can you share with us, when you talk to your customers, what do you think is going to take them to become more
optimistic and less cautious? Is it a Fed halting in increasing short-term interest rates? Is it better inflation
numbers? What do you think they're waiting for before they really start committing to borrowing more money and
growing their businesses?

Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, that's a great question, Gerard. Yeah, I think, honestly, it's less uncertainty, right, so, to your point. So, you
have a lot of variables underway here. You have the Fed and rates, as you mentioned. You have an immense
amount of government spending right now, which is propping up economic growth in certain sectors of the
economy that otherwise wouldn't be there. You have sort of unusual times in the housing market where we have
both high rates and still stable, or even in some markets slightly growing home prices, even though home
affordability is at an all-time low.
And it's just, I think, more than anything else, we need to see some of those variables get fixed, right, in terms of
what happens. So, if the Fed stops raising rates and then introduces a cut, I think that would be helpful. I think
that we have to see the last of the stimulus dollars come out of consumer accounts and see what the floor looks
like in terms of consumer spending. And then, I think we have to have a better sense for what the underlying
economic activity looks like in areas where the government spending, the $2 trillion that are coming out of the
various government programs, are not driving a lot of the economic activity for people to get a little bit more
focused.
Because again, what I hear and I went out and I had the opportunity to get feedback from about three dozen
clients shortly before the call here, is they're seeing a gradual slowdown that is essentially disposable income.
They're seeing disparities on the consumer side between either businesses or take hotels; hotel properties that
either cater to retired people or to high-end consumers in high-end destinations continue to do well, whereas the
mass market properties are starting to soften. We hear them on the B2B side being much more guarded as it
relates to liquidity and monitoring cash and adjusting staffing levels and just delaying the larger CapEx
investments here.
And I think an interesting data point, as I had the chance to spend a little bit of time with the head of economic
development for one of the large states in our footprint, and I was asking about the new project pipeline. Said, "Oh
yeah, pipeline's still robust, there's a lot of discussion going on, but the time to decision from when they're initially
contacted about a potential opportunity for either a new plant or a headquarter relocation or otherwise to the
award in a given state has moved from 200 days as recently as 18 months ago to over 500 days." So, you can
just see the grind down here of economic activity as people sit on the sidelines and wait to get a better sense for
what direction we're headed in the economy.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you, Tim. Very insightful. And then, on credit, tying in into maybe the economic comments that you just
made – and I don't know if this is for Greg and Jamie – but can you share with us – Jamie, you showed some very
strong credit numbers in your prepared remarks. And can you just tell us, is it better underwriting, if you look back
to the financial crisis, through-the-cycle net charge-off ratio, I guess, it's quite a bit higher than what you're
thinking today.
And then second, is it also – your customers, because of the pandemic and what they went through, are they just
better managed today from a balance sheet perspective than was the case pre-financial crisis?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Yes. It's Greg. It's a great question. I think it's all of the above, right. I think we have been very disciplined, very
fundamental about our through-the-cycle underwriting for the past several years. We've been very disciplined
around our concentration in this, geographically or by product, right. So, we have a very well-diversified portfolio.
As a result, we're not seeing trending one way or the other. So, we've just been disciplined around that. We've
been disciplined around ongoing portfolio management, right. So, we are proactive. We're getting out ahead of
issues when they arise. We are stress-testing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve – forward-looking yield
curve. And we've seen through other cycles, to the extent we get out ahead of this and we identify issues earlier,
we minimize.
We also have the ability then to bring solutions to our clients, right, to help them through some of these cycles.
And so, we're seeing all of that across the board, be it in our commercial real estate portfolio, very diverse. We
weren't as aggressive in that portfolio as some other banks were when rates were 550 basis points lower, and the
same thing through our C&I book. So, it's fundamental, sticking to those fundamentals, staying disciplined, both
on the front-end underwriting, client selection, and then staying on top of the portfolio.

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I guess, maybe just following up on Gerard's question around the macro and credit. Tim, just
if you can add to your comments, there's still some concern that we could hit a recession first half of next year,
could drive significant deterioration in credit quality.
One, how much of a visibility do you have into credit change over the next few quarters where you can safely say
that's unlikely? And maybe, Jamie, just talk to us about the ability of the CECL model to capture that kind of
deterioration ahead of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So, good morning, Ebrahim. It's good to chat. I think a couple of comments. So, narrowly to your point, I
think we have fairly good visibility into what the first half of year is going to look like and we're not seeing anything
at the moment that would suggest that we're headed toward credit deterioration in the first half, right, we talked
about it in the script. Delinquency formation – delinquency rates are actually down on the early-stage basis. NPAs
are down sequentially. And we have a roll-forward for you in the appendix, the slides which would indicate that
that trend is likely to continue through the fourth quarter.
And on the consumer side, just as an example, the nice thing about the way that we manage delinquencies is it's
like an assembly line. So, you can see in the 0 to 29 and then the 30-plus days buckets what you're going to be
dealing with early next year, and there just isn't anything in there to be worried about. With that said, the base
case we're using as we think about the management of the company, strategic investments, how we manage
14

expenses and otherwise, continues to assume that maybe the market is a little bit too bullish on the idea of a soft
landing here.
I mean, again, you just look at the payroll numbers, so – and apply a human lens to it. So, jobs are up but job
participation is flat, labor force participation is flat, and average hours worked are down and unemployment's
stable. What that means is you have more people working two jobs because they're not getting enough hours or
earning enough money at the job that they were working – the base job that they were working to be able cover
their expenses.
So, when you then look at declining real incomes, the only thing that really would be standing between somebody
who is having to work two jobs and is still suffering from a declining real income and credit delinquency is the fact
that there was the stimulus buffer that built up because people had forbearance on loan portfolios and stimulus
dollars. Well, the student loans are back now. Housing inflation is still very high at 7.2%, I think, in the most recent
prints. And those are just early indicators that that there are people across the country that are struggling a lot
more than the headline numbers would suggest.
So, I feel good because the two areas I would say the market's most worried about right now are subprime
consumers and renters where we have very little in the way of exposure on the – virtually no subprime, and I think
the lowest level there of any of our peers who provide information on that front, and 85% of the consumer
exposure is to homeowners.
And then, in commercial real estate, where, again, the – our exposure relative to total capital is lower than
anybody else's. And because we weren't trying to grow that portfolio materially, we're able to be much more
selective, which is reflected in superior credit metrics right now when you look at our commercial real estate book
relative to others. So, it's both smaller and better performing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And in terms of how the consumer is doing and what we see in our data, the average consumer balance is
still – deposit balance is still 15% above pre-COVID levels. But to Tim's point, renters are back to pre-COVID
levels and sub-660 FICO's are actually below pre-COVID levels. So, the averages can be a little bit misleading in
terms of what credit outcomes may bring in 2024. But as Tim said, we're certainly well-positioned from a credit
perspective on our balance sheet.
And from an ACL perspective, on the second part of your question, the scenarios we use from Moody's have GDP
contracting almost near zero. So, the modeling certainly picks up erosion in the forecast. In this quarter, you had a
slight erosion, both in GDP and unemployment, as well as with corporate profits; and that was part of the reason
or the primary reason why our ACL coverage increased from 208 basis points to 211 basis points. It's just we had
the benefits of the loan balance reduction and the unused commitment reductions from the RWA optimization
efforts that offset that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Well, that's helpful. And just a separate question. In terms of deposit pricing, as we look through next year and if
rates don't get cut in higher-for-longer, are you observing any differences within your geographies Midwest versus
Southeast? Clearly, you're opening a lot of branches in the Southeast so you have a different strategy there, I
assume, relative to the home market. Just give us a sense of pricing competition, any differences? And in your
15

view, is deposit pricing now essentially natural in nature or is it still localized where certain markets could
meaningfully outperform or lag in – on the repricing side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, excellent question. I'll start and then turn it over to Bryan. In terms of total deposit costs and deposit pricing,
the quarter played out as expected with our beta ticking up from a total deposits excluding brokered to 50%. We
expect that to hit the 53% beta we talked about a quarter or two ago. So, the pricing is playing out as we have
expected, and I think most of the bank's beta guides are coming up to where we've been at this higher-for-longer
scenario. But in terms of each geography, Bryan, you want to touch on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. In general, I think what we're seeing is that it's a combination of – it is local and
a national impact right now. And what you're seeing is that you may have periods of time where the dominant
players or the bigger players in specific markets may just have a lower liquidity need, and so that gives you a little
bit of an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and do well from a share perspective. But what we've seen
since March is that tends to rotate around a little bit.
And ultimately, as people start to realize as deposit competition is moving in the market, you're just seeing people
then start to react. Your most rate-sensitive customers are absolutely focused on the national markets. They tend
to be the ones that are most willing to use a non-traditional provider, and so you definitely see some of that. But in
general, it tends to – you still tend to have some opportunity to take advantage of some geographic differences,
but those geographic differences can rotate over time.

getting to that NII bottoming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. The first quarter, the day count is what will drive that NII trough. The NIM, whether it's the fourth quarter or
the first quarter, is going to be driven solely by how much excess cash we have from the strong deposit
performance. So, we'll see, but it's going to be one of those two quarters.

Okay, got it. And then, as you think forward, how do we understand the benefit that you'll get once rates get to a
peak about fixed rate loan repricing? I think it's clear to understand how the securities book moves. But on the
loan side, can you walk us through just how much benefit you might be able to see as we get into next year from
that side being able to offset any lagging deposit pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. The consumer book in particular is where most of the fixed rate repricing benefit resides. If you look at
2024, we'll have about $8 billion of consumer loan pay-offs, is how we model it. And front book rates are 200 to
300 basis points higher than back book rates. And so, if you take that, coupled with, call it, $4 billion in security
maturities and cash flows, you end up with about $300 million tailwind on an annualized basis. Obviously, that'll
happen during the course of 2024, so take half of that for the in-year effect. But you're looking at $300 million type
of run rate benefit just from one year's repricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. If I could just ask one last one. The – your – the swap slide you have just talks about the 2025
versus 2023 update. Is there anything different or any thought process different about some other banks have
been adding securities-based swaps to protect capital and add a little variable rate juice? Have you done anything
like that incrementally or is that slide looks pretty intact in terms of how you're approaching swap portfolios of both
loans and securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, we've done nothing incremental at this point. Obviously, we're paying attention to the market and
evaluating opportunities. I think more than anything, the – as Jamie mentioned, the goal of locked out structure of
our portfolio ultimately is our hedge to higher rates right now, because we now have those defined maturities that
are going to come in and we think that keeps us relatively well-positioned, but we're constantly keeping an eye on
the market and figuring out if there are opportunities for us to continue to improve our positioning.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I guess, this goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, your efficiency ratio of 55%, do you think
that can improve next year, which is another way of saying, is there any shot at getting positive operating
leverage? And when I give the positives and negatives, and correct me, it looks like from the negatives, the RWA
diet certainly helps capital but has a cost to NII. And I think you mentioned NII not bottoming maybe until first,
second quarter. You have the cumulative beta going up to 53%. It's in line, but still going higher. You're opening
35 new branches a year.
17


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
On the other hand, your RWA diet will end and maybe you can lean into the balance sheet more. You mentioned
the deposits, the smallest DDA increase since March. The excess cash, which you could choose to put to work,
so really part of the tailwind is the asset beta relative to the deposit beta. So, does your efficiency improve next
year? Can you get positive operating leverage? Is that too much of a stretch? How do you think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think it'll be environment dependent, which I'm sure is not the answer you wanted. But I think you hit on all
the right points, Mike, which is, the RWA diet makes positive operating leverage difficult in 2024. With that said,
we will do everything in our power to deliver as good of results as we can, but I think it'll be a challenge in 2024.

And just clarification on the credit side. Did I hear you correctly, you have zero office delinquencies, zero office
charge-offs; commercial, you have the lowest inflows to NPA since 2Q 2022. You reiterated 35 to 45 basis points
through-the-cycle. Is that correct? And I know it's been asked already, but you're saying the economy is grinding
lower, doesn't look good. So, would you just say your credit's economically insensitive at this point? I mean, that's
like – don't you think you could maybe be wrong if things don't go so well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Until you got to the last part there, I was going to say, in a word, yes. But then, you made the question a little
more complicated. You want to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. All of those facts are correct, and we feel very good about all of the work we've done on the credit portfolio
over the last 15 years. In terms of it being economically insensitive, no. But within any industry, there are going to
be winners and losers, and that's where it comes down to that client selection that Greg referenced.
We just believe we are very well-positioned, and we've been very diligent. And part of the benefit that we're
getting right now is the fact that we were not stretching for loan growth over the past several years and have
probably had the lowest loan growth guides over the past several years running. And so, back to our priorities of
stability and profitability ahead of growth.

Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning, guys. Just on the credit side, I know you mentioned that the new NPA inflows were the lowest
since the second quarter of 2022, excluding the large charged-off items, I guess. Could you maybe talk about the
sustainability of that? What are you seeing in terms of risk migration and some of your internal risk ratings and
everything that – do you think the inflows are likely to remain that low at this point? And what's the driver of the
pressure? Is it the areas everybody suspects in terms of CRE or is it more on the C&I side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Schroeck A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Not on the CRE side, great question. Not on the CRE side, we're not seeing. It doesn't mean we're out of the
woods yet. We're watching that portfolio. Clearly, there's stress in that portfolio, but we have so little of it, that's
not driving. And as I said earlier, we don't have any geographic or product trends. There's not an industry that's
driving our NPA numbers as we sit here today. We have very little from a delinquency standpoint. And so, again,
it gets back to how diverse the portfolio is.
Yes, I still think we've got some pressure on the 550-basis-point rate increase that will flow through to our clients.
But we're on top of the portfolio. It's why we're stressing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve. So, we can get
out ahead of that stuff. And so, could it go up a little bit given all the crosscurrents? Sure, but I think we're in a
great, great spot. Our client selection has been outstanding. Our through-the-cycle, very disciplined fundamental
underwriting, I think gets us through this cycle. And so, I feel good about where we are today. And even if it goes
up a little bit, it's very controllable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, great. Thanks. And then, secondly, kind of a two-parter. Do you have – I know you mentioned the criticized
loans are down in total this quarter versus last. Do you have the magnitude of that decline?
And then, on the Shared National Credit side, the portfolio of 29% of loans, I think, over the past year, that maybe
is down a touch. I mean, do you – or do you expect that you're going to reduce the size of the Shared National
Credit book? And also, what is the criticized ratio for that portfolio? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Schroeck A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So, we reduced the – it is about 29%, you're right. We reduced that portfolio by about 7% year-to-date.
Given the dieting that Jamie talked about earlier, I would expect that number to probably continue to decline
between now and year end. Our portfolio, that SNC portfolio performs better than – on every metric than the rest
of the portfolios. So, it's under 6% from a criticized asset standpoint, delinquencies are less than we see in the
rest of the book, NPAs are less. So, it is some of our strongest performing of the portfolio, the commercial
portfolio.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the RWA diet and the trajectory of rates. I guess, does it move into
the 10-year impact how you manage that? So, from here, we get the 10-year moving up 1% or down 1%, does
that impact how you will manage loans? And as we look into next year, what would cause you to maybe lean into
loan growth and what would cause you to peel back? Is it just the outlook on credit, what you're seeing there, or
could the rate outlook impact that as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, thanks. This is Bryan. I would tell you that the outlook on rates has a modest impact on how we think of
loans, but it's more about just composition and more in consumer where we may see some additional opportunity
or in relative asset classes, you might feel a little bit better about some of the spreads in auto, you're going to see
almost no mortgage production in a higher rate environment, obviously. And that's probably the biggest
implication. Just given that our commercial portfolio is primarily floating rate, doesn't really have a big impact from
a floating rate portfolio perspective. And it really, for us, comes down to overall macro, how we feel about what the
credit outlook is going to be, and whether or not we're earning adequate returns on the capital we're deploying.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, just from a cash perspective, it seems like the build was a little bit more than you guided to
before. I think you had said about $15 billion or so on cash is what you were targeting before. I think your target
has now moved to $20 billion. What's driving the change? Is it the volatility in rates? Is it just preparation for LCR?
Or is it also just that you can get 5.5% on cash and makes more sense to hold cash over securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
It was mostly the fact that deposit growth outpaced expectations. And in this environment, we want to hold excess
cash, as opposed to doing anything – adding it to the investment portfolio. We certainly view cash as an asset
allocation at these rates, as you referenced.

So it sounds like, at some point, you'd be able to bring that $20 billion down. It might not be in the next six months
or so, but as rate volatility improves, you might be able to bring that down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I would say that our balance sheet is elevated due to a couple of reasons. One, the unrealized losses,
whether you have it in AFS or HTM, you do have to fund those losses in your liquidity buffers. And so, should
those losses come down, that certainly frees up cash to shrink the sheet or, over time, as our non-HQLA
allocation matures, we will reinvest that in shorter-duration Level 1s and also allow us to maintain an LCR above
100% while also shrinking the sheet. It's just – both of those things are going to be measured more in years than
in quarters in terms of the cash coming down.

Manan Gosalia Q

So, just as a clarification then, does that make you more asset-sensitive, all things equal, now versus, say, last
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
We're pretty neutral right now. How that lines up versus last year, probably a little asset-sensitive a year ago,
whereas today we're neutral to at least in the disclosure showing liability sensitive.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. I know you mentioned a little bit about credit in previous questions. But generally
speaking, is the criticized and classified numbers going to be within a certain band in the next several quarters or
do you see them rising more than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Schroeck A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, I would say steady based on what we're seeing now from the delinquency and NPA, all the above, and
ongoing portfolio. We – in the last 12 months, we have re-rated 95-plus percent of the portfolio. So, based on all
of that underwriting or re-underwriting, if you will, I'm expecting steady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
And if it went higher than you think, that would obviously drive more provisions and obviously more reserve build
next year, just all things being equal. Is that fair?
