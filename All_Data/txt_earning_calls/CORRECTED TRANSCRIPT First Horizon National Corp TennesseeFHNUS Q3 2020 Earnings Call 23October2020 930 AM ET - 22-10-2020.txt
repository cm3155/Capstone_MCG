MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the First Horizon National Corp. Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an

Ellen A. Taylor
Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. To kick things off, our CEO
Bryan Jordan; and CFO BJ Losch, will provide an overview of our results and then we're going to open things up
for question. We're really pleased to have Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit Officer with us to help with that
effort.
So, our remarks today will reference the earnings presentation which is available at ir.fhnc.com, and I should note
that we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the
factors in our SEC filings that may cause our results to differ from our expectations. Our statements reflect our
views today and we aren't obligated to update them. We will also address our adjusted results and our remarks
which are non-GAAP measures and you absolutely should review the GAAP information in our supplement and
on page 2 of our presentation.
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. This has been a very
significant quarter for us. We closed our merger of equals with IBERIABANK. We acquired the 30 branches from
SunTrust, Truist, really excited about that. That integration was done in mid-July.
We've made significant progress during the quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of the
organization, the great work that our associates did to serve their customers and their communities in what has
been a challenging and trying time. We see good momentum in our business. We proved out again the
countercyclical benefit of our businesses, mortgage, mortgage warehouse lending and our fixed income business.
Our balance sheet continues to perform well. As we've talked about over the last 10 or 12 years, we have really
significantly restructured the balance sheet and to focus it more on C&I. We had net charge-offs of 44 basis points
during the quarter and we saw a slight tick up in nonperforming assets, but we ended the period with about $1.3
billion of capacity for loss-taking, so very strong balance sheet.
We had a good quarter in terms of deposit activity. We had good customer inflows and the balance sheet feels
good. And we saw some progress made in adjusting our pricing to compensate for the lower interest rate
environment.

Also, during the quarter, we made good progress on our expenses. We captured another $8 million of run rate in
our quest for $170 million-plus in expense savings. We feel very good about our progress in controlling costs and
our planning for the integration. There's a couple of good slides in the investor deck which you can reference that
lay out the expectations around expense efficiencies over the next couple of quarters and year.
Our capital base continues to be strong. Very, very pleased with the positioning. We came in with a CET1 ratio of
9.15%. Our tangible book value dilution was very slight from the acquisition of the branches and the completion of
the merger, largely offset by earnings during the quarter.
Our planning around the integration continues to go well. We expect that the significant integration work will be
completed by the fall – early fall of 2021. We're on target and on track for completing that integration. We have a
lot of work to do between now and then and we have associates all over the organization who are working to
make sure that we do it in a seamless fashion and minimize, absolutely minimize, adverse impact on our
customers and our communities.
Finally, before I turn it over to BJ, I feel very strongly that we're well-positioned for this somewhat uncertain
environment. Clearly, the progress of the PPP programs, the fiscal stimulus, has been positive to-date on the
economy but there's still uncertainty. I feel like we're well-positioned in terms of a strong balance sheet, strong
loss-taking capacity, strong capital, and also positioned with a tailwind in the sense we have our non – our
countercyclical businesses, and we also have the ability to realize a significant amount of cost savings over the
next 18 to 24 months.
So, with that, I will stop. I'll turn it over to BJ, and then we'd be happy to take questions later. BJ?

William C. Losch III
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
All right. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. If we could turn to slide 5. Our GAAP EPS totaled $0.95 and
$0.35 on an adjusted basis which excludes the pre-tax net notable items detailed here totaling $269 million or
$0.60, which are largely tied to the IBERIA merger. We think it's important to note that the impact of merger
accounting on our financials are overall in line with the estimates we provided to you during the second quarter
call, and then the pro formas released during the quarter. We've provided the detail on the marks and other
impacts related to the merger in the appendix for your review.
On slide 6, we provide a summary of our adjusted financials for the quarter compared with FHN standalone
adjusted results in the prior quarters. So, obviously, the trends here largely reflect the net impact of the IBERIA
merger and the branch acquisition.
Moving on to slide 7 for a look at net interest income and net interest margin, we generated net interest income of
$532 million in the quarter, up $227 million linked quarter driven by the impact of the merger. NII remains fairly
stable with second quarter combined levels despite the impact of the challenging rate environment. Third quarter
results included a $44 million benefit from accretion or about 12 basis points on the NIM, which was modestly
higher than we originally expected given higher prepayments.
Reported NIM came in at $284 million in the quarter, down 6 basis points, reflecting the impact of low rates and
continued elevated levels of liquidity somewhat offset by accretion. We also continue to take action to improve our
deposit pricing profile. Our deposit rate paid was down again this quarter, with interest-bearing deposit cost down
to 36 basis points. Our goal is to manage down interest-bearing deposit cost towards the levels we saw in the
4

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
prior zero interest rate cycle back in 2015 of around 24 basis points. This quarter, we plan to align our deposit
pricing across the expanded franchise which should provide additional benefit as we enter 2021.
Our NIM also continues to reflect the impact of much higher levels of liquidity. We estimate excess cash lowered
the third quarter margin approximately 12 basis points. We averaged about $3 billion of excess cash which grew
to $4.5 billion at quarter end. As you know, while this excess cash position lowers the margin, it does not impact
our net interest income. We continue to look opportunistically for more attractive reinvestment alternatives going
forward and expect to put more of that money to work over time. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see additional
margin pressure likely in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, but expect that level to represent the
bottom for NIM going forward.
Moving on to slide 8 and 9, I would note that here we have provided our results versus prior period combined
results for FHN and IBERIA. We delivered solid performance in fee income again in the third quarter with
relatively stable results on a linked quarter basis, and a 23% year-over-year increase as the benefit of our
countercyclical businesses and fixed income and mortgage banking helped to mitigate COVID-related pressure in
some of our more traditional banking fee income streams.
Fixed income results came in as expected with relatively stable results linked quarter and $33 million increase
year-over-year given average daily revenues of $1.5 million. Mortgage banking again delivered standout results
with a $13 million increase linked quarter and almost $40 million year-over-year. Secondary originations of $1.2
billion were up 3% from strong second quarter levels, while gain on sale margins expanded over 100 basis points
to 3.93%.
As we look into the fourth quarter, while we expect a seasonal slowdown in volumes for both of these businesses,
we do expect overall market conditions to remain favorable for both for the foreseeable future. As you can see on
slide 9, we continue on our commitment to expense discipline. Linked quarter expenses were down $15 million as
the reduction in personnel expense and other non-interest expense was partially offset by an expected increase in
intangibles amortization from the merger and branch acquisition.
Salaries and benefits increased $7 million, driven by the alignment of benefits across the combined platform, the
addition of personnel from the 30 acquired branches and an increase in healthcare costs following the pandemic-
driven slowdown. This increase was more than offset by a reduction in revenue-based incentives and
commissions as well as lower deferred comp costs.
Our results this quarter also reflects the benefit of $8 million in net merger cost saves, giving us a year-to-date
total of $18 million. We understand the importance of remaining incredibly focused on utilizing cost control as a
lever in this environment. We have unique advantages to be able to do so given our merger, and we'll continue to
look for further expense reductions beyond our targeted merger savings.
Turning to slide 13 and 14 (sic) [10 and 11], you see a review of our loan growth and funding profiles relative to
combined First Horizon, IBERIA results. As expected, period end loan growth was modest as customer demand
remains muted, payoffs continue and utilization rates have returned to more normal levels. Bright spot in the
quarter was continued strong mortgage warehouse demand, which drove loans to mortgage companies up $1.6
billion on a spot basis and approximately $430 million on average. Similar to fixed income and mortgage banking
originations, the loans to mortgage companies function as a countercyclical, high return specialty business for us
and we expect continued strong performance.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
On the liability side, period end deposits were up $2.3 billion, driven by the branch acquisition primarily, as well as
continued strong customer inflows, which enabled us to run off higher costs non-customer balances. Given
current levels of excess liquidity and our enhanced market presence, we expect to continue to move our interest-
bearing deposit costs lower particularly as we move to align our pricing strategies across the footprint. We also
further improved our funding profile with $1.2 billion reduction in borrowings from 2Q combined levels as we
leveraged our excess liquidity to pay down legacy IBERIA Federal Home Loan Bank advances.
Starting on slide 12, we'll cover asset quality over the next few slides. Clearly, our results this quarter reflect the
impact of the merger with a lot of moving parts. But if we step back, broadly speaking, overall asset quality
continues to remain fairly benign so far outside of energy despite the impacts of COVID-19. Net charge-offs came
in at 44 basis points, up from 20 basis points for legacy FHN driven by energy-related losses. And we saw a
relatively modest 6 basis point increase in NPL to 75 basis points of total loans despite the impact of the merger.
On slide 13, you see we continue to add reserves this quarter as the impact of the merger and branch acquisition
added $475 million to the allowance for credit losses. Outside of merger math, we also built reserves by a modest
$13 million. Therefore, we ended the quarter with reserves of $1.1 billion which is equivalent to 2.15% of the loan
portfolio excluding the low risk PPP and loans to mortgage companies portfolios and about four times annualized
net charge-offs. When you also factor in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans, we have total loss
absorbing capacity of $1.3 billion or over 2% of total loans.
On slide 14, we provide an update of our view around the portfolios that investors have been most focused on in
terms of impacts from the pandemic. We continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently
affected. And in the quarter we reviewed in detail $9 billion of loans in the commercial portfolio across these
various sectors.
As a result of that, as well as other broader portfolio reviews, we believe that just under 11% of our total loans
should be and are subject to a heightened level of monitoring. We've shown the subsectors of the portfolio that
may be more stressed, such as real estate lending, energy, retail trade, and the non-fast food portion of our
accommodation/food service portfolio. It's important to note that other sectors such as essential services,
recreational goods, manufacturing, and home improvement are continuing to perform well, and additionally, our
higher quality consumer portfolio is performing well as well with a weighted average FICO score of 750 on a
refresh basis.
As we've mentioned to-date, customers are proving to be more resilient than originally feared, and overall, stress
appears to be declining. We provided data in the appendix on the reserve coverage across our portfolio as well as
on deferrals which have now declined meaningfully to around 2.4% of total loan balances from a peak of almost
13%. Overall, we continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and reserve levels, particularly after going
through the very detailed process of marking the IBERIA loan book which represents about 45% of the portfolio.
Moving on to capital and tangible book value per share on slide 15. As we mentioned, TBV per share of $9.92
remained relatively stable in the second quarter as strong earnings were offset by the impact of the IBERIA
merger and the Truist branch acquisition and the CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.15%. Near term, we expect to
continue targeting at CET1 ratio in the 9% to 9.25% range.
Turning to slide 16 for a merger integration update. We continue to be very energized as Bryan said by the
opportunities ahead of us in connection with our merger of equals. In the year since we announced the deal,
we've established a strong merger integration framework to help ensure that we capitalize on the opportunities in
a highly efficient manner even in the face of the pandemic.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
We've already done a great deal to align our cultures, processes and systems to ensure a successful integration.
We've completed much of HR-related integration by identifying leadership and converting payroll systems. And on
the customer side, we built out our go-to-market and organizational models as well as finalizing our customer
experience dashboard. We're on track to convert various other platforms and are currently planning for the full
systems conversion to occur in the fall of 2021.
Again, as Bryan said, in the third quarter, we delivered $8 million of cost savings, bringing the year-to-date total to
$18 million. And in the table on the right, we've provided a modestly updated view of our expected saves over
time. We continue to be highly confident in our ability to deliver at least $170 million of annualized savings in
2022, but the path of the saves has shifted by a quarter or so. This largely reflects the fact that we now believe it's
prudent to target a September-October system conversion versus the previous view of a late second quarter
conversion.
In the table on the right as well, we provided the estimated timing of our merger savings on an annualized basis.
In third quarter 2020, our annualized expense base excluding incentives and commissions totaled about $1.52
billion. And based on our expectations for the timing of the merger saves, we believe that our 2021 expenses
excluding incentives and commissions should reflect the low single digit decrease.
Wrapping up on slide 17, we believe we're well-positioned to capitalize on the benefits of our more diversified
business model over time, and through our IBERIA merger and the branch acquisition, we now have an expanded
franchise across some of the most attractive markets in the South. As we've demonstrated this quarter, we have a
revenue mix that helps us offset NII pressure from the low rate environment. We also have the advantage of
merger cost saves, and through prior acquisitions and efficiency initiatives, we've proven our commitment to
expense controls.
Our prudent approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses going forward, and we have the
benefit of the marked loan book and significant loss absorption capacity. While the economic environment
remains challenging and loan demand is muted, it gives us the ability to focus on merger integration for the next
year. And we believe our business model will result in outperformance and shareholder value creation in the
quarters and years ahead.
Since I know they're listening, I want to give a quick shout out to all those on our various teams across IR,
Accounting, Finance, Credit and Technology in particular that have done extraordinary work and spent long hours
getting us to this point. This is my 47th quarterly earnings call with First Horizon and I've seen a lot over the years,
but the complexity and uniqueness of this quarter and the year take the cake. Thanks to all of you for your efforts.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, BJ. We believe our strong balance sheet capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult operating
environment. We've maintained strong underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on
profitability and performance in a downturn. Despite the economic headwinds, we are uniquely positioned to
capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale, better efficiency and improved earnings power to create
significant shareholder value.

We are incredibly committed to continuing to assist our associates, communities and customers in efforts to
overcome the impact of COVID-19 and revitalize the economy. Thank you to all of our associates for their
outstanding commitment in helping us and helping our company and our communities navigate this
unprecedented landscape. Again, we're very well-positioned. I'm very, very excited about the combination of
IBERIABANK and First Horizon and we think we have unprecedented opportunities ahead of us.
With that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Hi. Good morning, everybody.

Hi, Jared.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Maybe just starting on credit. I guess, first, what's the credit mark specifically on the energy portfolio beyond
just the provision?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. If you – we've got about a seven point – almost 7.5% coverage, allowance coverage for the energy portfolio.
That's detailed on page 19 in the earnings deck.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess in addition to the allowance, what's the [ph] 141-hour (00:22:39) mark on the acquired portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
The mark on the energy portfolio, I'm not sure I have that in front of me in detail. But like Susan said, we had
energy charge-offs in the quarter. We replenished the reserve on a combined basis and the reserve on the energy
portfolio remains at about 7.5%. So, still very healthy reserves.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. For sure. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, it looks like you used the August economic baseline in
calculating the provisioning allowance this quarter. Given that September and October have improved, could we
view this as a high watermark for the allowance ratio assuming all else equal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. It's a great question. I would hope so, but we're hoping for the best but still pretty cautious about what could
occur particularly around the election and entering the fall and what could happen with COVID-19, etcetera. So,
obviously we feel very comfortable with our reserve levels. We feel very comfortable with the marks that we've
made. We continue to take a cautious approach to particularly releasing reserves. You'll see we had just a very
modest build on our reserves despite the fact that, like you said, that the outlook has certainly gotten better from
second quarter and even from the August scenarios that we used. So, we're going to continue to be cautious
about holding on to reserves for a while. But at some point, clearly, you're going to see that if the economy
continues to improve, which we sure hope it does.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jared, this is Bryan. If you would ask us 6, 8 months ago and say, how would you feel going into the second
6 months and maybe the next 12 months of pandemic? How would you feel about things? I don't think we would
have said things would look as good as they do right now. And so, we're pleased with the progress. I pointed out
earlier the significant impact of the fiscal programs that Congress has put in place. BJ mentioned some of the
uncertainty that still exists in the environment.
And we still believe – I believe very strongly personally that in certain sectors of our economy consumers and
some of the more severely impacted industries associated with social distancing and the fallout of the pandemic
need some targeted fiscal support. So, I believe strongly that the next several weeks they may be – weeks,
months of how Congress deals with additional fiscal support is going to set the direction for the next several
quarters. I'm optimistic today. I think they're making progress. But as BJ said, with the uncertainty, we think it was
appropriate to maintain strong reserves going into the fourth quarter in the turn of 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then I guess maybe just a bigger picture question, do you feel like you're
able to maybe more immediately go on the offense and take advantage of some of the market disruption in your
markets from the larger competitors or larger deals that have happened? Or are you still more focused on
integration first and that more of an offensive stance would be end of the year – I'm sorry, end of next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, depending on how you define offense, Jared. I would say, I think we are very flatfooted in terms of taking an
opportunity in the market to pick up new relationships. And while I didn't mention it earlier, we're seeing the
beginnings of very nice revenue synergy between the two organizations, IBERIABANK and First Horizon.
It is very – it's an environment that is somewhat unique in that you've got to be cautious as you look at what you
put on the balance sheet and how you use the balance sheet. But we're looking for opportunities to take

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
advantage of this dislocation. And we've seen benefits from the PPP program and we think there'll be additional
opportunities down the road.
If it relates to further M&A, that's not really in our frame of reference today. We're focused on the merger and the
integration that we have in front of us. I said earlier, I'll repeat, it's a tremendous amount of work between now and
early September of next year. As BJ said, our teams are working really, really hard and doing a great job and I'm
excited about what our associates are going to get accomplished. But that's most important and then we'll figure
out what's next after that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
One thing I would add to the question about opportunities for the offence, we are seeing what I would call some
generational opportunities with prospects that our bankers have been calling on in various markets where in some
cases years that are really great opportunities to bring those into the fold to become clients. So, these are
businesses that have survived through many cycles that we know well and opportunities to bring those over.
But we are being selective as you can imagine at this time, but we do remain open for business for the right
profiles, the right industry and the right client selection which has been important really to both legacy banks for
many, many years.

your margin guidance were, I guess, down 10 basis points plus or minus. Is that on a – do you expect that decline
in the core margin? And then when we look at the $454 million in core NII, do you expect that number to go higher
or lower in fourth quarter and beyond?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, let's see. Let's start. When I said high single digit, low double digit, that was more on the reported NIM
side. I think we can be a little bit better on the core NIM. Due to opportunities around further deposit, rate paid,
reductions, some of the opportunities that we're seeing in higher yield portfolios like loans to mortgage
companies, putting excess cash to work and those types of things. So I feel pretty good about that.
Clearly, as you know in merger accounting, we had a higher level of accretion this quarter which we expect to be
modestly lower in the fourth which is driving a lot of the decline in the reported NIM. But as I've said, we expect
the NIM to bottom out in the fourth quarter and then into next year be relatively stable to hopefully modestly
improving as we do some of the things that I just mentioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And the core NII of $454 million, do you think that goes higher from here or lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, like I said, if the margin is – if the core margin I think is relatively stable, maybe down a little bit into the
fourth but bottoming out, then it's going to be a question of how do we put the excess cash to work, improve the
deposit rate paid and see what kind of loan growth that we can have in terms of opportunities into 2021. So, I
guess to your question, I see it kind of bottoming out and then being able to hopefully improve into 2021 if the
economy gets better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. So, we should expect some decline in fourth quarter in line with your sort of core NII – core NIM decline,
but from then on, it should stabilize as we look into the first half of next year? Is that reasonable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Yeah. So, I'd say the core NII we think could be flattish going into the fourth quarter and then hopefully
improving with opportunities going into next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And sorry to ask so many questions on that. I think there's just a big divergence in terms of
expectations around NII next year, so it's helpful in terms of the color you provided. And just in terms of expenses.
So, thanks for the update on what the cost savings tied to the integration, both First Horizon and IBERIA had a
pretty strong track record in terms of expense management. We are seeing banks kind of take another look at
real estate costs, other expenses coming out of the lockdowns. Just talk to us in terms of what's the opportunity
like in terms of expense savings meaningfully exceeding the $170 million that you laid out.

Yeah. So, I think you've heard – you heard Bryan used the term $170 million-plus, I used the term at least $170
million. So clearly, we are very confident in our ability to get to $170 million and that's not even an issue for us.
We are looking beyond that to find further cost reduction which we're highly confident that we can capture. We
want to make sure that we get all the $170 million in the numbers. But we are working on things like customer
behavior changes and the impacts on branches and how customers want to do business with us. We have 5.5
million square feet of office space and branch space that we certainly think that we can optimize further over time
given changes due to the pandemic.
And we are working very hard as we put our systems and processes together to find opportunities to use the
systems upgrades and new systems that we're putting in place to find further process improvements and do a lot
of work around RPAs and so on, which Anthony and Randy and their teams have had great expertise at.
So, we are confident that the $170 million is going to happen. It's a question of how much higher. And so, we'll
come out further in the fourth quarter and into 2021 talking about further plans that we have to continue to get
cost saves. But this is a journey not a destination, particularly given this environment. We're highly confident we'll
be able to deliver as we have before.

Ebrahim, this is Bryan. To add to BJ's comments, I think he's exactly right. You have to keep in mind that we have
a lot of moving parts right now with the integration and we want to be thoughtful about how we put the two
organizations together and not do things that damage the customer franchise while we integrate. So, we're being
thoughtful about expenses.
That said, BJ is absolutely right. We think we can do, and we'll do more than $170 million. And we don't think we
should try to pin the tail on that number today but we will sometime in the not too distant future. It is clear to us
that the effect of the COVID-19 experience and the pandemic has changed customer behaviors probably for the
long term. It has changed our work habits, it has changed a lot of things.
Then, we believe very firmly that we need to factor all of that into how we put these two organizations together,
how we look at expenses, what our branch or banking center coverage look like. And BJ went through a lot of the
important details that we're looking at. So, it's a work in progress. We're committing to doing more than $170
million. We'll be back to you with how much down the road.

Hi, Steve.

Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, first, just a follow-up BJ in your comments for the core NIM to hold stable in the fourth quarter. It seems that
excess cash is going to build, right? So, you're going to have even more weight on the NIM in 4Q. So, it's a
thought that at least in the short run you realign deposit costs. I don't know if it's a 4Q event that you get to the
mid-20s and that's the near-term support. And then from there, you deploy excess cash and that's what provides
further support to NIM, because it was apparent core NIM would go down in the fourth quarter based on just the
cash phenomenon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, Steve, good question. Our current expectation is that we are able to put more of the excess cash to
work in the fourth quarter. So, we did see an increase into the end of the period from some of the averages. But
the strategies that we're contemplating now, including letting contracts expire on market index deposits, some of
the things we're thinking about to soak up the excess cash around either loan portfolio or securities portfolio and
other things, we think that we can move the excess cash position down.
The other is, we still think that there's opportunity in loans to mortgage companies as well which is a very efficient
use of our excess cash. And so, usually seasonally, that business can be down but given the very strong
environment that we're seeing today in the mortgage space, we think that it could hold up in terms of balances in
the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then on the reserve, I hear the comments, right, you're still cautious given
we are still in the middle of a pandemic. But when we look at the reserve, right, it's $1 billion. It's 1.8% ex-PPP,
and that's on top of the credit mark. And if you have strong loan growth and mortgage warehouse, you don't really
need reserves for those. So, if the rest of loan demand is somewhat muted, why would you need to provide any
additional provision over the next few quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I hope you're right. I think – as I said in the beginning, we're taking a pretty cautious stance at this point, right? It's
a lot easier to be conservative at this point and hold reserves and then release them as opposed to be too quick
13

to let reserves go and then see a reversal of the improvement in the economy and have to build reserves again.
So, I'm highly confident again in where our reserves are and our loss absorption capacity. And I do think that
eventually we will release reserves, but we think it's a little too early to make that call at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then finally, you guys are pointing out that the three-year plan is finalized or getting finalized in
the fourth quarter. Bryan, should we expect anything material from that in terms of revenue or additional expense
initiatives? What should we get out of that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, yes. I don't think that in the short run you should expect any significant shift in our business. This is really
bringing together the combined organization. The team has done and – Anthony Restel has done a good job
leading it, but the team has done a great job pulling the strategy together. And what I think that you will see out of
it is where we're going to focus in markets and products set and it's about how we have combined focus as an
organization.
Then – and as we said a couple of different ways, clearly, expense control will be an element of that. But what
we're really trying to focus on is beyond the integration. What is it that we need to be executing on to be on the
ground running through the integration? And then, most particularly, to really pick up momentum when we get that
completed in September of next year. So, it's got to – a strong focus on markets and where we invest and where
we put people and product, how we work on our cross-sell opportunities, the revenue synergies that exist by
bringing the combined products together.
And we believe, given what we've seen on a macro basis in the US, that the states that we do business in, the
markets that we do business in, are going to be very positively impacted by the migration of people and
businesses and opportunity. And we just want to be positioned to make sure that we take full advantage of that.

Thank you. Just piling on to Steve's question on the reserve, BJ. I mean, what do you need to see to tap that
reserve? Because I think the point here is that, relative to peers, you're very well set up. Is this something that a
Moody's outlook would reveal where you'd have the confidence? Or is it, hey, you just doubled the size of the
bank and give us a couple quarters, but we get it, it's coming down? And any further color there?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, the way these models are built as you know is that the quantitative part of the models are driven largely
by historical loss history as well as what the forward view is as informed by the Moody's scenarios. We then
create qualitative overlays particularly in stressed portfolios in sectors where we have a little bit more concern or
uncertainty around it.
And as you might imagine that if the outlook continues to get better, which we certainly hope it does, the
quantitative models are going to tell us to release reserves. And at some point we're going to be comfortable that
the qualitatives that we have aren't needed.
So, again, I think we're well reserved. I do think reserves will come down into next year. It's a question of timing.
And we just think at this point, given continued uncertainty that it's better to hold it as opposed to release it. But
we are confident that we are well reserved and we'll be able to do so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And regarding the – I believe it's 2.4% deferrals, what do you see is the end game there? Are
most of these are going to return to normal, P&I payments and a chunk restructured with very little real breakage
or something different? How does that – how do you think that plays?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brock, based on even what we've seen of when it was at a higher level a couple of quarters ago, many are
returning, just returning to making their payments. Some of them were cautious in the beginning and just said if I
can take a deferral I will. There will be some clearly that we will work with to restructure. But at this point, we're
seeing very, very few clients ask for that what I would call a third round of deferral which I think is very good,
which is why the active deferrals have come down so dramatically.
But we are, as you saw on one of the pages where we talked about our perceived updates on areas of perceived
risk, I think that was page 14, in addition to [ph] overlaid that (00:44:28) portfolios as a whole, we continued – we
did it in the second quarter, third quarter, we'll do it in this quarter. And as long as we need to with any sort of
uncertainty around COVID, we're also doing the [indiscernible] (00:44:44) with individual clients.
So, we've got really good insight. And one of the things that I continue to feel very good about is the fact that our
prudent underwriting in the beginning, the client selection and seeing our business owners, guarantors, sponsors
working with us during this time, we've seen a lot of I think positives around that.
So, you'll see – your question was what are you going to see. I think you'll see some of all of that. You'll see some
that'll just return to normal. You'll see some that will have to work with us on a longer term basis. And so, we
stand ready client-by-client to make that happen.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
If I could just kind of beat the dead horse a little more here on the reserve. If I could kind of go about it this way
and can you just maybe give us a little bit of the granularity of your credit details behind what may have influenced
your thoughts on the reserve? Particularly, do you have your criticized and classified asset trends for the third
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We do. Hey, John. This is Susan. So, overall our criticized went from 2.7% to 3.3%, so that's on an
obviously combined basis for second quarter to third quarter with both banks. So, you did see some increase of
about $400 million that moved into the criticized category.
In terms of the portfolios where we looked at doing a qualitative overlay, there's a portfolio you would imagine that
we would, and if you look at the areas of perceived risk, we have an additional overlay for energy, additional
overlays for hotels, for retail. And for some of the nonprofit and also the casual dining food service. So, those are
areas where I think Bryan and BJ have said that on many of these questions, we do – we're seeing some things
loosen up. We're seeing some trends that we like, but we just think it's too early to be thinking about releasing
reserves. But based on what we know now, we should be able to do that in a quarter or two if we continue to see
good trends.

D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
This is Bryan. To use your phrase, there are a lot of ways to come at beating this dead horse, and at the end of
the day CECL implies a heck of a lot more precision than actually exists in reality. And we've sort of look at this as
a bit of an art and we apply these overlays mainly because it is too early and there is a degree of uncertainty
about what will happen in terms of fiscal stimulus and how the pandemic plays out. How far away are we from
therapeutics? How far away from a vaccination?
There is no intended signaling whatsoever that we see something about the portfolio that causes us to just keep
them up other than we believe that we will lean into the art. We've remained conservative, it's been our practice
over many years, and we will continue to evaluate it. We're, as I said, optimistic about how things are positioned
today on October the 22nd or 23rd, whatever the day is. And we think this can play out very, very well. And when
it does, we'll release these reserves and they'll come back.

And then, separately, on the expense side, BJ, are you – can you kind of just repeat the expense guidance for

commissions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. John, thanks. So what I said was that our expense base excluding incentives and commissions which, as
you obviously know, are going to rise and fall with revenue related fee income, we expect that expense base ex
incentives and commissions to be down low-single digits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I was just going to add quickly, if you look in our press release and the supplement, we did reorganize those – the
expense line items a little bit to make it easier for you all to explicitly see the incentives and commissions broken
out from the rest of the expense base such that it's easier for you to visibly see the expense discipline and the
merger cost saves as they come through.

expense base excluding incentives and commissions, that's the 1.5 to 2. Because remember, the first half of 2020
excluded IBKC, so you got to utilize that third quarter annualized base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey. So, thanks for pointing out all the onetime items. But aside from the four or three or four notable items that
you guys called out, were there any other line items in the income statement that were impacted by, I'm just going
to say volatility, that might not recur in future quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ellen A. Taylor A
Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I think we mentioned the true-up of the IBKC benefit. So, from a linked quarter perspective, there was an
initial step-up there that will persist but you shouldn't see a repeat of the step-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
That's right. Ken, I can't think of anything that we would specifically call out for all of you. I think broadly speaking,
what John just asked about our expense base from 3Q 2020 annualized versus 2021, it would all be captured in
there. We wouldn't call anything else out other than the notable items.

quarter is going to remain strong. But where does that sort of normalize when we think about 2021?

Yeah. Ken, we still think that for the foreseeable future, and I can't exactly put a fine point on foreseeable future,
but we think that the countercyclical businesses are going to remain strong. I mean, if you look at mortgage
origination volumes and home price demand, it is still very, very strong. And so we're benefiting from that. And so
we expect that, that's going to continue for both the mortgage origination side as well as the loans to mortgage
companies side.
I would say that we had, if you look in our information, very strong gain on sale percentage this quarter, we still
think that volumes are going to be high. Gain on sale was probably higher than what it would normally be going
forward. We expect that to moderate a little bit, but in aggregate, we expect that the businesses will continue to
drive outperformance and help us offset some of the NII headwinds that we see.

I wanted to start with loan growth. I know when we talked about it last quarter you said to expect kind of modest
loan growth at best. It seems like loan balances, if you back out the acquisition noise, were up a little bit
organically in the third quarter from the mortgage warehouse. But as you look forward, how do you think about
loan growth? A lot of times when you do big acquisitions like this, there is some loans that tend to run off. So, do
you expect to see kind of some near-term loan shrinkage in 4Q? And then just how do you think about loan
growth as we look into 2021?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, I'll start and Bryan and Susan can jump in. But there are a few areas of growth that we think can
certainly help us going into 2021. Loans to mortgage companies of course we continue to think could be strong.
There are specialty businesses beyond loans to mortgage companies, like asset-based lending, like equipment
finance, that are very strong today and we expect those to continue going into next year.
We don't have any portfolios, aside from what we're doing to manage our exposure to energy of course, but more
broadly speaking, we don't have any other portfolios that we are actively managing down or managing off. So, I
don't expect any material step-downs in terms of other areas of portfolio. But traditional loan demand broadly
across consumer and commercial portfolios is, like we've said, pretty muted at this point.
So, we do have pockets of opportunity that can offset some declines. So, we don't have very high expectations for
loan growth going into 2021. That's not because we don't want to look for new opportunities. As Susan said
earlier, we are and we will. But it's just the nature of the environment right now that we've got to pick our spots.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, not a ton of growth next year. If you look at – I heard you guys say that Common Equity Tier 1 the
targeted range is 9% to 9.25%. You're at 9.15% now. With decent profitability and not a lot of growth, that ratio I'm
guessing is going to move higher pretty rapidly. So, how do you think about – buybacks seemed off the table this
year, but as we look into next year, 2021, how do you think about share buybacks as your Common Equity Tier 1
moves over the top end of that targeted range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Brady, this is Bryan. It's clearly our desire to put capital to work in organic growth opportunities. And so,
we're always looking for that as the first way to leverage our balance sheet. And we'll know a whole lot more
about what 2021 loan growth looks like when we get past the turn of the year. We're very conscious of
maintaining a strong capital base. The dividend and the buyback are clearly vehicles for repatriating capital to
shareholders that we can't put to use in the balance sheet.
So, I don't want to get out in front of our board and the discussions there. I feel very, very good about where our
dividend is. I think it's unlikely in the near-term that we start the repurchase program, but we're constantly looking
at how that capital ratio builds and how it fits into our expected usage in the balance sheet.
This problem that we all sit here with today and it's universally true of financial services industry, there are more
known and unknowns than we've ever experienced and we'll all be smarter in 90 days. And so we'll have a more
clear view of where we think that capital goes. But to your basic point, we think that capital will accumulate, that
we will see growth in not only our tier 1 – CET1, but we'll also see growth in our tangible book value.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Susan, when you talked about the criticized assets being at 3.3%, does that include the higher risk
items that – on slide 14?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. That's the total criticized.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
[indiscernible] (00:59:35) is 3.3%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
But not everything in the higher risk category is a criticized asset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. It's a subset of the 3.3%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
That's what I want to know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
The ones we highlighted for you on page 14 are just ones that – areas that we're paying very, very close attention
to and are a big part of these portfolio reviews that we're doing. And I'm glad to say this, there are things on this
page that I think we're even being conservative calling it a higher risk because of how we've underwritten and the
things we're hearing about from our clients.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
So, we wanted to kind of give you the full list, but I would say within some of these things, I'll give you an example,
our CRE retail is very much a value oriented, many are grocery anchored, we've seen very little issues there with
the most recent portfolio review we did. We saw very few problems in that portfolio. So, I just wanted to tell you, I
think even this list of perceived risk isn't – were on the conservative side. But I believe that's how we want to be.
You've heard Bryan and BJ say that on other questions on this call. We just want to be prudent and cautious
during this time until we kind of get through things like the election, potential vaccines, etcetera, and see how the
economy if it continues to open up. But we are pleased with what we're seeing even in some of these areas of
perceived risk.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No, that's helpful background. Thank you both for that. I just – I was just curious if the trend would be to see more
migrate on to criticized or could it possibly go the other way or perhaps it's too soon to tell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think – I mean, again, we are again touching these every quarter. Could you see a few of them go
criticized? You could. But based on what we know now, we've got them graded the way we believe they need to
be graded. The other thing is, we are actually seeing some upgrades too. So, there are pockets of industries that
are doing extremely well, and there are players even within these higher risk industries that are better perform –
performing very, very well. We point out an example of that within the hotels. And we're in some of these markets.
We've been in these markets a long time that are doing really, really well would be mountain areas, beach areas
where people can drive. We've talked to clients who were having even within hotel portfolios their best year ever.
And it's a combination of people wanting to just get away. They can still work from there and these hotel operators
are able to do it with a lower expense base. Same thing with quick serve restaurants, many of them still are just
drive through only and their expense base is down to – dropping to the bottom line and is even better than 2019.
So, that's what I think is so important, the fact that we've gone and done this portfolio review, we're talking to
individual clients, but again still being cautious and wanting to highlight for all of you the areas that we continue to
look at quarter-over-quarter during this COVID situation.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2020
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Is there any consideration to a bulk loan sale of any of these more at-risk loans, particularly hotels? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Jennifer, this is Bryan, and we're not – we feel good about the quality of the portfolio. We were very confident in
what we know about it. And it doesn't seem to make any sense to me or to us to sell it at a significant discount so
somebody else can profit on the performance of that portfolio. So, it will – we'll have a few problems here and
there. But, overall, we feel good about it. We feel good about our reserve levels and we don't have any interest in
selling any of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Bryan, this is a more longer term question. What are your thoughts about remote working for your employee base
going forward? Is the new normal going to be some combination of in-office and remote working for almost
everyone? And how do you maintain corporate culture with more remote working? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. That's I think a fantastic topic and I think it's – we framed it very well. We spent a lot of time talking about
that very thing and BJ mentioned the 5-plus-million square feet of space that we have. We think people are going
to work differently. There's no doubt about that. Our customers are going to perform differently and it is going to
be different. I worry more about the downsides of managing corporate culture, the conversations that don't
happen because you don't get an elevator ride with somebody you thought at that – next time I see him, I need to
say this or have this conversation.
I think it's really a big downside in the sense that if you onboard new people, when you bring in new bankers, how
do you bring them into the culture? How do you mentor people? How do you develop people? So, I think we've
got to find sort of a balance. And I think we'll end up, as you suggested, in a bit of a hybrid environment where
24

people work more remotely for a portion of their time and we figure out how we spend the time we have together
in a more quality fashion so that we don't just assume everybody can see everybody every day.
So, I don't think anybody on our side believe we've got it figured out today but we're paying a lot of attention to it.
And I think while we could go cut out a lot of office space and do things remotely because we've proven with
technology that it works, you really have a hard time, as you said, maintaining corporate culture in a two-
dimensional framework over Webex or a Zoom conference call. So it's something that we're clearly paying
attention to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to
Bryan Jordan, CEO, for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. As we've said a number of different times
this morning, we're optimistic about how we're positioned, we're optimistic about what our combined organization
is capable of doing, we're optimistic about the opportunities we see in our markets with expanded customer
product set as well as the ability to bring the full suite of products of the combined organization to bear on existing
relationships.
If you have any questions or any additional follow up, please let any of us know and we're more than happy to
provide you additional information. Thank you, again for interest in our company and I hope everybody has a
