Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Frank and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference call. All lines have been
placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Please go ahead, sir.

Bryan K. Gill
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial
Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly,
Executive Vice President and CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under
Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2021, and PNC undertakes no obligation to
update them.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. As you saw, we had a solid start to the year, as we grew revenue and
controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison.
Our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic
outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans, as we continue to work through the
COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. Our capital and liquidity
levels also remain at record highs.
With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment
securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought
later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in TBAs that are going to settle early in the second
quarter here. And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to
operate, notwithstanding this, at very high levels of cash at the Fed that can be deployed over time in loans or
securities-based on market opportunities.
While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market
issuance levels, paydowns and competition, resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of
the US economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over
time.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will
significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA
integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approval. We haven't found any
significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working
effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. With the quality of
BBVA markets, especially in their largest market in Texas – excuse me, and the quality of their largest markets,
especially in Texas and – is proving to be everything we hoped it would.
As we plan for the integration of BBVA USA, we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we
can better serve our customers. Earlier this week, PNC launched Low Cash Mode, which fundamentally changes
the banking experience for our Virtual Wallet customers by allowing them to avoid overdraft fees through
unprecedented account transparency and control.
Low Cash Mode represents a shift away from the industry's widely used overdraft approach, which drives
customer dissatisfaction and which we believe is unsustainable. We firmly believe this differentiated approach will
drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships over time as we execute our national
expansion strategy.
Low Cash Mode allows our Virtual Wallet customers to see and control what's happening in their checking
accounts in real time. If a customer's balance is negative or about to go negative, they have at least 24 hours to
cure their negative balance by determining whether certain payments are processed that otherwise might result in
overdrafts.
This payment control is a significant differentiator that we believe will help customers avoid overdraft fees of
approximately $125 million to $150 million annually. PNC's full year 2021 revenue outlook anticipated this fee
reduction, as did our estimate of BBVA's PPNR contribution to PNC and, as a result, is not impacted by this
change.
I'd like to close by thanking our employees who continue to support our clients and communities through the
various COVID challenges by executing on our value-added relationship-based model. And with that, I'll turn it
over to Rob for a closer look at results and then we'll take your questions.

Robert Q. Reilly
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or
$4.10 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on slide 3 and is presented on an average basis.
During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion, or 3%, due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand.
Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances
increased $9 billion, or 11%, as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the
steepening yield curve. Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter,
driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance.
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion, or 2%, linked quarter.
Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt
obligations. Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-
quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as of
March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Regarding capital return, our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per
share, or approximately $500 million. And, as you know, we continue to suspend our share repurchases during
the first quarter as we await regulatory approval for our pending BBVA USA acquisition. Assuming a midyear
close, we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.
Slide 4 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $238 billion in the first
quarter were down $8 billion, or 3%, compared to the fourth quarter. Commercial loan balances declined $5.4
billion, or 3%, as overall utilization rates declined to historically low levels. Beyond that, Paycheck Protection
Program balances remained flat as originations were offset by loans forgiven. And within our commercial real
estate business, multifamily warehouse lending declined seasonally by $2 billion.
Consumer loans were down $2.3 billion with lower balances across all consumer categories as loan demand
continued to soften due to the higher consumer cash levels. The yield on loan balances was 3.38%, a 3 basis
point increase compared to the fourth quarter. However, the increase reflected elevated commercial real estate
prepayment fees and higher PPP loan forgiveness during the quarter.
The rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits is now 6 basis points, a 2 basis point decline linked quarter.
Average deposits increased $6 billion, or 2%, driven by enhanced consumer liquidity, primarily related to
government stimulus payments. In the year-over-year comparison, total average loans decreased 2%, or $5
billion, primarily due to the elevated drawdown that occurred during the first quarter of 2020. Deposits increased
$76 billion, or 26%, and again, were driven by the high cash balances of our customers.
As a point of context, consumer checking account balances are, on average, roughly 40% higher than this time a
year ago. As a result, our period-end loan to deposit ratio has declined to a historic low of 63% at the end of the
first quarter compared to 87% in the same period in 2020.
Slide 5 details the change in our average securities and Federal Reserve balances over the past year. Security
balances of $86 billion in the first quarter increased $2 billion, or 2%, compared to the same period a year ago.
Over the same time, our Fed balances have increased nearly fivefold driven by significant government stimulus
as well as the proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.
As most of you know, during 2020, we were patient in deploying this excess liquidity, while interest rates remain
at historically low levels. However, with the recent yield curve steepening, we accelerated our rate of purchasing,
increasing our spot balances by $9 billion, with another $9 billion of forward settling securities as of March 31.
Average security balances now represent approximately 20% of interest-earning assets. And our expectation is to
build these balances to approximately 25% to 30% by year-end.
As you can see on slide 6, net income of $1.8 billion grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting strong
pre-tax pre-provision earnings and a substantial provision recapture. First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, up
slightly compared with the fourth quarter, driven by higher noninterest income, which was 44% of total revenue in
the first quarter.
Expenses declined $134 million, or 5%, and remained well controlled. The provision recapture of $551 million
reflected improved forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances. Now let's discuss the key drivers of
this performance in more detail.

Turning to Slide 7. This chart illustrates our diversified business mix. Total revenue increased $12 million
compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest income of $2.3 billion was down $76 million, or 3%, primarily
due to lower loan balances and two fewer days. Net interest margin of 2.27% declined 5 basis points, reflecting
the impact of higher Fed cash balances. Importantly, we think NIM has bottomed this quarter and expect it to
slowly rise throughout 2021.
Noninterest income grew $88 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee income of $1.4 billion decreased $102
million or 7%. Most of the decline was driven by lower corporate service fees related to elevated fourth quarter
merger and acquisition advisory activity. Additionally, consumer services and service charges on deposits were
down slightly, reflecting seasonally lower activity and higher consumer cash balances. And growth in both asset
management fees and residential mortgage revenue partially offset some of the decline.
Other noninterest income of $483 million grew $190 million and included higher revenue from both private equity
and underwriting. Linked-quarter growth also reflected the impact of the $173 million negative Visa derivative
adjustment in the fourth quarter.
Compared to the same period a year ago, total revenue declined $116 million, as a decrease in net interest
income from lower interest rates and volumes was partially offset by growth in our broad-based fee businesses.
Turning to slide 8, expenses were down by $134 million, or 5%, linked quarter, across all categories, primarily due
to disciplined expense management and seasonality. Year-over-year expenses increased $31 million, or 1%, and
remained well controlled.
During the first quarter, we generated 5% linked-quarter positive operating leverage and, as a result, our
efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 61%. We remain deliberate around our expense management and, as
we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2021 through our Continuous
Improvement Program and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a
significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 9 and reflect improvement in all these three major categories.
Nonperforming loans decreased $148 million, or 6%, compared to December 31. Commercial nonperforming
loans declined by $174 million, or 19%, which reflected portfolio activity as well as improved credit performance.
Consumer nonperforming loans increased $26 million related to residential real estate and home equity loans as
a result of borrowers exiting forbearance.
Total delinquencies of $1.1 billion at March 31 decreased $217 million or 16%. Consumer loan delinquencies
declined $203 million, primarily due to lower auto and residential real estate. And commercial loan delinquencies
decreased by $14 million.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $146 million, a decline of $83 million, linked quarter. Commercial net
charge-offs of $51 million decreased by $58 million, driven by lower gross charge-offs. And consumer net charge-
offs of $95 million declined by $25 million, primarily in our auto and credit card portfolios. Annualized net charge-
offs to total loans in the first quarter was 25 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same
period last year.
Slide 10 shows a $724 million reduction in our allowance for credit losses during the first quarter. Portfolio
changes represented $251 million of the decline, primarily driven by lower loan balances. $473 million of the
release in reserves was related to economic and qualitative factors. Improvement in our economic outlook was

partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE portfolio, particularly in the areas directly impacted by
COVID. In total, our quarter end reserves were $5.2 billion, representing 2.2% of our loans.
Turning to slide 11, I want to highlight the progress we made toward completing the acquisition of BBVA USA.
Notably, we filed all major regulatory applications and have completed a completed a number of our key pre-close
objectives. We're on track to close the acquisition midyear and remain confident in our ability to achieve the
financial objectives we laid out at the time that we announced the deal.
In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, our current
expectations are for GDP to surpass pre-recession levels sometime during the third quarter and for the Fed
Funds rate to remain near zero throughout 2021. Looking at the second quarter of 2021, compared to the first
quarter of 2021, we expect total average loan balances to be stable. We expect NII to be up approximately 2%.
We expect fee income to be up approximately 3% to 5%. We expect other noninterest income to be between
$300 million and $350 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total noninterest expense to
be stable. And we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $150 million and $200 million.
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we expect PNC standalone to remain stable year-over-year in regard to
both revenue and expenses. We do expect revenue benefits from the higher rate environment and increased
securities balances. However, average loans will continue to be a drag through at least the first half of 2021. We
acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year but that remains to be
seen and, as a result, is not included in our guidance.
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA, we're increasing our expectations for the full year benefit to
PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue from $600 million to $700 million, primarily driven by refinements to interest
rate assumptions. Consistent with last quarter, this expectation excludes integration costs and assumes a
midyear close.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hi, good morning.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So two questions. One, on your NII guide, you mentioned up approximately 2%, that's for the first quarter.
But then in the commentary around...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Second quarter, sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And then in the commentary around your securities book, you were highlighting that you're planning to
raise securities book to what, 20% to 25 – 25% to 30% by year-end. So I just wanted to get your sense, as you're
building towards your goal by year-end, should we be anticipating that this rate of change of improvement in
second quarter NII is something that we should be expecting could persist if the forward curve sticks around
where it is in 3Q and 4Q as well?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You want to answer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. So yes, again, that was for the second quarter on the NII guide. When we take a look at the full year, and
this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year, we do expect some more NII from
our securities book as we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than
what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable.
In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's three things, really. One, we have put more money
to work because the curve has steepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And
then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running, as a percentage of our interest-earning assets, securities
balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range, we're guiding toward more
of the 25% to 30% range. Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And Betsy, the only thing I would add is, you said it's kind of a goal. It's not really a goal. It's just our expectation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Expectation. That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Given the carry right now and how much cash we're sitting on that – the reason we put that in there is that our
security balances and, frankly, for the whole industry are likely to run higher as a percentage of our total assets
than they have historically. And we'll keep adding to them throughout the year, opportunistically, as we've done.
You see that in the actions we took late in the fourth quarter – sorry, late in the first quarter. If we were simply
trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that.
We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] Yeah. Sure. (20:49)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And you'll see us do that. You've seen us do that, but you'll see us continue to do that through the course of the
year.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I totally get it. It's such an unusual environment here with the loan-to-deposit ratio so low and what's going on with
the liquidity in your books, so that makes a lot of sense. And the revenue being stable for the full year with the
loan commentary you just made, I mean part of that is a function of the PPP roll-off that's expected. Is that fair?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Was just going to say, look, the biggest unknown on loan growth, specifically, is when the inventory build starts for
our corporate customers. Utilization is running as much as 11 points below the peak, maybe 5 points below sort of
historic averages. And even though the economy is really kind of taken off here, for whatever reason, we haven't
seen the typical inventory build and CapEx that you would see in this economy, I guess just hesitancy waiting for
more certainty on the pandemic. But when that happens, and it will happen, it almost mechanically has to happen,
you're going to see pretty appreciable loan growth. We just don't know when that's going to be.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Hey, Bill, wanted to follow up on the loan growth thoughts and we're all just kind of thinking out loud here. But
could we see the inventory and the CapEx pickup, but still not kind of see loan demand because corporates have
a lot of cash and other alternatives in supply? How much is that a factor, too, do you think going on right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That will obviously impact our large corporate book, which I think, at the moment, has its lowest utilization rate
ever. But the bulk of our book, remember, some 90-plus-percent of our clients are private companies. And so, our
middle market and commercial book really doesn't have access to the public markets and that cash build that
you're seeing in large corporate. So I do think you'll see utilization there increase. By the way, we've seen
utilization increases in our asset-based lending book...

John E. McDonald Q

Got it. And Rob, did you say that you're not building in a second half pickup too much in your expectation?

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We're not. Yeah. That is what I said, John, yeah. Because at this point, it's conjecture.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. And Rob, a follow-up for you. Obviously, your capital ratios have gone quite high. Is it fair – and I know you
don't want to get into deal assumptions and all that, but is it fair for us to think that you'll end – close the deal with
higher capital than the 9.3% pro forma, just given where you're starting from now? And could you remind us to
just what CET1 ratio feels appropriate as a target for you guys longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Sure. On the BBVA, yeah, I would say, on everything, we'll have a whole bunch of numbers for you
once we close the deal. But for today's purposes, we're tracking at or above all of our assumptions, including the
CET1 ratio. So, yeah, my estimations are that it will be higher than that 9.3%, but we'll get into that detail once we
own the bank.
In regard to our targets, we've always said around 8.5%. That's been sort of the level that we felt comfortable
with. Obviously, we've been a lot higher than that. So the relevance of that number isn't as strong as it was a few
years ago.

(26:48) I mean, certain parts of the country just didn't necessarily shut down, they reopened earlier, more quickly,
et cetera. I guess, I'm just curious if there's any differences either geographically or anywhere?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Not particularly, no. We haven't seen geographic differences. Utilization is low across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

...I appreciate the thoughts there. And then, maybe, just more of a ticky-tack one. The other fee expectation, so it
was a very, very strong quarter this quarter. I think the guide is a bit higher than is typical in the second quarter.
Just maybe sort of the nuance, Rob, on just sort of how you're thinking about that line going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. That's – we get some volatility on that quarter-to-quarter because there's a lot of elements there. But the
guide to the $300 million to $350 million is what we expect to occur in the second quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. During this earnings season, we've asked a lot of questions, as analysts, of when loan growth
is going to recover from a cyclical standpoint. But I'm wondering, given the deal expected to close in midyear and
as we think about how this could potentially help, maybe, Bill, talk through how these newer markets could
potentially give you an even better opportunity to capture loan growth recovery once that come?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think that's going to be the case. But I think one of the things we've been careful to do and sort of framing our
expectations for you guys around BBVA was we recognize that there are parts of their balance sheet that we
would likely shrink, both because of concentrations across the combined firm but also because there are some
sectors they don't want to be in, offset by our growth in these new markets.
So in the out-years, I get really bullish about our growth potential. But for the first year or so, we're going to – and
we've – this is all in sort of the numbers we gave you, there's going to be a little trade-off of we'll be growing the
business we want as we shrink some of the business we won't. So the real acceleration is probably a couple
years down the road.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And as you have made more progress on – towards closing the deal, can you give us a sense of you still
feel like there's not going to be a significant amount of investment that you have to put into the combined
franchise in terms of technology and other things. So obviously, some investors are thinking about another deal
that had closed prior, where there was a lot of investment spend that was a little bit of a surprise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

That's the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I won't talk about what other people are doing, but we pretty much have this nailed down. We know – and it's all in
the numbers we've given you. We are going to invest in certain capacity for their branches, for example, on
connectivity, faster routers. And we're going to expand some of the compute capacity we have in our cloud. But all
of that, we've given you, and it's not a big deal. It was all on the deal assumptions and all those thing are proving
to be correct.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the fee side, 3% to 5% growth in the second off of what
was pretty good numbers to begin in the first. Just wondering if you could help us understand just where your
expected growth is coming from and what do you think's going to lead that forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure, Ken. Yeah, I would say on the fees, as we look forward to the second quarter relative to the guide,
corporate services and consumer services will be up, we'd expect, in sort of that mid-single-digit range, and then
the other fee categories, asset management, mortgage and service charges on deposits, probably low single
digits. So that's sort of how we get to that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up on mortgage, obviously, not a bigger line for you guys, but just given
some – the changes in the business you guys have been making and the relatively new platform, just – do you
see share gain opportunities? And is the fight just against gain-on-sale margins in terms of just how resi can
continue to build over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, yeah. I mean, hey, mortgage isn't as big as a percentage of our businesses as others, but we're very excited
about what we've built and the opportunities that we have, particularly – the market will do what the market will do,
but particularly around building out the purchase side in terms of our consumer customers, which will be
expanded with the BBVA acquisition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Last little follow-up. Just – Rob, I know you guys don't really give us a number on just premium am inside
the bond book. But can you just help us understand, has it been a drag? Is it – you're buying a lot of bonds, you're
probably still buying some premium bonds, too. Just how should we just think about that big picture? Thanks.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. In terms of the guidance for the acquisition, so from $600 million to $700 million, look, the Bank Index is up
40% since November 15 when you announced the deal. So I guess, it seems logical that your benefits are going
to be greater, especially with a fixed price. So what does that mean for 2022 and the ultimate savings? I mean,
mathematically, it's – if you look at the industry and you look at BBVA, of course, it should be higher at this point.
It's good timing. Can you say what it means for the next kind of couple years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm trying to figure out where you're going with that, Mike. I mean, we're going to – once we once we close the
deal, we'll give you some updates on numbers and so forth. I guess what I would say to you is we remain – I
remain and also even, to a greater extent, really excited by the out-year growth potential of this deal. We tend –
when you do a deal, you give kind of a year and a half worth of guidance when all the marbles are thrown up in
the air and you're working on cost saves and integration. The potential of the franchise in these markets is
phenomenal. The potential for cross-sell and for growth of new clients is phenomenal. And we're really excited by
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess I'll just wait until you close it and get more information for 2022 guidance.

Mike Mayo Q

Okay. Well, let me get some concrete numbers from you. I love what you're saying about the loan data. I love
data. So when you say you're 11 points below peak utilization and 5 points below average, what are those
numbers? And you also say corporate lending utilization is the lowest ever. What's that percentage? If I could
have those, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And that's a function of all the corporate cash. The 11-point drop was off of the high utilization we saw,
Mike, with all the draws during the first quarter of last year, which is why the average is maybe 5%. And its hit –
certain areas have been impacted more than others. Municipal utilization's way, way down. As I said, corporate
finance is way, way down. Even our asset-based business, which typically runs fairly high utilization, has really
struggled just given the lack of ability to build inventory.
So, I don't know if you remember the number, Rob, but we've messed around with – if you kind of regress
economic growth, retail sales, a whole bunch of other different things, against – and inventory levels against loan
utilization, it's an R-squared up over [ph] 0.80. (36:53)

Good morning Bill, good morning Rob.

Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys talk about – your deposit balances, of course, are up dramatically. You've given that to us. And Bill,
you've talked about the utilization of your customers with the liquidity. Is that the number one driver of possibly
taking deposits down, or some of your peer – a custody bank is not necessarily your peer, but the custody banks
are hoping for higher rates to bring their balances down. How much would rising short-term interest rates help you
guys bring down your deposit balances to get the loan-to-deposit ratio in more of a historical relationship without
having the loans having to grow dramatically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't think rise in short-term rates has any impact at all. I think, as a practical matter, deposit balances in the
industry are driven by the size of the Fed's balance sheet and fiscal transfers, coupled with loan growth. Loan
growth will actually drive more deposit balances once we see a pickup in that. And I think excess liquidity in the
system is here to stay for a long period of time, because I don't think the Fed is going to shrink their balance sheet
anytime soon. So I think we're going to be in a – there's a structural change in banking, which is going to have
more liquidity, higher security balances for an extended period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, which I agree with you guys on that as well. Shifting over to the allowance for credit losses in your
slide, I think it was slide 10, you gave us good color on the levels and what drives those with the portfolio changes
and the economic qualitative factors, recognizing BBVA is going to influence this number on the out-years. But
when you look at the reserves and you compare them to the day one reserves back in January 1, 2020, which
you guys show here, you're still well above them. And if the economy over the next 12 to 18 months is even going
to be better than what we all thought on January 1, 2020, pre-pandemic, that would suggest reserves should
come down. Do you think you'd get close to that day one level or is that just too low?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I think you can get there to that level. It's just a question like, as you pointed out, in terms of timing. So our
reserves right now reflect our current forecast. If subsequent forecasts are more bullish or more optimistic, we'll
continue on that trend. But the timing of how fast we would get there, Gerard, is, per earlier comments, difficult to
be precise about.

Hey, Matt.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Can you talk about your interest rate positioning post the actions you plan to take in the securities portfolio, and
then also after you fold in BBVA USA? I realize there are some moving pieces but what would your expectations
be in terms of how asset-sensitive you are factoring those two things in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We're going to still end up being asset-sensitive. I mean, largely, because even with our suggested build, the
deposits we're going to have with the Fed are going to be quite large. I would tell you that our duration of equity

and measured asset sensitivity has decreased as a function of the rise in rates, but that's less about what we're
doing and more about the negative convexity in the bank's balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Any way to, say, kind of, just frame how meaningfully levered you will be to rates, I guess, both the short
and long end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I mean...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I guess, put another way, like you have a lot of leverage to rising rates now, but as you grow the securities book
[ph] to that much... (42:58)

William Stanton Demchak A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We're hardly going to dent it. I mean the chart – you see the chart we have in there, where you see our cash
balances versus security balances, [ph] put (43:07) any loan growth you want in there, we're not buying the long
end of the curve, and we have a massive opportunity to deploy that. But as we always do, we're going to
increment our weigh in. By the way, incrementing our weigh in is what gets us to that 25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. And then separately, I'm probably getting a little ahead of myself here. But as we think after the
BBVA deal closes, you've clearly shifted your view to wanting branches nationally. And would the thought be to
lead with organic growth? Or because you're basically folding them into your platform, would you be ready to do
another deal, maybe quicker than normally?

We certainly, mechanically, would be ready to do another deal. I think like all things, it's a function of where you
create value. If it's cheaper to go organically, which it was for a bunch of years, then we would choose that route. I
personally believe that we will see opportunities in smaller institutions simply because of the massive shift in
technology and the cost of technology that we've seen to serve customers. So I think low rates, not a lot of loan
growth, big technology costs are going to give us opportunities to continue to create scale.

Bill and Rob, can you discuss how you guys are thinking about pent-up demand dynamics for your consumer

excess liquidity on both sides shape your view?

Robert Q. Reilly A

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yeah. I guess, just thinking about, as we look to like sort of these pent-up demand dynamics and sort of like the
reopening and like kind of animal spirits being unleashed as you look to the second half of the year and all of that
being a positive for loan growth, like how does that differ between the consumer and the commercial side? Like
there's a lot of liquidity sitting around on commercial balance sheets. There's – consumer has a lot of savings.
Does that sort of delay like the rebound in balance growth on each side, or are both sides going to be affected
similarly or differently? Can you maybe give some color or perspective on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, I know – yeah, I see where you're going. I think consumer lending's going to drag C&I increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think consumers are really flushed with cash. You've seen retail sales. I think they continue to accelerate, by the
way. But what's happening is that people who don't borrow are buying, and the people who would normally
borrow are sitting on fiscal payments that they're going to have to burn through over time before you see balance
growth.
We're seeing massive transaction volumes. So we see it in our swipe fees in effect. But I don't know that you're
going to see balance growth. I think consumer will lag commercial. And I get back this place where inside of
commercial, the smaller non-public companies and even some of the smaller public companies will continue to
rely on bank balance sheets to fuel their growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. And Bill, maybe I could circle back on a question there I'd asked you a while ago about
sort of the financial technology players, like the Chimes of the world, and maybe just specifically on, any color that
you can give on perhaps how active you are in discussions with regulators regarding sort of the uneven playing
field with many of these players, particularly some of these players are benefiting from things like unregulated
debit interchange, which was never intended for them. It was more for like the smaller bank exemption that it was
intended for post Durbin. And so, I guess, is there any expectation of a leveling of the playing field, do you see in
the future, or is this sort of the competitive landscape that is sort of the new reality?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So it is a topic of interest, both on the political and regulatory side, less about competition and more about safety
and soundness and data protection and fraud. And I'm not referring to Chime specifically, but rather new entrants
into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust Know Your
Customer rules and, frankly, probably just because of the COVID environment. All of that has gathered the
attention of politician and regulators.
The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually nobody's asked me a question
about Low Cash Mode that we rolled out this – yesterday, day before. That product is a result of years of

technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time
capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts and, therefore, showing them what's going on in their
accounts and, therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts.
No fintech has that. Go back to because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are
relying on 30-year-old COBOL-based, mainframe-based, batch processed not very exciting core processors.
Bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and – to justify their existence.
Our challenge is presenting – and we think we do this – a great proposition to our customers with ease of use and
the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about
competing with somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to
our customers who don't understand where data's being shared and who has access to it.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
That's very helpful. I was going to ask about the new service, but I saw you talk about it on CNBC, so I figured I'd
save it – save my question. If I could squeeze in maybe one last one. Are treasury departments of any of your
clients even remotely considering the idea of having some allocation to Bitcoin? We've seen some businesses
move in that direction.
And with the Coinbase IPO, I guess, it sort of seems like it's a bit out of left field, but perhaps, you could argue, is
becoming more mainstream. And so, just wondering, is that something that your treasury function is preparing
for? And then maybe on the wealth side, are any wealth clients expressing interest in gaining exposure to crypto
assets? Any thoughts on how you guys are sort of positioned for any potential emergence of crypto as a potential
asset class, especially in...

...the aftermath of that Coinbase...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, we've been working on this long before Coinbase went public back – we've talked to Coinbase about
partnership and custody for our wealth clients. Practically, we've had a workstream around this, both for our
corporate clients and treasury, but also for our wealth clients.
The technology stretch isn't a big deal for us. It's more of a compliance-based issues that you would expect and
then, importantly, choosing the right partners that you would choose as a trading transfer platform and,
importantly, the custody platform. So that's an open and continuing dialogue here.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. The fintech comment got me to ask another question. If you think about some of the players, the bankers in
the industry, they're starting to set up bilateral relationships, even multilateral relationships with some big tech.
And that's an option versus going directly for the consumer especially with you going national now. Are you
looking to continue permanently with getting customers directly, or are you looking to partner more to lower your
customer acquisition cost and go more broadly, kind of like banking-as-a-service as a plan B?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We're going to get them directly. Look, I think when you effectively offer your products as the low-cost provider to
somebody else who owns the relationship, you've just sold – you sold your soul to the devil. It's the beginning of
the end of your franchise in whatever space you're playing. We need to own the customer relationship and we
need to deserve to own the customer relationship through an offering that doesn't need that fintech platform on
the front end.
It's the alternative to that, right. And this is – you've heard Jamie talk about this as well, if tech gets into the space
and owns client relationships, then we become a commodity provider industry with 5,000 participants. It's a
disaster. You can't default to that end game. You have to own the customer.

And when you think about the risk with data, to the extent customers – open banking and if customers opt-in to
share their data with other providers, does that force your hand more, or how do you defend against that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think there's a lot of appropriate focus on data. The CFPB, I know, is working on this as are various politicians
and other regulators. We need safety and soundness around data, that is the biggest systemic risk at the
moment, in my view. People talk about cyber but what they're really talking about is data and disruption of
account flows, payment flows because data is corrupted.
The consumer – that, by the way, is solved, ultimately through tokenized, API-based authorization at the bank for
what the consumer wants to share, not through screen scraping. And we're working our way towards that. I think
that's the ultimate end game. But the consumer has to be empowered to share data, but the data they want and to
share it when they want, not all the time and not everything, and not to places that are otherwise, in my view, not
regulated in terms of their controls around data.
