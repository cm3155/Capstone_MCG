Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Salvatore J. DiMartino
Executive Vice President & Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino. Thank you for joining the management team of New York
Community for today's conference call. Today's discussion of the company's second quarter 2022 results will be

Thomas Robert Cangemi
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter
2022 performance. First, however, I'd like to comment on our merger with Flagstar. Both sides are fully committed
to completing the transaction as soon as possible and we feel very good about where we stand currently. Over
the past 15 months, both companies have diligently worked together to get us to a strong position to close the
deal quickly once all regulatory approvals are received. We're excited about the benefits of the deal today as we
were when it was first announced. In addition to the both earnings per share and tangible value accretion, a
merger with Flagstar significantly improves our overall funding profile and interest rate sensitivity. [indiscernible]
(00:02:05) wholesale borrowings to being more significantly deposit funded and becoming asset sensitive as well.
In addition, it provides for both geographic and product diversification and accelerates our plan to transform our
business model to a more dynamic commercial bank model, driving strong financial performance and capital
generation. As for our second quarter results, we are extremely pleased with the company's strong operating
performance during the second quarter. By almost any measure, results exceeded expectations despite higher
interest rates and market volatility. We recorded record net income, another quarter of record deposit growth,
near record loan growth, record originations and a higher net interest margin and stable operating expenses while
asset quality remained stellar. These trends resulted in a solid year-over-year EPS growth. For the second
quarter of 2022, we reported operating dilutive EPS of $0.35 a share, up 6% compared to $0.33 a share for the
second quarter of 2022 and well ahead of the $0.32 analyst consensus.
Turning now to the details of our quarterly performance. One of the primary highlights of this quarter's operating
performance was our deposit growth. For the second consecutive quarter, deposits grew by approximately $3
billion. The growth continues to be driven by the banking-as-a-service initiative and loan related deposits. As I
have discussed previously, one of my top strategies, if not the top, is to increase the bank's focus on deposit
gathering and deemphasize our need for wholesale borrowings and other less traditional funding sources.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Longer term, [ph] our success executing on our (00:03:42) strategy will result in higher net interest margin. The
early results are quite positive. Since launching these initiatives early last year, total deposits have increased to
$41 billion, up $8.8 billion or 27%, while core deposits increased to $33 billion, up $11 billion or 50%. At the same
time, wholesale borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank advances, declined almost $2 billion or 11% to
$13.7 billion. During the current quarter, total deposits increased $3.3 billion and $6.2 billion through the first six
months of the year.
Our banking-as-a-service business was the biggest contributor to this growth. Banking-as-a-service deposits rose
$2.3 billion or 43% on a linked quarter basis and $5.8 billion year to date. Banking-as-a-Service deposits totaled
$7.8 billion at June 30, 2022, which is significant progress considering we started this business from scratch in the
first quarter of last year with virtually zero deposits. Our banking-as-a-service related deposits fall largely into
three categories: traditional BaaS, which primarily encompasses fintech-related deposits totaling $5.5 billion;
government banking as a service serving municipalities and eventually US Treasury's prepaid debit card program
totaling $652 million; and mortgage as a service catering to mortgage banking servicing companies and
consisting of escrow accounts [indiscernible] (00:05:10) $1.6 billion.
We also are having great success in garnering deposits from our loan customers. Total loan related deposits rose
just under $500 million during the second quarter to $4.9 billion, up 44% annualized on a linked quarter basis. For
the first six months of 2022, these deposits increased $921 million, far surpassing the $475 million we generated
for all of last year. All told, since we're focusing on this deposit source in the first quarter of last year, loan related
deposits have grown $1.4 billion, up about 40%.
Moving now to lending, we also had a very strong quarter in lending. Loan growth during the quarter was $1.8
billion, second only to the record $2.2 billion of loan growth we generated in the fourth quarter of last year. This
quarter's loan growth was driven by our multifamily portfolio where we continue to make market share gains as
competition abates along with heightened refinancing activity as market interest rates move higher during the
quarter forcing many borrowers to come to the table to refinance [indiscernible] (00:06:18) sooner rather than
later. At June 30, the multifamily portfolio was $36.8 billion, up $1 billion or 11% on an annualized basis compared
to the previous quarter, while the specialty finance portfolio totaled $4.1 billion, up $806 million on a linked quarter
basis or 24%.
It's important to note that we have approximately $6.8 billion of multifamily and CRE loans that come up on the
contractual maturity date and/or repricing between now and June 2024 with an average weighted coupon of
3.74%. [indiscernible] (00:06:52) loans at an average weighted coupon of 3.70% represents $5.3 billion of this
amount, while CRE loans at an average weighted coupon of 3.89% represents the remaining $1.5 billion.
The other driver was a significant growth in the specialty finance portfolio due primarily to high utilization rates. At
June 30, the specialty finance segment had total commitments of $6.6 billion of 16% compared to $5.7 billion at
March 31. Of the June amount, 75% or $5 billion of these commitments are structured as floating rate obligations
which have and will continue to benefit us in a rising rate environment.
Despite higher interest rates, we have had a record quarter for originations and our current pipeline looks very
good and we're heading to the third quarter. Loan origination set a new record as we originated $5.3 billion during
the second quarter, up 49% at the end of the previous quarter and up 72% compared to the second quarter of last
year. Second quarter originations far exceeded the prior quarter's pipeline by $2.8 billion, more than double last
quarter's $2.5 billion pipeline. Of the current quarter's originations, 37% were refinancing from our own portfolio,
39% were refinancing from other bank's portfolio, and 24% were related to property transactions. As for the

pipeline, the current pipeline heading into the third quarter of the year is a robust $2.5 billion on par with last
quarter. Of this amount, $1.8 billion or 72% of the pipeline was new money for the bank.
Moving now to asset quality. Our credit trends and asset quality remained stellar and continue to rank NYCB as
among the best in the industry. Non-performing assets totaled $56 million compared to $70 million last quarter
and were 9 basis points of total assets compared to 11 basis points last quarter. Early-stage delinquencies also
declined and principal-only loan deferrals were at a very manageable level, decreasing 51% from the prior quarter
to $139 million. In addition, we had $7 million of net recoveries this quarter compared to net charge-offs of $2
million from last quarter.
Before moving on to the next topic, I'd like to provide an update on the New York City real estate environment.
New York City residential real estate remains healthy and commercial real estate is improving gradually. Retail
prices across the three borrowers of Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan have reached new highs. This has been
due to low inventory and higher mortgage rates, which have pushed homebuyers to becoming renters. Medium
residential lands in Manhattan are above $4,000 for the second straight month, with rents continuing to make new
highs over the past five months.
In Brooklyn, the medium rent is $3,300, marking a new high for the borrower for the second straight month while
in Queens especially in northwest Queens, which is closer to the [indiscernible] (00:09:38) Manhattan, rents are
also at record highs. On the rent stabilized side, the Rent Guidelines Board approved rate hikes of 3.5% for one-
year leases and 5% for two-year leases beginning in the fourth quarter. These increases marked the largest
increase in almost a decade and will go a long way to offset some of the increases in operating costs. Office
leasing activity is showing signs of life of [ph] 3.5% (00:10:02) year-over-year with demand for Class A space up
32% on a year-over-year basis.
Moving now to the income statement. Second quarter net interest income totaled $359 million, up $28 million or
8% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact from prepayment income, net interest income on a non-
GAAP basis increased $35 million or 12% to $339 million on a year-over-year basis. Our pre-provision net
revenue was also very strong. Second quarter PPNR increased $31 million or 15% to $239 million on a year-over-
year basis. Excluding the impact from merger related expenses, PPNR grew $25 million or 11% to $243 million
year over year.
Moving next to the NIM. The NIM improved during the second quarter despite the Fed aggressively raising
interest rates several times to combat inflation. At 2.52%, the NIM was up 9 basis points sequentially. Excluding
the impact from prepayment income, the NIM was 2.38%, up 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and slightly
better than expectations. Given that Flagstar is significantly asset sensitive and we are liability sensitive, we are
very comfortable with the NIM on a pro forma basis. On a expense front, our non-interest expenses remain in
check, despite the company is continuing to invest in various businesses and hiring more people. Non-interest
expenses were $138 million for the second quarter, which includes $4 million of merger-related expenses.
Excluding this, operating expenses totaled $134 million, unchanged from the previous quarter and up only
modestly on a year-over-year basis.
Additionally, our efficiency ratio came in at 35.57% down compared to the both the prior year ago quarter, and this
level is well below the peer average of approximately 55%. As you can see, we had a broad-based strength
throughout the organization during the current quarter. This is all made possible by the hard work, dedication and
patience [indiscernible] (00:11:58) all our employees and [indiscernible] (00:12:00) them for helping the company
achieved the strong performance this quarter. At yesterday's meeting, the board of directors declared a $0.17

dividend on our common shares. The dividend will be paid on August 18 to common shareholders of record as of
August 8. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, this translates into an annualized dividend yield of 7.2%.
With that, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. We will do our very best to get to all of you
within time remaining, but if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or during the week. Operator, please
open the lines for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question today is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, Tom. So I guess a strong quarter from a loan growth [indiscernible] (00:13:08) standpoint. I think
you mentioned comfort with pro forma net interest margins. Maybe if we can just start there, give us a sense of
where you see the margin going based on the rate hikes we've had, the one we'll probably get this afternoon if we
think about NYCB stand-alone. And beyond – just how do we think about funding costs and deposit betas over
the next few quarters given all the actions you've taken to improve the deposit mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. So Ebrahim let me start off by saying we're super excited about the fact that we're getting close to our
engagement coming to a marriage with Flagstar. So hopefully as we get closer to our expectation of closing that
transaction, we look at an asset sensitive institution merging with a liability sensitive institution and we're very
positive about the outlook of the margin. That being said, I'll have Mr. Pinto go through some of the details on
where we think given the most recent changes of interest rates and how that would impact [indiscernible]
(00:14:06) company. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So when we look at the margin, we were very happy with the second quarter as it continued the expansion
of our margin that really has begun since the fourth quarter of 2019. And as Tom mentioned in his opening
remarks, the Flagstar deal does provide many benefits and one of them is combining an asset sensitive institution
into our liability sensitive balance sheet. So in order to illustrate this, we looked at the third quarter and if we
assumed that the Flagstar deal closed on July 1, we estimated what the net interest margin would look like
excluding prepayment fees and would come out to be approximately 2.68%. So there'll be a 30 basis point
increase to what we reported as margin ex prepay in the second quarter. When we look at the overall benefit,
would be about 45 basis points and what that entails is the 15 basis point reduction that we would on a stand-
alone basis expect to see in the third quarter. This assumes the 75 basis point increase later today and a 50 basis
point increase in September, which is what currently is consensus. And also it doesn't include any of the impacts

from purchase accounting as we believe that will be beneficial, but wouldn't be as material given the Flagstar
balance sheet which is primarily floating rate on the loan side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. So just a few follow-ups, John. For one, I think I caught in there 15 basis points stand-alone NIM
compression, 2.68% if the deal was closed as of July 1. So just want to make sure that's right. And why does
Flagstar not assume any margin expansion stand-alone? I think if I saw [indiscernible] (00:15:46) the NIM was
3.88% in June and the guidance is in 3.80% to 3.90% range, is there something one-off going on there or do we
expect the margin to kind of level off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think what John's saying is that the pro forma margin is anticipated to go up on a combined basis that includes
the assets of Flagstar merging into NYCB.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And if you look at to the investor presentation that Flagstar put out, they put out a range of 3.80% to 3.90%.
[indiscernible] (00:16:17) right, to come up with these numbers reusing the midpoint of that range. But you also
got to remember if you look at their presentation that they did put on a swap, do that has impact to the quarters as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
When we put the two companies together, that swap will get mark to market [ph] and removed (00:16:35), so that
the asset sensitive balance sheet that was – that Flagstar had back in December will be what we would have
going forward. So that's really I think the difference.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one separate question Tom, around the deal, obviously sounds like both are still very much on
board with the deal. Just give us an update in terms of where we are to the extent you can in terms of the OCC
application process and how realistic is an October 31 deal close timeline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So both teams are very confident. We filed our application right after we made the announcement. We made the
announcement in April that we were moving to the OCC. I believe in that mid-May, we filed the application and
waiting to hear back from both the OCC and the Fed and we feel pretty good about where we are, and we're very
focused on our closing date, hopefully within that period. We have an October deadline in contract that we're
pushing forward to get the closing done. As far as the teams are concerned, everyone's working on a daily basis.

It's been a very long engagement. We're looking forward to the marriage and hopefully, that'll happen within that
timeframe. Nothing more I can say as far as specificity around the process other than it's in the hands of the
regulators.

Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steven. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good. I wanted to start off with a theoretical question, maybe for John. If we assume the deal closed and these
two banks came together – color you just gave to Ebrahim's question was helpful. But once these two banks are
together, for every 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate, what do you expect your NIM to do?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
On a consolidated basis, what we would expect is that we will no longer be, of course, as liability sensitive as we
are today. We'll be neutral to slightly asset sensitive. So we would expect an increase going forward to the
margin. But that depends on market conditions and of course, the rate increases at the time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Steven, I would just add to that point is that we're going to be in a very unique position given the Fed [ph]
pivot (00:18:39) on interest rates and our ability to look at this combined company, positioning it best going
forward on the [ph] balance sheet (00:18:45) perspective. So if you think about liabilities, for example, when we
started this process of merging with Flagstar, our liabilities were substantially out of the money. In this
environment, we are probably par to slightly in the money, so we have tremendous flexibility of exiting what we
call wholesale liabilities and use that opportunity to better position the bank for the long term on the proper
funding mechanism on a combined basis. As you know, I've been very public about this, we're focusing on
gathering better liabilities to fund ourselves more [ph] commercial bank like (00:19:15). The marketplace right now
will give us a great opportunity if we have [ph] balance sheet (00:19:21) positioning opportunity. So we feel highly

confident that when we come together, we will look at the balance sheet very carefully and focus on how we can
position ourselves best to generate shareholder returns going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So basically what you're saying Tom is when the banks come together, we should think of you as being maybe
neutral to very slightly asset sensitive, but over time you plan to remix the balance sheet, make yourself a bit
more asset sensitive but that's not going to be the case day 1. That's basically the message, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think day 1, we're focusing on neutral to asset sensitive and we'll get there with the flexibility of repositioning. I
want to make this statement very clear, the liability base is now significantly closer to par and/or in the money.
That means a year ago, that substantial record out of the money liability position has changed in value because of
the market condition. That gives us a lot of flexibility to figure out how we're going to fund this institution without
taking consequences to capital, to restructure. So this gives us more options to think about where the balance
sheet is going forward. As far as the lines of businesses, I think Mr. Pinto was very clear. They have no free
floating rate, so there's not really a lot of negative marks that would be involved in their positioning because it's
mostly floating rate type of investments and loans. So we have some good flexibility there on the funding side.
At the same time, we're going to look at our asset classes and focus on the verticals and put the bank in a
position to benefit from the current market, which is obviously in a rising rate environment. Now, obviously, in the
long run, we want to be more commercial bank [ph] like [indiscernible] (00:20:51), that'll take time but the focus is
the focus on funding for the bank based on loan-related deposits. The company has done a tremendous job. The
passion here is that when we make a loan, we get the deposit balances. [indiscernible] (00:21:03) loan, that's a
cultural change in NYCB and we've done some great progress there. That is going to be the focus going forward
on a combined basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's helpful. And then final question. So if we look at the banking-as-a-service deposits, can you talk about – I'm
trying to understand how these are changing your liability sensitive profile stand-alone or not. So can you talk
about the cost of those deposits [indiscernible] (00:21:32) strong growth, particularly the fintech bucket in the
quarter? What did you pay for those deposits in the quarter? And are these changing your liability sensitive profile
or are you just replacing expensive wholesale funds with basically market rate banking-as-a-service deposits in
the fintech bucket? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, Steven, it's a combination of a lot of unique attributes here. There's really three functions here. So if you
think about Flagstar, they are one of the top originators in the country, number six in origination, number five in
servicing. We're building our banking as a service in the mortgage side. We feel highly confident that when we
merge together, that could be a substantial business on a combined basis. They have lack of a need for certain
liabilities given their structure. We have a desire to bring in lots of liabilities. So the banking as a service [ph] tied
to mortgage clearly is market. It is what it is, it's market (00:22:18). And if you have a custodial relationship, it's
close to zero. If you don't, you work with the customer, you have a lending relationship. You could work out
relationships in respect to reasonable funding, and it's going to be cheaper than home loan banking advances.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
So, yes, it does have a cost, but we believe it's more attractive than home loan bank advances and other
wholesale type liabilities.
When you focus on the government side, which again hasn't really kicked in yet but we have tremendous
contracts in the work, we run the Department of New Jersey, that's one of the few contracts that are currently in
the pipeline that we're getting benefit from currently. Rhode Island Department of Labor, Rhode Island
Department of Health, the US Treasury Department which is a substantial potential benefit for this company,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Commonwealth of Virginia, these are all wins for the bank. These roll out over
time and the cost of those deposits was zero. And when that starts to kick in going forward, that's going to be a
significant catalyst to our funding position as your cost funding.
Now this takes time to onboard. And I don't want to get ahead of myself as far as giving you guidance on when
these kick in. But we believe over the next 12 to 24 months, this will be a very sizable piece of our business. In
addition, we also share in fees. So in addition to having a zero cost deposit liability and a tremendous opportunity
to get our My Banking Direct brand out there within the marketplace, we also get a sharing of fees and a
tremendous benefit on floats. The area on the digital side, we call it [indiscernible] (00:23:47) fintech relationships.
So we've been very proactive not only to just bank the client and be a [indiscernible] (00:23:55) for their services,
but also focus on corporate type accounts that we can now bank their relationships. So we're working some
fabulous headwinds into that particular area, but most importantly, we're seeing results. Now, this is [indiscernible]
(00:24:10) short-term interest rates. Mr. Pinto didn't get through the specific details, but each deal had its own
structure and was very proactive on building this out over time. We believe there's a need for a bank of our size to
compete against some of the smaller players that are taking the banking-as-a-service business model, and we
feel this has been a very good ramp-up for the company as an alternative funding solution than a traditional home
loan bank advanced market and non-traditional wholesale funding to focus on a diversified deposit needs. So,
John, if you want to maybe talk about the funding side as far as cost of those types of liabilities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Excluding the government piece that Tom talked about, when you're looking at the mortgage-as-a-service
[ph] or certainly (00:24:48) the banking-as-a-service transactions, they're primarily tied to effective Fed funds plus
or minus spread, a small spread usually either way. So they are tied to short-term interest rates, but as Tom
mentioned, there's still a more effective funding source than the home loan bank, given the inefficiencies
potentially in that market. So they are just specifically tied normally to effective Fed funds.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, plus or minus. I think Steven, one of the attribute of this is very interesting that as we work with these
clients and look at opportunities in the banking side, we also work with excess liquidity coming off of their actual
products that they're selling in the marketplace. So money comes in and out, those are all operating accounts
[indiscernible] (00:25:31) very nicely for the bank. So we're looking at it not only as just a BAAS relationship, but
as a commercial bank relationship as well. And that's been very, very positive for past six months.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. John and Tom, can you talk about liquidity and access to liquidity going forward? And
then also [ph] maybe mention (00:25:59) Flagstar, they mentioned their drop in liquidity ratio from March to June.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
From a liquidity perspective, what we've been doing – we're in a better spot now than we've been historically,
especially when you look at on balance sheet liquidity and even some of the cash balances and unencumbered
securities that we've been holding on the books. So, as we continue to pay down home loan bank borrowings, our
liquidity by bringing in deposits just continues to increase. So, we're very comfortable with the liquidity levels that
we have. You can see we're keeping a little extra cash on the balance sheet to be conservative as we bring in
these banking-as-a-service customers just to ensure that we fully understand the duration related to them. We
don't have any surprises. So that's why you're seeing some heightened cash and unencumbered securities on our
balance sheet, which will continue as we continue to bring in deposits and pay down wholesale borrowing. So
from the liquidity side, it's – we feel very confident where we stand now. And the potential to bring in more
deposits as we go forward only enhances that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Chris, I would add to John's commentary that we've been very conservative on putting the cash to work.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We've been waiting on the sidelines given this environment, short-term liquidity to be invested [indiscernible]
(00:27:09) spread right now, which is advantageous to the bank. So we've been very cautious there. So we're
looking forward as we have excess liquidity, even with short-term treasuries, [ph] we can make a spread in that
excess (00:27:17).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on Flagstar, should we think a bit less about where the ratios are at
[indiscernible] (00:27:25) and more about kind of what you will do with it together because you have a lot of
optionality as [indiscernible] (00:27:30)?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Absolutely – I agree. Absolutely. Yes. We're getting closer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hopefully we'll get to the finish line. And clearly, this is going to be very opportunistic when we look at the choices
of the balance sheet on a combined basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And one quick one on prepayments. Any visibility to them staying high for Q3?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:27:52) some commentary about the mortgage market in our backyard. We've had elevated
levels, and the second quarter was better than the first quarter. We see the continuation of that. So we're very
bullish about activity. There's pent-up refi opportunity. There really is a lot of customers that need to come to the
table here given they're coming off of low 3s, market's close to 5% now. So I believe that will accelerate
prepayment activity. We see good visibility right now. We're seeing – we're going through July. We have some
good levels in already. So I would say still continue with a positive trend. But we feel we can go much higher from
here if rates continue to trek higher here.
Now, obviously, if it goes the other way, they may wait on the sidelines. But we have a decent amount of loans
coming due in the next two years and need to make a decision. And all of those coupons are out of the money.
So they would have to pay up to get either just a modification and/or refi. And we're being very selective on what
we want to do going forward. We feel that in this environment, our conservative underwriting standards is key.
And the fact that turning the coupon for us is more viable than focusing on explosive growth. The growth that we
have this year for the first half was significantly front loaded. I believe if you think about the rest of the year, our
goal here is [ph] to turn to (00:29:07) coupon. We'll have some moderate growth for the rest of the second half of
the year and we'll still be well above what we'll say at least meet our expectations of high single-digit net loan
growth.
Last year that growth was back loaded. This year it seems like it was front loaded. So we're confident that we'll
meet our goals and objectives of that high single-digit net loan growth number. And we also are focusing very
carefully on turning the coupon [indiscernible] (00:29:28) low 5s, that's very meaningful for the margin going
forward.

Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Moss from B. Riley Securities. Your line is now live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe going back to the banking-as-a-service deposits here, look like that was backend weighted
for the quarter. Curious if that's primarily due to your [ph] circle (00:29:58) relationship that you announced late in
the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I believe that's part of it. It's about that particular relationship with a global stablecoin exchange company
[indiscernible] (00:30:07) just under $3 billion. So the rest is other technology companies on the tax side. I did
break it out in my prepared remarks. So on the tech side of that amount, I think it was $5.5 billion, $2.8 billion is
where we're focusing on stablecoin exchange. And that's for their liquidity requirements on their cash
expectations. And we're one of six banks that service that relationship.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of – on liability side here, curious on a stand-alone basis, you guys have
got, I think, $7.5 million or so [indiscernible] (00:30:47) that come due – that could come due six months, curious
what are your thoughts on how you're going to fund them [indiscernible] (00:30:54) near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So look, I think this goes into the commentary that I discussed about the pro forma balance sheet.
Optionality is on the table here to look at the liability base and the asset base upon consolidation of these two
businesses coming together and the flexibility of something that's either in the money [indiscernible] (00:31:13)
without any consequences, so that gives us lots of flexibility. So what we've been doing in the short term, we've
been either refinancing [indiscernible] (00:31:21) from our prepared remarks, we're down $2 billion for the first six
months and reducing our wholesale dependency on the home loan bank system. That is a focus of the bank. So
clearly having that [ph] portable (00:31:33) position right now – at a position that we could be flexible and look at
the balance sheet on a go-forward basis, we look at that as an opportunity. Clearly, if we continue to see deposit
growth, which we believe we will, we have a significant amount of other initiatives working into Q3 and beyond.
We're not going to give guidance on deposit growth, but we're still doing a lot of hard work and bringing in new
depository relationships, both on the BaaS side as well as loan related. And that will also be a catalyst to deal with
advances as they get put back to us.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then one more question on the liability side with CDs. Curious, what is in the bucket to re-price this
quarter, at what rate and maybe just trying to figure out what is the dynamic [audio gap] (00:32:19) portfolio in
terms of like the average duration?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. So if you'll look at [indiscernible] (00:32:25) couple of different pieces. So if you look at our maturing CDs in
the third quarter, it's $3.6 billion and that's about a 50 basis point rate. So we've had a really good quarter in the
second quarter with retention of our CDs. So when you look at our current CD rates of nine months, is about 1%;
12 months, 1.75%; two years is around 2%, give or take. So we brought in money under 1% in the second
quarter. It will be up a little of course in the third, but we don't think it will be dramatically higher than that given
what we've seen so far this quarter and that the September [indiscernible] (00:33:06) happens so late in
September. When you look on the borrowing side, you mentioned the puttables, what our thoughts are there, it's
only about $575 million of wholesale borrowings that are actually maturing in the quarter and that's at a 1.81%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Hey. Good morning. So my first question is on loan growth. You had solid loan growth during the quarter. In
your prepared remarks, you noted the multifamily portfolio. You continue to gain market share as competition
abates. I was wondering first if you could talk to the competitive environment and what you're seeing there. And
then just any color on the rebound in specialty finance? And then just on CRE [indiscernible] (00:33:56) hasn't
been growing there for some time. Just anything might be keeping you cautious there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So I'd say big picture, we're a conservative underwriting shop. We're very focused on continuing holding to
our standards of conservatism. So going forward and then part of our culture is that we underwrite on a cash flow
basis. And if deals are tightened or they don't make sense, they'll leave the portfolio, and we're very comfortable

with that. And that's our philosophy. We feel very good about the loan book or LTVs, the business in hand and the
New York City marketplace. And we're also working with some of our flagship customers that are moving outside
of New York and building out their businesses away from New York City. And that's been very successful. And at
the same time, as we move with them, we're also working very hard to bring in the full depository relationships. So
that's been a success for the bank.
And historically, the bank has always had a focus on strong underwriting criteria. When you think about the
marketplace today, we are focusing on obviously moving the coupon higher, being very selective on
[indiscernible] (00:34:56) retail and office. So you don't really see a whole lot of activity there for years now. We've
been not focused on that. From time to time, we have good customer relationships that have a diversified portfolio
and we'll consider financing it. But the focus has been in our niche business, being the multifamily, non-luxury
marketplace. And we've done a very strong job over the past 18 months on getting back to a growth story. With
that being said, I would say, in my prepared remarks, we had interesting back-loaded growth last year. It was slow
in the beginning of 2021, and at the end of 2021, we had a surge of activity given the shift of interest rates, that
continued into the first half of 2022. And we think that was a front-loaded story. With that being said, I feel very
confident that we'll meet our target of high single-digit net loan growth for the company on both multifamily as well
as specialty finance. On specialty finance, we had a couple of years of uncertainty on utilization given the general
economy, COVID and the supply chain issues. That seems like that has changed quite a bit for us. So a lot of that
has been drawdowns.
The good news there is that these are well underwritten credits that we're very comfortable with. And more
importantly, they're committed for any drawdown and we get nice returns [indiscernible] (00:36:12) 75% of that
book is floating rate and that's been an explosive six months. I don't want to envision that same type of activity for
the second half of this year. But I think specialty finance even in a flat scenario had a phenomenal year. It'll
probably grow a little bit this year but on a managed perspective. And I think the target for the company is high
single-digit net loan growth with the focus on really moving the coupons within the portfolio and we're focusing
very actively on that bucket of loans that are coming due to reprice and their option comes due. And we're being
creative there to get them to the table sooner so they can move that low 3% coupon into our high 4%, low 5%
coupon and that will add value to the margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. If I could just one more question. This is for Flagstar. So I know the gain on loan sale was $27
million in 2Q and I believe in the deck, you're guiding flat in 3Q. I know a few quarters ago, there was guidance on
the expected EBO gain on sales. And just want to get an update on how much you had in the first half of this year.
Any expectations for the second half? And just wondering if these kind of finish and they'll be done by this year or
if any of that spills into 2023?

Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So in the second quarter, we had – just under $1 million EBO gain. What I would tell you is, as we
move forward, the EBO gains are going to be relatively neutral. You might get a little bit similar to Q2, but it isn't
going to make a meaningful difference to the quarter's gain on sale. And with the rising rate environment, that's
because you can't securitize them all at a gain. And so, those that were securitizing at a gain in some instances
are being offset by those that are under water. And so, we've made the decision in certain instances to just keep
them on the balance sheet in portfolio. So net-net, you're not going to see a big impact from EBO as it relates to
the gain on sale going forward.

Okay. Outside of the partnership with Circle, do you have any other stablecoin relationships that we should be
aware of? And just given some of the disruption in that market, could you just talk to the quality of those
relationships, if you do have others and some of the dynamics of how they keep the stablecoin stable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we have none other than the one that you've mentioned. We're very confident in [indiscernible] (00:39:50)
positioning as a global exchange [indiscernible] (00:39:55). As indicated, we are a cash provider for – obviously,
one of six banks that holds cash for their liquidity requirements. It's not focused on a combined basis where we're
co-mingled. It's clearly just a cash positioning and we're one of those – one of the six banks that provides banking
services to them to have a percentage of their allocation to cash. I believe if you recall there were liquidity
requirements, 30% of every dollar that need to invest – needs to be invested in cash. And I believe the other 70%
is in short-term treasury. So USDC happens to be obviously one of the most stable stablecoins. We're very
comfortable with that relationship and we're working on a number of initiatives in respect to potential partners in
the future. But clearly, when it comes to our positioning, it's really just the corporate cash account that we have
with our partnership there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Great. Okay. The last one for me is just to get a temperature check on obtaining regulatory approval for the
deal. From a corporate structure standpoint, the Flagstar deal has a few moving pieces, one of which is Flagstar
seeking a national bank charter within the OCC versus an FSA. I'm curious if any critical milestones at this point
have been reached and approved and if you can speak to any of them, including that national bank charter
switch?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:41:21) Obviously, we believe [indiscernible] (00:41:25) just clarify saying we feel very confident
where we are. As indicated, we filed our application in mid-May. We're coming to the end of July and things are
progressing, but I'll push that over to Sandro. Sandro?

Yeah. Thank you, Tom. No, I don't have anything to add relative to the regulatory status. We're working through
the process. And as Tom said, we remain confident that we'll get the approvals we need. As it relates to the
national bank piece of it, so Flagstar, we've been considering moving to a national charter since that option
became available to us a couple of years ago when Congress passed a bill that included that provision. And it's
just sensible to do it in parallel with this application. So there's – don't read anything into the national bank piece
of it. It's just an easy way to get there. And we would have gone there – if we were independent, we would have
gone there because we're not as thrift like as we used to be. And as you think about that going forward, the
national bank charter just makes a lot more sense for our organization and for the combined organization as well.
So again, don't read anything into that. There's no complication associated with the application because of the
national bank piece of it.

That's great. And then did you provide like you typically do, the expectation for expenses for the quarter? Sorry, I
may have missed that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. [ph] 135 (00:43:29) very consistent where we were in the second quarter and the first quarter. We're
comfortable with our original guidance in that [ph] 540 (00:43:37) range. We beat it by a little bit in the first two
quarters. We think, we'll be there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the last one, given the market's expectation that we're in some sort of a slowdown in the
economy. Can you just speak to what you think as normalized losses for that [indiscernible] (00:43:55) book given
some of the cyclicality there? Thanks.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So just in general, I mean we haven't had a 30-day delinquency in nine years. So we're pretty confident on
underwriting. And then we're a credit [ph] buyout shot (00:44:08) there. We do a great job on sourcing through
what makes sense for the bank going forward. It is a unique business model for us. It doesn't come with funding,
but we are focused on the credit side. So we have not had a 30-day delinquency in nine years. And so we don't
envision any real losses there. But maybe John can specifically talk about on [indiscernible] (00:44:28)
perspective how that would kick in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, even from a [indiscernible] (00:44:31) perspective where the modeling comes out, very low losses
historically and currently given what we've seen. I mean there's just so the collateral on it is just so strong. The
performance has been so strong as well. So the risk ratings on that portfolio are extremely low. So it's a very, very
high credit portfolio that we've built over the last almost 10 years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, [indiscernible] (00:44:57) secure, looking forward to the repricing of it. Obviously, we managed it for the
past decade in the low interest rate environment and this elevated interest rate environment on the short end of
the [indiscernible] (00:45:06) some good benefits on the yield side there.
