Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me always are Dave
Dykstra, Dave Stoehr, Kate Boege, Tim Crane, and Rich Murphy. We'll have the same format as we usually – as
we adopted earlier in the year, seems to go pretty well. I'll give some general comments regarding our results;
turn it over to Tim for more detail on the balance sheet; turn it over to Dave Dykstra who's going to talk about
other income and expense; and Murph will then follow up with the discussion on credit; then back to me for some
summary comments about the future; and then time for questions.
As many of you already know, December 27, 2021 marked the 30th anniversary of us opening our first bank. Little
more than $6 million in capital raised from friends, neighbors, and family, 11 hardy souls embarked on the journey
with absolutely no delusions of grandeur. Our goal was simple: to create a new type of community bank, one that
combined high touch banking with technology, i.e., high tech high touch, to our people and businesses in the
communities we serve. All along at the center of our homegrown – all along, the center of our homegrown culture
in four pillars: our shareholders, employees, customers, and communities we serve. We never wavered from that
commitment in the 30 years we've been in existence.
Of course, this anniversary, I've been asked many times what I'm most proud of about Wintrust. Is it the 5,400
employees who make up Wintrust? Yeah, I'm pretty proud of that. Is it the $50 billion in banking assets and $35
billion of wealth management assets we've amassed over the years? Yeah, I'm pretty proud of that, too. Is it the
record earnings we have delivered over the years? Yes. In fact, our stock price quote – is it the fact that out stock
price quote the century mark? Feel pretty good about that, too. Many of those attributes, I am very proud of.
However, the one I'm most proud of is the fact our culture has endured over that period. Culture dedicated doing
the right thing for our constituents all the time. Take the blame, share the fame, and avoid the shame, and enjoy
the game. Our culture in a nutshell. Have endured even though we have grown beyond our wildest dreams. So,
enough with the walk down memory lane. Let's talk about the quarter and year-to-date results.
All in all, another very successful quarter. Previous calls, I referred to around as $1 billion quarters. This one is
different, it's a $2 billion quarter. Assets rose $2.3 billion to $50.14 billion, 7.2% growth or $5.1 billion versus
December 31, 2020. Core loans net of PPP and loans held for sale went to $34.2 billion, $2 billion for the quarter,
16.6% growth or about $5 billion – $4.9 billion. Deposits were $42 billion, a $2.1 billion growth for the quarter,
13.5% or $5.2 billion up to December 31, 2020.
Loan growth was enhanced by the purchase of portfolio of agency loans from Allstate, approximately $550 million.
Tim will talk about this a little bit more. On the balance sheet front, our strategy, which we adopted the start of the
pandemic in April 2020 of growing through the period and enhancing our interest rates in today's position, has
paid off in spades. Mortgage and PPP loans took us through the depth of the pandemic. Our growth in core loans
has more than replaced the earnings power. These assets are extremely well positioned for higher rates. They
appear to be here, finally.
[ph] Paul Harvey (00:05:33), page 2 (sic) [4]. On the earnings front, we recorded record year, $466 million or
$7.58 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter recorded income, $99 million or $1.58 per diluted common share,
[indiscernible] (00:05:49) from the third quarter, mainly because of the positive position – provision, $9.3 million,
as opposed to the negative provision of almost $8 million. Positive provision was brought about by the acquisition,
the double accounting we have to do there, and the fact that our growth loans have grown so nicely.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Net income interest income was up $8.5 million compared to Q3. Core net interest income is up $15.5 million, and
it appears the PPP contribution was down $7 million. Earning asset, well, basically loan levels, the 5-basis-point
decline in deposit costs was a modest change. Loan pipelines remain consistently strong whilst we start 2022.
The nice head start is ending loan balances to December average loans, about $1.36 billion.
Line utilization was up a smidge. That's kind of – a smidge is a technical term we use around here, but not close
to historical averages. But we'll discuss it – Murph will talk about this in detail. I mean, there's over $1 billion of
loan growth if and when utilization return to normal. NIM was down slightly, 4 basis points, due to its additional
liquidity. [indiscernible] (00:07:02) you can expect us to begin vesting our excess liquidity. Current duration on our
liquidity portfolio is a little over three years, opposed to a normal six-plus years. We'll be prudent in our investment
timing, though.
Credit quality got even better, believe it or not. Murph will also cover this in his review of credit. However, I'll note
that we did conduct an asset sale noted in the release. [ph] If we needed to call (00:07:25) the portfolio and get rid
of bad assets, potentially bad assets as soon as possible. PTPP, pre-tax pre-provision income was up
approximately $5 million to $146.3 million. We expect [indiscernible] (00:07:37) to grow nicely in 2022, especially
when rates rise is anticipated. More on this in my closing remarks.
One last point I want to make is our wealth management business. Assets under administration were up almost
$1 billion in the quarter, approximately $5.5 billion in the year-over-year, to $35.5 billion or 18% growth rate. As
we see the market, obviously has done a good core growth and account – and our account total is impressive.
Fee run rates went from an annualized $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, [ph] $130 million (00:08:10) in
the fourth quarter of 2020. Yeah, you got it.
I feel like Joe Biden there. Tim's now going to talk for two hours. Very proud of the progress made in this year.
Look forward to a continued growth in this area, got a lot of momentum there. I'll turn it over to Tim who'll take us
through the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Ed. I'd like to highlight a couple of balance sheet items, as well as comment on a couple items
likely to be of interest. The $2 billion in loan growth that Ed referenced was spread nicely across all categories.
Rich will add some color to that, but it includes the $578 million of loans from the previously announced
November purchase of the Allstate agency loans. This portfolio is a very nice add to our existing agency lending
business. Importantly, unlike some loan portfolio purchases that run off over time, this is a business that we
believe we can continue to sustain and grow.
It's also important to note that the overall loan growth does not yet include much benefit from increased line
utilization where we only saw a modest improvement in the quarter. On an annualized basis, the loan growth for
the quarter excluding the portfolio purchase and PPP was 18%, the third straight quarter at or above 15%; and Ed
mentioned that the period end loan balances were well above the quarter average balances. Obviously, PPP
loans continue to run off down a little over a $0.5 billion in the quarter and now total $558 million, a number we
expect to decline relatively quickly with continued forgiveness activity.
Into 2022, we expect continued strong loan growth. While our guidance remains our historical mid-to-high single
digit loan growth on a percentage basis, net of PPP, our short-term performance should continue to be at or
above the high end of that range and likely better than peers. The $2 billion of deposit growth, just under half of
that was non-interest-bearing deposits and the rest at very low cost. As a result, interest-bearing deposit costs
4

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
declined to 24 basis points. While we believe there is some continued room for decline, the changes will be
smaller going forward as the majority of deposits have repriced during the low rate cycle.
On the investment front, we remained very liquid with approximately $6.1 billion in liquidity at year end, and
securities balance is essentially flat. While I expect we will begin to deploy some of the liquidity in the first part of
2022 at somewhat higher rates than we saw in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious about locking in low long-
term yields and remain very well-positioned for rates at higher levels. On that topic, anticipating a question or two
about rising rates, we've reported for several quarters that we have focused on remaining interest rate sensitive,
expecting the possibility of higher rates. That continues to be the case and we will benefit from upward changes
that the market is starting to price into the consensus forward curves.
Just a couple of highlights reinforcing Ed's earlier comments. Approximately 80% of our loans reprice within a
year. You can see this on page 12 of the supplemental presentation. Our spreads, simply our loan yields versus
our deposit costs, improved for the third straight quarter. Securities yields for many instruments are 20 to 50 basis
points, higher than they were even a month ago. And while it's slightly more complicated than this, given loan
floors, loan indices, deposit data, and some competitor actions, we believe each 25-basis-point change in rates is
worth about $40 million to $50 million in pre-tax net interest income on an annualized basis, and you'll see this in
a paragraph on the second page of our press release.
The only thing that I would add is that, early in the cycle, deposit costs tend not to rise as rapidly as they may
following subsequent later increases. You can obviously do the math, but our net interest margin for the quarter
was down 4 basis points attributed solely to the continued impact of more liquidity. Absent that excess liquidity,
our margin would have actually expanded by 2 basis points.
Without large continued inflows, we expect the margin has bottomed and will certainly improve as rates begin to
trend up. Going forward, each 25-basis-point increase in rates equates to approximately a 10-basis-point
improvement in margin. And if – and that's a big if – the current consensus rate forecast plays out, it's conceivable
margin will be around 3% at year-end.
On the capital front, the bank's capital levels are down slightly as a result of the strong growth in the quarter, but
remain well within our targeted levels and appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis. Lastly, we continue to be very
pleased by our market momentum. Last quarter, we highlighted the favorable Greenwich ratings and the
satisfaction of our commercial clients. I would add that Wintrust ended 2021 as the top SBA lender in Illinois. In
terms of customer behavior, we continue to see digital usage increase nicely. And in 2022, we will continue to
improve on our digital offerings with a near total revamp of our consumer and small business digital services.
In addition to our high tech improvements, we will also enhance our high touch activities with the addition of
locations in Oak Park, Illinois and Rockford, Illinois, both attractive markets where Wintrust historically has had a
limited presence. As you can tell, we feel very good about where we begin 2022.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave.

David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. I'll cover the noteworthy income statement categories, starting with the net interest income.
Some redundancy within Tim's comments here, but we'll just go through it quickly. For the fourth quarter of 2021,
net interest income totaled $296 million, an increase of $8.5 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021 and
an increase of $36.6 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
The $8.5 million increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter was primarily
due to average earning asset growth, which was up 17.4% on an annualized basis over the prior quarter. Net
interest margin declined 4 basis points to 255 basis points; a beneficial decline of 6 basis points for the rates paid
on liabilities was offset by a 7-basis-point decline on the yield on earning assets and a 3-basis-point decline in the
net free funds contribution, resulting in the decline in the reported net interest margin.
The yield on earning asset decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, as Tim said, was almost
entirely due to the short-term liquidity build that we had during the quarter. And the decline in the interest-bearing
liability rate was primarily associated with a 5-basis-point decline in our interest-bearing deposits, mostly due to
the repricing of time deposits. It's important to note that the net interest income expanded despite the $7 million
less of interest income associated with the PPP portfolio in the fourth quarter, and the net interest margin would
have stayed relatively stable, excluding the impact of the PPP portfolio and would be down only 1 basis point.
As Tim Crane mentioned, the margin was affected by this excess liquidity on our balance sheet and that the rates
are higher than they were a month ago. So as we begin to deploy some of that liquidity into the market, we expect
the net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from that, although we'll continue to be cautious on
deploying the liquidity.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $9.3 million, compared
to a negative provision of $7.9 million in the prior quarter, and a $1.2 million provision expense recorded in the
year ago quarter. The provision expense in the fourth quarter was driven largely by loan growth, excluding PPP
loans of approximately $2.0 billion, including loans related to the acquisition of the insurance agency lending
portfolio and also increased slightly due to a small rise in net charge-offs. Offsets to those increases for the
provision were improvements in the macroeconomic environment and in the loan portfolio characteristics during
the quarter, including improving loan risk rating migration. Rich will cover credit quality and additional detail on just
a couple of minutes.
Turning to the other non-interest income and non-interest expense sections. In the non-interest income portion of
the income statement, our wealth management revenue increased $1 million to another record level of $32.5
million in the fourth quarter, compared to $31.5 million in the third quarter, and up 21% from the $26.8 million
recorded in the year ago quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue saw a reasonably solid loan origination volume during the fourth quarter with lock
adjusted origination volumes down approximately 22%, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in
our prior quarter's earnings release. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $2.7 million to $53.1 million in the
fourth quarter.
Revenue was lower in the current quarter, primarily due to the lower lock adjusted origination volume and
combined with slight compression in the related production margin. The lower production revenue was partially
offset by a favorable fair value adjustment of mortgage servicing rights. The company recorded a positive $6.7
million valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to mortgage servicing rights, compared to a
decrease of $888,000 in the prior quarter.
Looking forward, based on current market conditions, we anticipate mortgage revenue, excluding any MSR
valuation adjustments, to be fairly similar in the first quarter of 2022, as we experienced in the fourth quarter of
2021. Obviously, the mortgage servicing rights valuation is tied closely to interest rates, and we're not going to

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
speculate on what those may be at the end of the first quarter of 2022. But based on current market rate
conditions, it would point to a higher valuation. But obviously, lots of time to go yet in the quarter.
Other non-interest income totaled $18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, down approximately $4.5 million
from the $23.4 million recorded in the prior quarter. The two primary reasons for the lower revenue in this
category include $1.3 million of lower swap fee revenue and $3.7 million of lower income from investments and
partnerships, which are primarily related to investments that we have to support our CRE purposes.
In the non-interest expense categories, non-interest expense stayed relatively stable with the past five quarters
and totaled $283.4 million in the fourth quarter, up approximately $1.3 million from the $282.1 million recorded in
the prior quarter. There are a handful of categories that account for the majority of the change from the prior
quarter that I'll focus on, but I think it's important to put the expense growth in the context of the company growing
its balance sheet by $2.3 billion during the quarter.
Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the
third quarter of the year. The decline is primarily related to a $7.1 million of lower compensation expense
associated with mortgage banking commissions and incentive compensation program expense in the fourth
quarter relative to the third quarter, with those savings partially offset by increased staffing costs as the company
continues to grow.
Software and equipment expense totaled $23.7 million in the fourth quarter. That was an increase of $1.7 million
as compared to the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the
reduction in the useful life of certain software that is planned to be replaced as we continue to upgrade our digital
customer experience, as well as increased expenses associated with upgrading our data centers and other
software enhancements to support our growth, ongoing digital enhancements and cybersecurity efforts.
OREO expenses were actually negative by approximately $641,000 in the fourth quarter as the company
recorded gains of approximately $843,000 on sales of OREO properties. These gains were in amounts that
exceeded the aggregate cost of the OREO expenses and valuation charges on other OREO properties. Although
this expense category was negative, it was approximately $890,000 less negative than the third quarter, which
also had gains on the sale of OREO properties. I think it's important to note that we've been aggressive in
liquidating OREO assets and the amount of OREO on our balance sheet at the end of the year was a mere $4.3
million compared to $13.8 million at the end of the prior quarter and $16.6 million at the end of 2020.
Other than the expense categories I just discussed, no other expense category had a change of more than
$900,000, and all those other expense categories in the aggregate were up less than $2.5 million compared to the
third quarter of 2021.
The net overhead ratio, a measure of operational efficiency, remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter
relative to the third quarter. The net overhead ratio stood at 1.21%, which is down 1 basis point from the 1.22%
recorded in the third quarter. And the ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and good
mortgage banking results. The efficiency ratio also stayed relatively stable at approximately 66% in both the third
and the fourth quarters of the year.
So in summary, the core fundamentals are strong, with growth in pre-tax pre-provision net income, robust loan
and deposit growth, increased net interest income despite sizable PPP loan reductions. Another record wealth
management revenue quarter, seasonally adjusted strong mortgage banking revenues, relatively stable net
overhead and efficiency ratios, strong pipelines and fantastic credit metrics.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Rich.

Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance for the fourth quarter was very solid from a number of
perspectives. As detailed on slide 5 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter, net of PPP, was just over $2 billion.
As Tim noted, that number included the Allstate portfolio acquisition of $578 million, resulting in net loan growth of
over $1.4 billion. Equally as important and similar to the third quarter was the nature of this growth, which was
spread across our loan portfolio, specifically Wintrust Life loans which were up $387 million; core C&I loans which
were up $392 million; FIRST Insurance Funding which was up $239 million. In addition, the asset-based lending
group, leasing and franchise teams all showed solid growth.
This quarter's growth closed out a very productive year for Wintrust, where we saw net loan growth, excluding
PPP, of $4.9 billion; $4.3 billion if you net out the Allstate acquisition, an increase of 14.6% for the year.
As noted in prior earnings calls, we continue to see very solid momentum in our core C&I portfolio. Pipelines have
been strong throughout the year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings during the past two
quarters. We continue to believe that ongoing market disruption and our success during PPP are the primary
driving factors.
We are optimistic about loan growth in 2022 for a number of reasons. Core pipelines continue to be very strong;
line utilization, as detailed on slide 18, continues to trend up, from 36% to 40% during this past year when netting
out mortgage warehouse lines, and we anticipate this trend will continue. We have seen the average loan size in
our FIRST Insurance portfolio grow by over 10% this past year to $39,000 and over $40,000 in the fourth quarter.
We believe these levels will continue into 2022. And Wintrust Life Finance had a very strong year, growing their
portfolio by 20%. This momentum was maintained through the fourth quarter and should continue into 2022.
As a result, as Tim mentioned, we are reaffirming our loan growth guidance of mid- to high-single-digit growth
through 2022, but we think our short-term performance should continue to be at the higher end of that range and
we should continue to outperform our peer group.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 17, we continue to see solid credit performance across the
portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Non-performing loans decreased from $90 million or 27 basis
points to $74 million or 21 basis points. A meaningful part of this reduction came from the sale of a $10 million
portfolio of loans. The majority of these were non-performing. NPLs continue to be at record-low levels and
roughly half of where they were this time last year.
Charge-offs for the quarter were $6.2 million, approximately $2 million of which was a result of the loan sale that
we just discussed. And we – as Dave pointed out, we continue to see credit risk ratings show positive migration
as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic.
That concludes my comments on credit, and I'll turn it back to Ed to wrap up.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Thanks, Murph. Good job. It's amazing to be in the call. Our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during
the period of low rates, use our structural hedges, i.e., mortgages to buffer the loss of net interest income until
such time as balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to lower rates. PPP loans were an expected
benefit add-on to this strategy. [indiscernible] (00:26:57) will be accomplished while enhancing our interest rate
sensitivity position, anticipation of higher rates, which appeared to be on the near-term horizon.
We have more than covered the PPP loan write-off, which was our goal with core loans. It's fair to say that, to
date, the strategies have been accomplished in spades. The excellent growth we have put up over this period and
the Allstate portfolio purchase has been organic – other than the Allstate, portfolio purchase has been organic.
Acquisition market appears to be getting more active but so our expectations and fairly high. Continue to evaluate
opportunities in all areas of our business as they arise. As you know, we take what the market gives us, and right
now, it's given us great organic growth. We'll continue our historic approach to potential deals where it makes
sense. As you all know, I'm deathly allergic to earnings and book value dilution.
Really well positioned whatever the market brings us. Credit metrics are at their lowest levels in years and
pipelines remain consistently strong across the board. We expect this to continue due to our reputation in the
market, the market disruption that is and will continue to take place.
Diversified earning asset base continues to serve us well. Our line utilization should rise if inflation stays strong,
should be worth over $1 billion of digital loan growth if utilization returns to historical levels. Should we expect
wealth management revenue and assets to continue at their current glide path? Mortgages should continue to be
meaningful, but with lower contributions than in 2021.
As we mentioned in previous comments, our asset sensitivity position placed us in position taking advantage of
the rising rates. As Tim said, every 25 points should add $40 million to $50 million to our net interest income on
an annualized basis. Very much looking forward to seeing my beach ball, I guess. It's been underwater for a long
time.
We have the ability to put more of our liquidity use as rates rise. We've already been lagging into this strategy.
We're always and have always been a growth company, and this has not changed.
I direct your attention to charts on pages 4 through 8 in the release. The CAGRs indicated on those charts are all
of our vital statistics because that show our last 10 years of work. Numbers would be similar, if not better, if you
went back the entire 30 years of our existence. I put this body of work against any other bank in the country. I'm
very proud of our entire Wintrust team who works so hard to make this happen. I cannot wait to see what the next
30 years bring.
With that, I'll turn it over to – for questions.

Hard to believe. Maybe, Tim or Murph, can you talk a little bit about the kind of late growth in the quarter and what
you think drove that. It's a pretty good jumping-off point for Q1, but anything notable that you'd call out on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I don't think so. And I think if you look back at prior year-ends, you'd see a similar phenomenon. There is
always a rush to get deals closed before year-end. C&I was up. But, again, as I pointed out, it goes really across
categories. And there was just a big rush also in the Life Finance area, deals closing before the end of the year.
So, I don't think it's really atypical for a year-end. But it was very pronounced this year. We were – earlier in the
quarter, we were commenting that we – that the feedback we are getting was very solid performance for the
quarter, but we – it wasn't materializing. And then just really in December, it really started to ramp up quite a bit.
And I really just think it's a function of just that deadline of 12/31 and the holidays and everybody just pushing
things across the lines.

And then the other thing is, I think, everybody was dealing with a fair amount of capacity issues, from attorneys

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Tim, your comment on deposit costs not rising early in a rate hike cycle. What point do you start to think
about that? Or maybe said another way, how much runway do you think you have in terms of your deposit betas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon, I think it's going to be hard to tell because a lot of the market has a lot of liquidity right now. And so,
unlike prior cycles, where people might have been a little bit higher on the loan-to-deposit scale, we'll just kind of
have to see. We've seen very little deposit competition so far, and given the very low levels we start at, the betas
will obviously work themselves up over the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think, Jon – this is Dave, I think if you look at the prior cycle, we didn't see any rates in the first two, right, raises
by the Fed, and you really only started to see pressure on the third rate hike of 25 basis points. So, we'll just have
to see the size and the timing of and what competition does, but as Tim said, with all the liquidity in the market,
we wouldn't expect it to happen any faster than that. We think it could potentially – the betas could lag a little bit
more than that, given all the deposits in the system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, it seems that way. Just a quick one for you, Dave, on mortgage, on your mortgage guidance. You're saying,
start with the $28 million production revenue number, add servicing, and then take our best shot at the MSR
valuations. Is that the right way to look at it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, or the other way is just take the $53 million of total mortgage banking revenue and whack off the $6.7
million of MSRs and say that's your base, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Good. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Just a point on that, we think actual closed originations will probably be down just a little bit in the first quarter, but
we think the pipeline will build at the end of the quarter. So, if that happens, the lock-adjusted origination should
be fairly similar and the revenue should be fairly similar.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
How are you doing, David?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good, good. You guys talked a little bit about the strong loan growth in the quarter. But just curious if I can get a
little bit more color on – are these new relationships? Is utilization upticking? Where are these new loans coming
from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think utilization, as we talked about, is up a little bit. Businesses are doing better and utilization is very
real. We have probably a ways to go there. I think you had seen numbers closer to 50%, we're at 40%. So, I think
there's still lots of a headroom there. But I think, in general, thinking about the different loan products, most of this
is really coming as a result of market disruption in the C&I space because we – as we've talked about in prior
calls, I think we have really kind of become the bank in Chicago to go to.
And you look at what's going on with CIBC and some of the changes there, you look at what's happened with
MB/Fifth Third and a lot of the changes there, the First Midwest acquisition, there's just a lot of things that have
gone on where decisions aren't getting made locally anymore. And we've always positioned ourselves, as Ed in
the opening remarks talked about, this is – we are the – we have always been the local alternative to the big
banks, we continue to be that, and people do like that. They like being able to walk in and meet with the people
who are making the credit decisions, making – the people who are running the company. It is a key differentiator,
and most of that is resulting in these new relationships coming over.
But then if you look at, like, the Life portfolio, that's all new relationships. I mean, that is just people that really like
the product, see how it fits into their estate planning, and it has become a much more popular product in the
industry. And we are just capturing market share of that and getting more opportunities. So, it definitely is new
relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then on the deposit side, sort of the same direction here, but you had $2 billion in growth in the
quarter. Are these sticky deposits? Do you expect these to stay? I know you talked about the deposit beta, but will
these deposits stay on the balance sheet? Do you expect a runoff at any point once rates start moving higher?

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think you have a mix issue when rates are moving higher a bit, but a lot just sits in demand right now. But I
believe – well, we don't know basically. When people pull a lot of money out, they all had a lot of cash. If they pull
it out, will it come back to us? Probably. But that's why we're being a little bit slow on our – we take this into
consideration as we look into investing our excess liquidity. Tim, you want to comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ed, I think that's all right that there's probably a little bit of tax-related activity that'll occur in April. Obviously,
people have sold some businesses, they have parked money for their tax obligations. But we watch it very
carefully, David, and we'll react appropriately. It was a lot of growth.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good. Thanks. I went back. It took you a decade to grow your deposits $2 billion. You crossed that mark in 2001,
whereas you did that just in the last quarter. So, congrats on the fourth quarter. I guess a couple of questions, can
you maybe – how are you thinking about expense growth in 2022? A lot of talk of wage inflation, but then on the
flip side, maybe a softer mortgage market will impact some of your salaries and benefits.

Dave?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think that context is probably correct there, Ed. I think the way we look at it and, I will sound like a
broken record, compared to prior quarters is, we try to focus on that net overhead ratio, because the mortgage
15


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
business, if it goes up and down, the expenses go up and down. And so we look at the operating leverage from
that perspective, it was in the low-120s the last two quarters.
We expect to sort of hold that line a little bit. If mortgages go down, then it's possible that that turns up into the
130 basis points range. So I think our target for net overhead ratio is still serving the 130 basis point range. But
we expect to get leverage. But there clearly is some pressure on wages out there. But as you said, if mortgage
volumes are down, then those commissions will be down and related expenses.
We also have those expenses supporting spread business, right, loans and deposits. So as the spread business
goes up, there's a lot of built-in growth already actually for next quarter with over $1 billion worth of ending earning
assets over average. And so those spread income will start to come through and the growth in the balance sheet
will offset it. So we do think there'll be some pressure there, but we're also investing in robotic process automation
in some areas.
So not that that necessarily would cut a bunch of positions, but it would eliminate the need to add positions as we
grow. And so we're going to be able to leverage technology and the like. And so some of the digital
enhancements we're doing are going to reduce time to complete some functions in the organization, which should
also help let us leverage those technological advancements for growth.
So, yeah, there is pressure there, but we also think there's leverage in the system. And certainly, if we don't think
that our net overhead ratio targets are going up, we think we can grow into any of those sort of increases. And if
there's a rate increase, then that way more than offsets any pressure that you would have on those line items.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that, Dave. And then just as a follow-up, your commentary on bank M&A, a few years ago you were
looking and talking about larger deals. I guess is the message here, you're going to take what the market gives
you if something pops up or is there a bias towards a larger transaction? And as you think about markets, would
you be willing to expand into a newer market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I really don't think we've changed. We're very opportunistic as it comes to acquisitions. I can't – though couple of
quarters ago, I thought that big bank kind of accounts, there was just chum in the water. See if I can get a shark
up or a whale or a blowfish, I don't know. But I can't imagine us doing a bigger deal right now. It drives me crazy.
We talk to people of all from $1 billion and up, all worried about themselves and not about their shareholders,
drives me nuts. Said that before, I'll say it again. But we're going to be opportunistic on it in terms of – I can't
imagine us doing a really large deal, but I can't imagine us doing a deal that either in market or expanding the
market to contiguous states.
I think Northwest Indiana is still in our bucket list, we got to get there, to expand in Wisconsin and in the rest of
Illinois. But we only have 8% or 9% market share here in Chicago, plenty of room for us to grow here. As Tim
mentioned, we're opening up a couple of new branches, new areas we're not in. There's a number of areas we're
still not in that we're going to have to get to. So we'll take what the market gives us. I can't imagine we'll do a big
deal, but we're always looking and we'll be very opportunistic. But as I said, I'm allergic to dilution and let's –
Dave, he's got a big EpiPen. I don't think we'd do a big deal that would dilute the crap out of us.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I was curious, you said in your opening remarks that every rate hike equates to about 10 basis points of margin. I
was curious – since you guys are so asset-sensitive, is there any part of that 10 basis points that's got a delayed
effect? I mean, for example, if the market's pricing in a hike in March, would you believe to see that 10 basis
points in the second quarter or is it potentially like 7 immediately and 3 following on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I guess, what we'd point to is just when we said in our – so $40 million to $50 million over the next 12
months. And so I think it's going to depend on competition on another – other things, how fast that builds in, if it's
front-end loaded or not. I think, as Tim indicated and based upon on earlier question that there's probably a lag in
the deposit costs rise because of all the liquidity in the market which may be front-end loaded a little bit more but
you could get an increase on your earning assets a little quicker than your deposits are going to reprice. But
there's so many moving parts to the equation and what could happen with the slope of the yield curve et cetera.
But I think our general guidance is good right now, and we'll try to fine-tune it as rates go up. But I think we'll just
stick with what we gave you there.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. That's fair. And then when you think about hiring and the potential for talent, obviously, expenses
have increased industry-wide in terms of a salary line and the guidance is even more. Just curious how you guys
approach talent and the cost associated with that. Do you need to see revenue associated with the talent or is
there supporting back-offices that could potentially also increase the salary line items?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I can take part of that and Dave can add. I mean, we continue to believe we're an attractive endpoint for
bankers and revenue producers. And Rich talked about the disruption in the market that will drive that. Is there a
little bit of pressure from a wage standpoint? Yes. I don't think that's anything atypical from our standpoint at this
point. We're generally hiring commercial bankers. So we think the people are really important. They'll help us
continue to grow the company. The back office side of things we're doing a lot to limit the number of people we
would need and the ability to scale up. So there'll be some impact but I don't think it'll be outsized at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think we're always generally in the market for revenue producers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And so maybe that adds a little bit until they bring their book over with them. But if we can hire good people that
produce loans, I mean we're always investing in the business, right? So we would do that if there's good people
and we always have for the last 30 years, so no change in that approach.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the extra question. I guess going back to I think it was David Long's question on
deposit trends, you're kind of in line with other banks in terms of having vacuumed up 25 – or increased your
deposit base 25%, 30% since COVID started. Have you – have your bankers' started engaging with large pools of
deposits to try and get a sense of their stickiness or that or is that coming? How are you trying to be the player
coach in this and move into a higher rate environment?

Well, Tim is in charge of stickiness [indiscernible] (00:49:05).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sticky, right. It's a good question. And, Brock, we actually have. Our structure is kind of well-positioned to
do that because each of our banks can reach out to their largest clients and sort of determine what their intentions
are. And as we did that in the fourth quarter, we didn't see people reporting the large outflows or a large volatility.
And remember, some of the deposit growth is actually consumer-based and related to new account activity and
the stimulus payments and the like. But we're currently pleased that we're up to about 34%, 35% DDA. It's
obviously helpful to us going forward and a lot of it is related to the addition of new clients. So to Ed point – Ed's
point earlier, we will watch for some volatility, but we still think absent all of the noise we have and would have
had very, very strong deposit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And separately, I've been noticing this for a couple of quarters just in terms of wealth management, it
seems like many community even regional banks or larger banks struggle with wealth management, it's a product,
it's a line item, but it just doesn't move. Clearly, not the case here. And just if you were to kind of briefly
summarize your go-to-market strategy there and why you think it's distinctive versus what may be more traditional
bank wealth offerings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, it took a long time to get here. That wealth management business is a tough business. And maybe time we
thought we'd be there and need another piece. Finally, by last year, they said all the pieces are here, feel like [ph]
they want somebody to just (00:51:01) talk about the bears at that time. Scared the hell out of me but they've
been able to go and build and grow.
I would say their approach to market is the same as ours, it's high touch, high tech, seems to me resonating well
with the clients. Our name is out there a little bit more. Our size helps. Our reputation is out there and we're doing
a better job of cross-selling. So I don't know if we'll do anything different other than the fact that our products are
good, our service is good, our name is good. And that's how we're doing it, so one brick at a time.

Hey. Good morning. As you mentioned, Ed or you, Dave, mentioned the 3% NIM by the end of the year. If the
future is right, I'm interested in what assumptions you may be making on just a mix of your balance sheet given
the elevated cash in that assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Chris, it's Tim. The assumption is that we deploy a little bit of liquidity and that we continue to get the growth that
we've talked about, part of it is, obviously, pure interest rate help as the various indices move, but they're pretty
simplistic assumptions. And the thing I think we just have to be careful is that there are a bunch of deposit indices
and there's competitors in the mix and a number of other factors. So we just want to be a little bit cautious in
terms of forecasting what that might look like, but we're clearly positioned to benefit from rates up and expect that
we'll get a nice lift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But that doesn't assume liquidity levels go to pre-pandemic levels, that's just a slow, gradual remix, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's not assuming like – if you're wondering if it assumes all $6 billion of excess liquidity goes to work, it's
not doing that. It's a slow, steady investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. It sounds good. Thank you. Maybe another question maybe for Ed. You guys have had a good history of
having a pulse on big changes in the market. I remember the financial crisis you guys pulled back. Everything's
going really well right now. What's the wall of worry, if there is one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I don't know. We worry about everything. We're basic old-time bankers. That's why at the end of my initial
comments about – we have to look at how we responded to everything from the Great Recession to the
pandemic, to also 9/11. And during that period of time, we've been able to maneuver and move very, very quickly
to react to that. I think that's the same situation here.
We don't know what the market is going to give us, but we're going to take what it gives us, not get greedy. We're
diversified enough to know that if something isn't working we don't have to do that. We could do something else
we'll be working. So, I guess what I worry about most is, will the deposits stay, which I'm always worried about
that. Loan quality can't be this good for I keep saying that, but we are going to continue to call the portfolio and
might even do another sale or so just to keep the numbers even lower. So I don't know. What do you guys think?

David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think that the worry when that's – rate's low for long, I think the bigger concern was, was there a race to the
bottom on loan pricing because it's better than fed funds concept. I think with the perception now that rates are
going up I think people aren't kind of want to lock in those low loan rates. But if for some reason we back to a low
for long rate environment, you worry that people just continue to price down the loan products.
But our pipelines and our ability to get loans on our pricing metric – pricing matrix that we have as far as
profitability, we've been able to do it. So you're worried about it. But I think that worry is sort of goes away a little
bit with rising rates, because people don't lock in the lower spreads. So I just hope they increase the rates. But
competition is something we will deal with all the time. But as we saw in 2006, 2007, people race to the bottom on
spreads and I was concerned that might happen. But I think that concern is going away now.

Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Chris, I maybe would add to what Dave said. I think that the old adage about the worst loans are made in the best
of times, it's something that we – the credit team here is constantly thinking about which is when there's so much
liquidity in the marketplace, you see banks doing irrational things and we just have to be constantly mindful that
there's no loan out there that we absolutely have to do. We have good loan growth. If you just can't get there
because somebody else is doing something stupid, you just got to step away. And we think we've made good,
prudent credit decisions. But it is a very competitive market out there. And as Ed said, credit can't stay this good
forever. And time will tell.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Apologies there. I appreciate you guys taking the questions. Just going back to the excess liquidity
deployment discussion, just given the greater slope that we see in the yield curve of late, is it maybe more of the
willingness or sense of urgency to maybe put some liquidity to work in higher-yielding securities in the first half of
this year as opposed to maybe more of a laddered approach, particularly just given the potential for the long end
of the curve to flatten out as the Fed raises short-term rates and starts to unwind its balance sheet?

It's a great question. If we are going to lag, we've begun lagging into it a little bit. We have plenty of liquidity to do
all that, so we're going to take our time, make sure that there is somebody said earlier, make sure those deposits
are going to stay. The growth is there. I worry about that a little bit, but we have so many good sources of
deposits, not just our retail side, but see that our deferred exchange is going to produce a lot of deposits, both
management produces lot of deposits. So we have a really good, diversified deposit source but anybody else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I don't think there's a rush. I think we're patient and we've been rewarded a little bit as rates have moved quite
a bit in the last month or so. And as we've said, we're going to deploy some, but I don't think we're in a hurry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I'd love to use it via loan growth I mean and deploy it that way and see where deposits take us. But that's our first
choice.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We'd still like to – deposits to your inventory, we want to get more and more deposits. I mean, I have no
problem with putting out deposits [indiscernible] (00:59:04) liquidity, just another lever we can pull when the time
is right. So we are very active in terms of getting more deposits for our customers and putting that out just
because we have more inventory then.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I think, Nathan, I don't think anybody can predict what that yield curve is going to do. So if we invested
it all right now, I guarantee you the conventional Ginnie Mae would go up 50 basis points in the next quarter, so
we're going to a bit ladder it and see what the market gives. I mean, the market expectation for rate increases are
completely different now than they were three quarters ago or two quarters ago. So I don't think anybody knows
what it does. So we will take it over time and we'll be prudent. But as Tim says, loans are the first choice, and then
we'll ladder into this liquidity and see where it takes us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I personally believe in this inflation. As we've said all along, it's not transitory, never was. You're closer to a spiral.
Anybody wants to tell who you are. A quarter or half point, you're going to cut it personally. I don't know, even a
full point, is it going to stop anything? Way too much liquidity, the government's way too involved. So I actually
believe that you're going to see even higher rates that are coming down the pike.
But we will – they are forecasted, but that's my personal opinion. We got to just be very prudent how we lay the
money out. You don't want to be – going to lay it all out and then make a bet that way. But we're so well-

positioned right now to take advantage of whatever the market brings us in pretty good shape, so we're going to
leg into it and the timing will be somewhat staccato, but we'll see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A

That's a great lever to have to pull.

Edward Joseph Wehmer A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Definitely. I appreciate that color. On a separate topic, just thinking about mortgage-related expenses and
just kind of the outlook along those lines this year, perhaps for Dave, if mortgage volumes are maybe half the
level that we saw in the first quarter of 2021, is it as simple as kind of looking at the incentive comp line and
assume that is also reduced by half or have there been other kind of implementations within the mortgage cost
structure that could lead that expense bucket to be maybe a little more variable than what we've seen in the past
from you guys as the volumes come down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I don't think it's exactly linear. I mean, the spreads in the first quarter of last year were a lot higher, so it's our
spread compression that revenue goes away, but their commissions are based upon units, not based on revenue.
So I don't think it's linear because if you got into the higher production quarters, margins were much wider and so
it's not quite linear. But if you sort of normalize the production margins, then I think you get closer to your concept.
But I think you have to take into account that under Dodd-Frank, you can't pay commissions based on the
revenue you generate. You have to pay commissions based on the units. And so I think you have to normalize
your revenue margins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Which is why we always push to the overhead ratio. It's hard to know where they're going to be, but then that
overhead ratio at current levels are, one, we're expecting 130 around.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We're 121% this quarter. But our target is really sort of 130% to 135% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And if mortgages pick up, that number will go down.

But the other thing you can think of, Nate, is MSR is going to play into this, too. So if rates go up and our volume
is down, MSRs are going to – valuation is going to go up. And our servicing portfolio continues to grow and so
we'll have additional revenues off of that, too. So lots of moving parts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I know you guys don't like to count the MSRs, nor do we. But fact is it does add the earnings and capital and does
add – does help on the way up and hurts on the way down. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I guess I'm just kind of going back to a more normalized mortgage environment maybe in the first quarter of 2020,
incentive comp was $32 million or so. And if you guys do a similar level volumes in the first quarter of this year, is
that kind of a good level to go off or have there been any kind of nuances within your mortgage structure that
could cause those expenses to be more variable than what we've seen in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I don't think we've really changed our comp structure there. But you have to remember, the incentive line in
the press release includes bonuses and long-term incentive comp and commissions for wealth and mortgage and
everything else. It's not just the mortgage line. So...

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we've never stopped investing in the business. I mean, we're a growth company. You have to invest in the
business. We've always kept earnings growth, tangible book, credit growth in mind. So we are going to continue
to invest in the digital channels. We started that about three years ago. We have not done a very good job
explaining to you how much we spent, but it's been a lot of money we spent to get out there.
It's working because it's all the Greenwich awards we won, as you can see in the earnings release. Come June,
we're going roll out a major component of Deep Blue, which is full remake of the individual or the retail digital stuff.
We are in a great shape to do that. But stuff is expensive. So we do monitor. We think we'll be fine. We care. We
prioritize nicely. But robotics is something we're looking into a lot of different businesses, you can take some of
these rote procedures we go through and make them non-people which should keep the people close down and
they add to productivity.
We always look for other businesses that we can get into, added a couple this year smaller ones and continue to
do that. Diversification is still very important on both the deposit and the asset side. So we will look for other
deposit sources and loan products to get out there. And our people, we got to keep out people happy.
So you want to say anything, Dave?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.

EpiPen – many EpiPens, I like poking Ed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Perfect. And then my second question is just a follow-up on kind of the liquidity management asset. If we look
back to like 2018, as rates were rising and reaching higher levels, it was more of a mid-teens kind of percentage
of earning assets versus 23% today and was yielding somewhere around 2.7% versus 1.09% today. So has there
anything structurally changed either within the company or within the market that would prevent it from getting
back to sort of those levels if we were back into that sort of rate environment in a year or two years from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It really all depends on loan growth. We always ran 85% to 90% loan to deposits, time we got overnight we were
at 92% or 93%, it may [indiscernible] (01:08:13) other people happy. But if you get to 85% or 90% for some loan
to deposits, that would bring us back down to a little bit lower levels in terms of the overall liquidity portfolio. And
as there were about three years duration on all of our liquidity, including that money, including the overnight
25

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
money we have, we usually close to – higher than 6.5 years. So that's kind of going to be the basis of deployment
is love to get the loans back to 85% to 90%, which is our target range and then invest after that. That makes
sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. I think it does. Just real quick on the duration, you were saying 6.5 years now, is that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Look, historically, that's what we've been at, we're 3 – we're a little over – we're 3.1 now, so plenty of room
to grow.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Gunther of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I just have one follow-up on the overhead ratio discussion. So the commentary of 120
basis points moving towards 130 to 135 basis points that longer-term target as mortgage normalizes, as we
overlay the asset sensitivity discussion and that glide path to a 3% margin, I mean in that scenario, do you think
you can sustain around current levels or even improve upon or are the franchise investment and growth mode still
likely to take us to that 130-ish basis points range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, the 130 basis points doesn't really get impacted by margin because the net overhead ratio is non-
interest income minus non-interest expense and take that result divided by average assets. And so, that's how we
sort of break down as we look at managing the company, you manage your margin, you manage your provision
costs, and then you manage your net overhead ratio which is non-margin-related. So the increase in rates other
than potentially reducing mortgage production doesn't really have an impact on the net overhead ratio.
So we've been 120 basis points and we're 120 basis points this quarter with a relatively, seasonally softer
mortgage volumes. But that included an MSR adjustment. If you take that MSR adjustment out, you're up closer
to 130 basis points. So, the 130 basis points sort of is today's sort of environment without an MSR benefit. And we
think as we continue to grow, we should be able to uphold that or improve upon it as we get operating leverage.
But a rise in rates doesn't necessarily directly impact the net overhead ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
If you think back, 1.5% was our net overhead goal. We've been able to get more leverage into the system as
we've been able to grow, and so down to 130 basis points to 135 basis points is not bad. That's the kind of
leverage we picked up by being able to handle more assets with under that expense base. So I think as we
26


Wintrust Financial Corp.
(WTFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
continue to grow, I think next year, we came at – hypothetically, I don't know what will happen but like $60 billion
not going to happen, but I would expect [indiscernible] (01:11:57) even more as you get more and more leverage
out of it. But we shall see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I think the short answer is the only thing the rates impact on the net overhead ratio, generally speaking,
is if mortgage rates go up, then the mortgage servicing rights going to gain in value and you're probably going to
put pressure on your originations. And so you just have to take that into account.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
No. I appreciate it, guys. That's a pretty good explanation and thank you for that. And if I then maybe ask a
different way on the – in that 3% margin range, do you expect to be able to demonstrate overall positive operating
leverage in 2022 from a [ph] net interest income (01:12:45) perspective.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just on mortgage, I was looking through the press release here and half the
volume was refi, I'm assuming that it should be falling pretty fast here given the moving rates, are you trimming
expenses in that segment, preparing for heavier sailing or haven't you moved in that direction yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Oh, yeah. We've been able to reduce staff in the mortgage area. Well, they don't show because we utilize them in
a different area. Our premium finance life business are growing so fast we needed to get some help, but we got
really good people. We like to keep involved, but we are monitoring mortgage cost. We want to keep that fixed
variable concept going. In other words, lower the fixed expense, get more variable expenses and we're
accomplishing that, I believe, and we'll go from there. But, yes, we've got all the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I think, Brock, in the first quarter, we're probably thinking 60% purchase – 60%, 65% purchase and refi
has taken down. But that even though some of the potential borrowers are in a position to do a refi just because
of lower rates, we are seeing some cash out refis is a big part of the refi volume now, so people kind of use them
the 30-year product as their home equity product of old and so that's keeping that refi volume up a little bit
because there's a fair amount of cash out refi is going on and people are willing to maybe even do it at a little bit
higher rate because it's 30-year am on the loan versus a home equity line which would be a lower am and they
keep their payments down. So we're seeing a lot of cash out refis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Finally, [indiscernible] (01:15:10) you're going to see obviously home values continue to go up and people
will go back to that pattern of reinstate – it always – and in the old days, if you look at the pattern, it got a
mortgage, got a home equity line. We run up the old equity line, pay up the home equity line with a new mortgage
and go from there. But imagine we're kind of getting into that period of time. That's kind of the inflationary way to
do it I guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I noticed the MSR market is about 112 basis points where you're carrying that MSR asset. Just for
context, back in 2018 or so before rates started coming down, where was that roughly? Just trying to gauge what
kind of ceiling we could have on that on that mark. .
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, Brock, I don't have that in front of me. Although there was a time where those numbers were in the 130
basis points range. So I don't know if that was 2018 or not, but they certainly could go up higher than this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
