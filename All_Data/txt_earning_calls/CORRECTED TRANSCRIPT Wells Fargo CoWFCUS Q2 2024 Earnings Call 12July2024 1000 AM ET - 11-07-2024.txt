Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, John. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and update you on our
priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. So
let me start with some second quarter highlights. Our financial performance in the quarter benefited from our
ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continued to generate strong fee-based revenue growth, with
increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our
businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities, and
Investment Banking. These results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Credit
performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations. Consumers have benefited from the
strong labor market and wage increases.
The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit tightening actions,
and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as
expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations. In our commercial
portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties, where we expect losses to
remain lumpy. Fundamentals in the institutional owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower
appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they
still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses. We continued to
execute on our efficiency initiatives which has driven head count to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average
commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter.
The higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan
demand, and we've not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balanced growth in our credit card
portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly
from the first quarter, with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses. Now, let me update
you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk controller. We are a different Wells Fargo from when I arrived.
Our operational and compliance risk and control buildout is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables
are completed and we embed this mindset into our culture, similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit
risk today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans.
The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment. While we
see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is
done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have
now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity,
and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set
ourselves. While we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment,
the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment and we remain at risk of further regulatory
actions.
We are also a different Wells Fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our
customers and help drive higher returns over time. Let me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making.
We're diversifying revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income. We are improving our credit
card platform with more competitive offerings which is important both for our customers and strategically for the
company. During the second quarter, we launched two new credit cards, a small business card and a consumer
card. Since 2021, we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product buildout.
The momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
We are not lowering our credit standards, but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being
well received by the market.
Building a larger credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to
marketing, promo rates, on-boarding, and allowance which drive little profitability in early years but as long as our
assumptions on spend, balance growth, and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business
to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures. We've have been methodically
growing our corporate investment bank which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for
us. We are executing on a multiyear investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline, and our positive
momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in
targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth.
Fernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate Investment Banking. Fernando has deep
knowledge of our industry and his background and skills complement the terrific team Jon Weiss has put together.
While we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short- and medium-term
and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in Investment Banking
fees during the first half of the year. In our Wealth and Investment Management business, we have substantially
improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisors and our Consumer
Banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth. In the Commercial Bank, we are focused on growing
our Treasury Management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated and
delivering our Investment Banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant
opportunities in the years ahead.
And we continue to see significant opportunities for our Consumer, Small and Business Banking franchise to be a
more important source of growth. Let me give you just a few examples of some of the things we're doing here. We
continue to optimize and invest in our branch network. While our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we
are being more strategic about branch location strategy. We are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches,
completing 296 during the first half of this year, and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five
years. As part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we are also increasing our investment in our
branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience which has been
a positive for both our bankers and our customers.
We continue to have strong growth in mobile users, with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year
after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistance, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117
million interactions. We expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our
customers additional self-service features and value-added insights, including balance trends and subscription
spending. Looking ahead, overall, the US economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid
growth. However, the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still elevated inflation and
elevated interest rates. As managers of a large, complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the
opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers
and clients.
The actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic
environments, and while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us. Our commitment and the
progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is
foundational for our company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete
our work. We have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream, and are
seeing the early progress in our results. And we've maintained strong financial risk disciplines and a strong

balance sheet. Operating with a strong capital position in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime
imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirement resulting from Basel
III finalization has served us well.
It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, and we remain committed to prudently return excess
capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock
dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly
scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of
this year. And while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the
progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo. I'm excited about the
opportunities ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.33 per
diluted common share. EPS grew from both the first quarter and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in
our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments we've been making.
We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company. I will also note that our second quarter
effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for
renewable energy tax credit investments which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 percentage
points versus a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had
an offsetting increase to non-interest income.
Turning to slide 4, as expected, non-interest income was down – net interest income was down $1.2 billion or 9%
from a year ago. This decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances
and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs
in our commercial businesses as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning
assets. Net interest income declined $304 million or 2% from the first quarter. Given the higher rate environment
and weak commercial loan demand, loan balances continued to decline as expected. We saw positive trends
including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customer-facing
businesses, including within our consumer business.
Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter. This slowed the pace of growth
in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points from the second quarter after increasing 16
basis points in the first quarter. If the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing
would begin to decline, with the most immediate impact in new promotional rates in our consumer business and
standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing moved faster as rates increased and we would expect [ph]
business (00:13:44) to also be higher as rates decline. On slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans
were down from both the first quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other
categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.
Average deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate
funding offset declines in our consumer businesses driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives
and continued consumer spending. Average deposits grew $4.9 billion from the first quarter. Commercial deposits
have grown for three consecutive quarters as we successfully [ph] attracted (00:14:27) clients' operational
deposits. After declining for nearly two years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
We've seen outflows slow as many rate-seeking customers in Wealth and Investment Management have already
moved into cash alternative products, and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to
retain and acquire new balances in Consumer, Small and Business Banking. These improved deposit trends
allowed us to reduce higher-cost market funding.
The migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our
percentage of non-interest bearing deposits declining to 26% in the first quarter to 25%. Turning to non-interest
income on slide 6, non-interest income increased 19% from a year ago with growth across most categories
reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market
conditions as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in net interest income with
revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. I will
highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment results. Turning to expenses
on slide 7, second quarter non-interest expense increased 2% from a year ago driven by higher operating losses,
an increase in revenue-related compensation, and higher technology and equipment expense.
These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and
professional and outside services expense. Operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher
customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us.
The 7% decline in non-interest expense from the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel
expense in the first quarter. Turning to credit quality on slide 8, net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from
the first quarter to 57 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by higher commercial net loan
charge-offs which were up $127 million from the first quarter to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily
reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio.
While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last
quarter, they were in line with our expectations. As we have previously stated, commercial real estate office
losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work
to de-risk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process. These efforts helped to reduce our office
commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased $25
million from the first quarter to 88 basis points of average loans. Auto losses continue to decline, benefiting from
the credit tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line
with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus and as more recent
vintages mature.
Importantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we
currently expect the credit card charge-off rates to decline in the third quarter. Non-performing assets increased
5% from the first quarter driven by the higher commercial real estate office non-accruals. Moving to slide 9, our
allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter driven by declines across most asset classes
partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for
total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent. Our
allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately
11% for the past several quarters.
Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 10, our capital position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 11%
continued to be well above our current 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We're also above our expected
new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the fourth quarter of this year and our stress capital
buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the second
quarter, and while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock, as Charlie

highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%, subject to board
approval. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11,
Consumer Small and Business Banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances
and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products.
Home lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances
continued to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher
point of sale volumes and new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue. Auto revenue declined 25%
from last year driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue
was down 4% from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key
business drivers on slide 12, retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago reflecting our focus on
simplifying the lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new
strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced head count in home lending by approximately 45%.
Balances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with a year ago driven by lower origination volumes which
were down 23% from a year ago reflecting previous credit tightening actions. Both debit and credit card spend
increased from a year ago. Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 13, Middle Market Banking revenue
was down 2% from a year ago driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs partially offset by
growth in Treasury Management fees. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue decreased 17% year-over-year
including lower net interest income, lower lease income, and revenue from equity investments. Average loan
balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid reflecting the higher for
longer rate environment and markets where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 14. Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago driven
by higher Investment Banking revenue due to increased activity across all products partially offset by lower
Treasury Management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts. Commercial real
estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew
16% from a year ago driven by strong performance in equities, structured products, and credit products. Average
loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real
estate where originations remain muted and we've strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio, as well as
declines in banking where clients continue to access capital markets funding.
On slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago. Higher
asset-based fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income
reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding
alternatives. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so
third quarter results will reflect market valuations as of July 1 which were up from both a year ago and from April
1. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our
venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and non-interest expense on slide
17, at the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than
full year 2023.
During the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected, with net interest
income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook
reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had
assumed in our original expectations which has helped us reduce market funding. Deposit cost increased during
the first half of this year as expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed. However, late in the second
quarter, we increased pricing in Wealth and Investment Management on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage

accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, better aligns rates with rates paid in money
market funds, and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year.
Our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances. At the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in
average loans for the full year which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second
half of the year after a slow start to the year. As we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call, loan balances
were weaker than expected and that strength continued into the second quarter. We expect this
underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second
quarter levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full year 2024 net interest income to be in the
upper half of the range we provided in January or down approximately 8% to 9% from full year 2023. We continue
to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of the year.
We are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain and we
will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to
expenses, at the beginning of this year, we expected our full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately
$52.6 billion. We currently expect our full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $54 billion. There
are three primary drivers for this increase. First, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations driving
higher revenue related compensation expense in Wealth and Investment Management. As a reminder, this is a
good thing as these higher expenses are more than offset by higher non-interest income. Second, operating
losses in the other customer remediation related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than
we expected.
As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact
operating losses during the remainder of the year. Finally, we did not anticipate the $336 million of expense in the
first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll
continue to update you as the year progresses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflected the
progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance. Our strong growth in
fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our
efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remains strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and
we continue to make progress on our path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15%.
We will now the take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please stand
by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Mike, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points
you made on the changes on the deposit cost side. First of all, I guess relative to the 12 basis points that you saw
in terms of interest bearing cost increase which was lower than the 17 basis points, how do you just generally
expect that to look going forward? And is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going
forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, thanks, Ken. Yes, the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward. You saw about basically about a
month's worth in the quarter. We made the change in June. So you saw about a third of a quarterly impact already
included in the number. Look, I think when you drill into what's going on in the deposit side, I'd say a few things.
One, overall – we're not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits. On the consumer side, this
migration that's been happening now for a while from checking into savings or CDs is still happening but at a
slower pace, and you can see that over the last couple years as it's been pretty stable the last quarter or two. But
it's definitely slowing as you look at the quarter. And so I'd anticipate you'd still see more migration but continuing
to slow as we look forward.
On the wholesale side, the pricing's been pretty competitive now for a while and that's the case. And so we've
been pleased to see that we're able to grow good operational deposits. And so given the competitive pricing
there, that puts a little near-term pressure on NII. But those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long
period of time particularly as rates start to come back down. And so the positive I think overall, as you saw
deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time and that migration is slowing to higher
yielding alternatives. And so we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year, but I think there's some good
positive trends that are emerging there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up. The fees were really good and the trading business continues to
demonstrate that it's taking market share. I guess, how do we understand how to kind of measure that going
forward, right, versus what the group's doing. You guys are definitely zigging and outperforming there. Where do
you think you are in terms of market share gains, and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run rate of
trading is going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I'll take that, and Charlie can chime in if he wants. As you look at trading in any given quarter it's going to
bounce around, right? So you can't necessarily straight line any single quarter. So I'd be careful there as you look
forward. But I think the good part is, like, we've been methodically sort of making investments in really all the

asset classes, FX, credit, a lesser degree in equities and other places, but we're getting the benefit of those
investments each quarter on an incremental basis. I think that business is still constrained by the asset cap, and
so we are not growing assets or financing clients' assets at the same level we would be if we didn't have the asset
cap, which also then drives more trading flow as we go. And so I'd say we're still methodically sort of building it
out and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while.
But any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on what's happening in the market or an asset
class, and we're getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow
to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And this is Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things, which is as we think about the things that we're doing to
invest in our banking franchise, both markets and the Investment Banking side of the franchise, it's not risk-based.
It's actually, it's focused on customer flows on the trading side. It's focused on expanding coverage and improving
product capabilities on the banking side. So what we look at – and we're also very, very focused on returns overall
as you can imagine as all the other large financial institutions are. So, as we're looking at our progress, we do
look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up. And so as
you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace, we are looking at a sustained level of growth,
recognizing that we don't control the quarter-to-quarter volatility.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. You expressed confidence that NII should bottom towards the year end or towards the back half of
this year. Maybe could you just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view just given the loan
growth dynamics that you mentioned and just mentioned the funding cost and the rate backdrop? If you could just
kind of walk us through your confidence in that inflection and I guess what it could mean as you go into 2025.
Thanks.

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. We won't talk much about 2025, John. But as you sort of look at what's happening, you're seeing this pace
of migration on the deposit side flow as I mentioned earlier, so you're seeing more stability as time goes by there.
Once the Fed starts lowering rates, which the market expects to happen later in the year, you'll start to see betas
on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base. You'll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing
on the asset side as you see more securities and more loans sort of roll. And so you've got to – exactly calling
sort of the trough is – which quarter it's going to be sometimes can be a little tough. But as you sort of look at all
the components of it, we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, Mike. And if I could just hop over to capital. Buybacks, I mean, you bought back about $6.1 billion
this quarter, similar to the first quarter. You indicated the pace will slow. Maybe could you give us a little bit of
color on how we should think about that moderation and how long that could persist at this point and how long
until you could be back at the run rate you were previously?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, let me take a shot at it, Mike, and then you can add the color on this one. Listen, I think when you look at
where we've been running capital, we've been trying to anticipate as I mentioned in my prepared remarks the
uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about SCB as well as the uncertainty that exists with where
Basel III ultimately comes out. The reality of those two things are we know where the SCB is for this year at this
point; we still don't know where Basel III ultimately winds up. So I think as we sit here today, we will continue –
we'll be conservative on capital return in the shorter-term until we learn more about exactly where Basel III will
ultimately wind up, and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital returns. So I just – I think
we're just trying to be very pragmatic.
The reality is we're still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonably-sized dividend that's increased
as our earnings power has increased. Given the fact that we have constraints, most of what – the remainder of
our capital generation goes towards capital return. But we want to see where Basel III ultimately winds up.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Just maybe one follow-up first, Mike and Charlie, on capital. Is 11% a line in the sand right
now as you wait for Basel and clarity there, as we – at least you're not guiding for it. But as we think about what
the pace of buybacks might be or could CET1 go below 11%, still significant buffer with the 9.6% minimum, would
appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think where we are, plus a little bit; probably not minus a little bit but plus some is probably the right place to be
at this point. Remember, the SCB was higher than we expected, and so that's factoring into our thinking. And so
that's really what's driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point. But again, hopefully
we'll get some more clarity on Basel III. We know what you know and then we'll be much clearer about what we
think the future looks like there. But again, overall, we still have the capacity to buy back. We just, as we've
always been, we want to be prudent.

Understood. And then just moving to expenses, so I get the guide, the expense guide increased. But remind us
has anything changed, maybe Charlie, from you first, on the expense flex that's a big part of the wealth thesis
around efficiency gains which should lead to the path for that 15% ROTCE? And what are you baking in in terms
of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide? Like, does it assume elevated levels of trading in IB?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Let me just take the first part. I appreciate you asking the question. I think from as we look forward, nothing has
changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient. That story is no different
today than it was yesterday or last quarter. As we increased the estimates for the year, it's really reflective of three
broad categories. One are the variable expenses that relate to our Wealth and Investment Management business
where we have higher revenues that results in a higher payout. And as Mike always points out, that's actually a
good thing even though it's embedded in the expense line which causes that number to head upwards. The
second thing are the fact that we've had higher customer remediations and FDIC expenses in the first half of the
year than when we contemplated the expense guidance.
On the customer remediations, we've said they're not new items. They're historical items. We're getting closer to
the end of finalization in these things, and as that occurs, things like response rates and making sure that we've
identified the full amount of the population gets all fine-tuned and that's what's flowing through, but that's a, it
really relates to historical matters and not something that's embedded in what we see in the business going
forward. So what you're left with is the rest of the earnings – I'm sorry, the expense base of the company, and it's
playing out as we would have expected. And so as we sit here and look forward, all the statements I've made in
the past are still true which is we're not as efficient as we need to be. We're focused on investing in growing the
business.
We're focused on spending what's necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure, and we're focused
on driving efficiency out of the company and that lever is as – continues to be exactly what it's been.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. And you assume fees staying elevated in the back half as part of the guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

Yeah, we assume equity markets are about where they are today. So still staying pretty elevated.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
Hi. Good morning. First, I just want to be put context to this question, because I didn't want to ask it just in
isolation because it seems ticky-tacky, but it's not. So the stock is down 7.5%, and if I just take consensus to the
higher end of your NII range to 9% that would imply that consensus would address 3.5% in isolation. So this is
just a context of why I'm asking this question on expenses. So your expenses went up in terms of – from your
original guide, $1.4 billion. I guess you laid out those three bullets and you quantified FDIC special assessment. I
guess I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more the remediation expenses
and op losses were up versus your original expectation, because I think what the market wants to understand is
NII, okay, we get it, that's happening because of deposit rate pricing, but is core PPNR outside of that going up,
right?
Just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the EPS going to be down as much coming out of this as
the market is indicating?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, no, Erika, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. We give you the operating loss line in the supplement so you
can see that, and if you – based on what we had said in January, if you assume that the $1.3 billion on a full year
basis was just split evenly across all the quarters, you can see that the operating losses are up about $500 million
year-to-date over that run rate. So that's the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is year-to-
date in the first half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
So then you take that, you add the FDIC to it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Right. And the remainder is roughly the revenue-related expenses in Wealth Management.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
So that's why, Erika, when I was talking before when you look at what's driving the increase in the expense guide,
it's remediations in the first and second quarter, it's the FDIC expense that you've seen, and it's the increase in
variable expenses. Everything else is playing out as we would have expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And just maybe some comments on how you're thinking about credit quality from
here. It looks like you continued to release reserves in the second quarter. Is this a message that you feel like
you've captured most of the CRE-related issues? Of course, absent of a further deterioration in the economy. And
how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your charge-offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, when you say – well, I think when we look at the reserves, you have to bucket into different pieces our
exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business and our – based on underwriting changes we've

made, it's not just balances but also the actual losses, so that's what's driving the reductions in that part of the
loss reserves on the consumer side. And on the credit card side, it's really driven – the increase is really driven by
balances. So you've got two very different dynamics going on there with the releases being just representative of
a smaller, higher credit quality credit portfolio. And then on the wholesale side, the losses that we've seen and the
credit performance in our CIB office CRE portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we
set our ACL, but there's still uncertainty there, so we're maintaining the coverage.
So overall, there's really – in terms of our expectations, no real change from what we're seeing in the CRE
portfolio which is where the loss content is actually coming through. And elsewhere, things are still fairly benign
other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business, but no real trend there.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit cost for Wells? Was it to keep up
with competition? Was it trying to get ahead of some potential repricing pressures, or what was kind of the logic
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, hey, it's Mike, Matt. So this was very specific to a sweep product in the Wealth business, so it's a portion of
that overall deposits and it doesn't have any bearing on any other product. I would just leave it at that. Very
specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And how big is that, those deposit balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
We don't – that's not something we normally have out there. But you can see the impact is, I sort of highlighted
the impact is roughly $350 million for the rest of the year for the second half of the year. So I would just use that
as – and that's already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just separate topic here. The credit card growth has been very good. You highlighted rolling out
some new products, and the question is always [indiscernible] (00:46:50) in certain categories [indiscernible]
(00:46:52) growing too quickly. The loss rates have gone up, maybe a little more than some peers, not as much
as some others. Obviously in line with what you were targeting. There was that negative Wall Street Journal

article on one of your cards. So just kind of taken together, what kind of checks and balances do you have to
make sure that a somewhat new initiative for you that you're growing at the right pace? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, so, Mike, I'll start, and then you can chime in. So first of all, when we look at our credit card performance,
we do not look at it in total. We look at each individual product. We look at all of the performance broken out by
vintage and we compare the results that we're seeing both in terms of balance build as well as credit
performance, not losses, but starting very early with early on books delinquencies, and we look at how they're
playing out versus pre-pandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the
product. As I've said, we look at the actual quality of the consumers that we're underwriting and the overall credit
quality. We haven't compromised credit quality at all. We've probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on
relative to where we had been, but the actual performance when you look at the vintages is – it's really spot-on
with what we would have expected.
So what you're seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio. And the last thing
I'll just say is just when you think about The Wall Street Journal articles, we've launched a lot, a bunch of new
credit cards. That is a relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards take that we issue and what our
strategy is, that's a very, very, very small piece of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, and I'll just add one piece. As you look at new account growth, we're not originating anything less than 650,
so as Charlie mentioned some of the credit tightening – 650 FICO. So as Charlie mentioned, the credit box has
not been broadened really at all. And when you look at some of the bigger products like cash back, like the cash
back card, active cash, the new originations are coming in at higher credit quality than the back book was, and so
at this point, as Charlie said, we go through it at a very, very granular level each quarter and results are kind of
right where we expect, and if we start to see any kind of weakness at all, we're adjusting where needed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And just one last comment here which is again, because I appreciate the question. Whenever you see a lot of
growth in a product that has risk in it, it's always the right thing to ask the questions. We're not – this isn't – the
people that are doing this both in our card business, who runs consumer lending, myself, this is not a new product
for us. We've seen this happen in the past. We've seen people do this well and we've soon people not do this
well, and so we're very, very conscious of the risks that you're pointing out as we go forward just as we are on the
other businesses that we're investing in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And obviously you talked about card losses going down in 3Q, so that's consistent with
everything you said as well. So thank you for the color.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So just wanted to make sure on the expense guide, I get the point that a bunch of that is related to better
revenues from Wealth Management and so we should be anticipating as a part of that that revenues for Wealth
Management in the second half is going to be at least at one half or maybe even a little higher. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I mean, Betsy, I covered that in my script too. So as you look at the advisory assets there, they get price
based, most of them get priced in advance for the quarter so you know what third quarter looks like based on
where we are now. And obviously it's not all equity market. There's fixed income in there as well, but you should
see a little bit of an increase as you go into the third quarter based on where the markets are now and then we'll
see what the fourth quarter looks like when we get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Okay. So just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev beat that – I know you're not
guiding revs up, but interpretation leads you down that path. And so then I guess the other piece of the question I
just had to relate with the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier and what's your view of interest in
leaning into the markets business today? I realize there's opportunity. There's still the asset cap constraint. But
you're not at the asset cap, so there is room for you to lean in, there are players who are a little bit more
constrained on capital than you even in that space, so is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into
especially when C&I and CRE and other types of loans are low demand right now as you indicated earlier.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, let me start. I think, so first of all, relative to where the balance sheet is running, we're not – we want to –
we're careful about how we run the overall balance sheet, right? Which is we don't want to operate at the cap on a
regular basis because you've got to be prepared both for customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when
you see it as well as we lived through COVID where there was an event and all of a sudden there were a bunch of

draws and we have to live within that asset cap. So running it with a cushion is a very smart thing we think for us
to do even though you can argue we're giving up some shorter-term profit, so that's just the reality of where we
live. And so as we think about the markets business and what that means, in a perfect world we'd be allowing
them to finance some more. There are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that.
But what we are doing is as we think about inside the company, optimizing the balance sheet and where we get
the most returns and where there's more demand than less demand, there has been less demand in other parts
of the company and there's been more demand on the trading side, so our assets are actually up 15-ish percent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Trading – if you go to the supplement, Betsy, trading assets on an average basis are up 17%, a little more
on a spot basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
So we're just trying – so we're reflective of what those opportunities are but we've got to keep capacity for the
reasons I mentioned.

Charlie, you mentioned in your opening comments about Fargo – you guys launched Fargo over a year ago, I
guess, and you're having real good pick-up. Can you share with us any other AI-orientated programs that are in
work-in-progress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies or cost savings or even revenue
enhancements as you go forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. When we think about AI, we do break it into different categories, right? There's traditional AI and then
there's Gen AI. We have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the company with just traditional
AI, and that is – it's in marketing, it's in credit decisioning, it's in information that we provide bankers on both the
wholesale and the consumer side about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a
17

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
discussion about, and so that is – in a lot of respects, that's business as usual for us. The new opportunity that
exists with Gen AI is where AI creates something based upon whether it's public data or our own data in terms of
things that haven't existed. We are most focused in the shorter-term on things that can drive efficiency, but it also
contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers.
So, great examples of things like that are call centers. We take lots of phone calls and we've got lots of
opportunities through AI to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep. But once they get to
a call center rep, we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly but also making sure that we're
capturing that information, understanding root cause across all these calls we get. That means bankers have to
go – telephone bankers have to go in, actually enter what the call was about, what they think the root cause is, we
then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth. Through Gen AI, that can be done automatically. It could be
done immediately and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause, so then we can go back, look at it,
make sure that's the case and make the change. So ultimately, that results in fixing defects going forward but it
also takes so much manual effort out of what we do.
So any place where something is written, something is analyzed by an individual, we've got the opportunity to
automate that. Those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side. To the extent that they
impact a consumer, we're going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that. And so the
work is a meaningful part of as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. I appreciate those insights. And then just as a quick follow-up, you also mentioned about improved
advisor retention in the quarter. And when you look at your Wealth and Investment Management segment, I
recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver. Investment advisory and other asset-
based fees are in revenues for this division, but I noticed that they've been flat to down this year and they were up
over a year ago. Is it seasonal in the second quarter that that line of business just gets soft or is it the higher rate
environment where customers are just leaving more cash in – more assets in cash because they're getting 5% or
so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, there really is no rhyme or reason necessarily, Gerard, to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next,
necessarily. Obviously, if there's like large bouts of volatility you might see more transaction activity. That certainly
hasn't been the case necessarily in the equity market in the second quarter. But to some degree, as that line item
– over a very long period of time that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up, and that's actually a
really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well.

Thanks. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Just given the sheer amount of, I guess, investor questions
that we received on the deposit pricing changes in Wealth, I was hoping you could provide some additional
context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating or at least being in the very
late innings, and want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing. Was it impacting
advisor recruitment or retention? Was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet? And – or is this an
effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing in sweep deposits and force others to
potentially follow suit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

Yeah, Steve, it's Mike. I'd say just a couple things. One, this is not in reaction to cash sorting. We are seeing cash
sorting slow in the Wealth business just like we're seeing that in the Consumer business, so this is not a reaction
to that in any way. It's a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the Wealth business and it is
very specific to this product which is in an advisory account where there's frictional cash there. So it's not a
reaction to competitive forces that we're seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth.

Understood. And just one follow-up on the discussion relating to expenses and just given the fee momentum that
you're seeing within CIB and Wealth and you're clearly making investments in both of those segments, at the
same time, the incremental margins have actually been quite high especially in CIB where it's running north of
75% just first half this year versus last. I was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee
momentum being sustained, what do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within CIB and
Wealth, recognizing the payout profiles are different?

Well, let me start on the Wealth side and I'll come back to the IB Banking – or Banking side. So on the Wealth
side, what's really going to help us drive margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things.
One is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side, which you can see happening. And then two,
and we've talked about this in other forums, it's doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking
and lending products. And when you look at our loans in the Wealth business and you look at the overall asset
base or the advisor for us, we're much less penetrated than some of the peers. And so I think those things really
help drive us to get to more best-in-class margins which are higher than where we sit today. And that takes some
time on the lending side in this rate environment. It's a little harder to drive that growth, and as rates start to come
down, you'll probably see more demand there.
And so there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come to from a timing perspective. But those are things
that Barry Sommers and the whole management team in Wealth are very focused on and making sure we've got
the right capabilities, the right sales force, the right support for the salesforce, and so forth. On the I-Banking side,
we've been making investments in that business now for the better part of two-plus years, a little longer than that
probably, and as we're adding good people we're also making sure that we've got the right people in the right
seats. And so you're not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior head count. You're actually, we're
making sure we have the right people in the right seats, and so you've seen some reductions as you've seen
some growth. And so that's helping also moderate the overall investment. And then also as we've brought those
people on, you're paying them full freight when you recruit people, right?

So what you're seeing is you're getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now, but
you've already got the expense in the run rate to some degree, and so I think you'll see that pace of margin
expansion moderate over time. But what you're seeing is what you should expect which is like we made the
investments, you're paying the people, now they're becoming productive incrementally each quarter, and that's
good to see.
