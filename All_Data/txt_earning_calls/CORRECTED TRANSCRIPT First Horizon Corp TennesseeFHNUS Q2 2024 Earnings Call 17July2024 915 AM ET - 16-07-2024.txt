Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'm pleased with the results we
achieved in another solid quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to produce consistent returns for our
shareholders while also providing unparalleled service to our clients.
As I look back at the last couple of months, there has been a significant uptick in the competitive landscape,
especially promotional deposit officers, as banks compete for growth against the backdrop of a higher for longer
interest rate environment and a shrinking deposit base. I'll start on slide 5, where we have shared some of the
financial highlights for the quarter. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.36 per share, which was a $0.01 increase
from the prior quarter, with pre-provision net revenue increasing by $1 million.
Adjusted return on tangible common equity improved to 12%, driven by the benefit of returning excess capital to
shareholders. We repurchased $212 million of stock in the second quarter and over $365 million year-to-date,
ending the quarter with an 11% tangible common equity Tier 1 ratio – excuse me, 11% common equity Tier 1
ratio. We intend to continue to stack one good quarter on top of the next. We accomplished that this quarter
through modest improvement to net interest income and traditional banking fees while simultaneously managing
the expense base and maintaining strong credit performance. I remain incredibly optimistic that First Horizon will
continue to deliver strong results quarter after quarter while serving our customers and communities, just as we
have for over the past 160 years.

We have an attractive footprint, a competitive product set, and a strong credit culture culture that will allow us to
profitably navigate whatever scenarios we encounter over the second half of the year.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Hope to run through our financial results in more detail. Hope?

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. On slide 6, you will find our adjusted financials and key
performance metrics for the quarter. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.36, up $0.01 from the prior
quarter. Pre-provision net revenue was stable to the prior quarter as net interest income and traditional banking
fees offset the moderation in the fixed income business.
Credit performance continues to be within our expectations, with net charge-offs of 22 basis points and a slight
increase in ACL coverage ratio to 1.41%. We achieved our near term target of 11% CET1 this quarter, in part by
returning $212 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. This return of excess capital drove
improvement in adjusted return on tangible common equity to 12%.
On slide 8, you will see that NII increased by $5 million as the margin slightly expanded by 1 basis point from the
prior quarter to 3.38%. The loan portfolio continues to be a tailwind to both NII and margin. Average loans are up
1.4% from the prior quarter. Roughly two-thirds of that growth is in loans to mortgage companies, which is our
highest yielding loan portfolio. Loan yields also continue to improve, up 6 basis points from first quarter, benefiting
from new and renewing floating rate spreads and repricing of fixed rate cash flows. Funding mix partially offset
that benefit from the asset side. Non-interest bearing balances were down on average, but encouragingly, those
balances have been relatively stable since March.
Deposit costs increased 2 basis points as late cycle mix shift continues within the interest bearing portfolio. We
dive further into deposits on slide 9. Seasonality and continued contraction in the money supply drove a 1%
reduction in balances in line with the industry's H8 data. Despite this, we have been successful retaining our
clients with a 95% retention versus the prior year. We have seen stabilization in non-interest bearing balances for
the first time in several quarters, which is illustrated with both average and period-end balances totaling $16.3
billion. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased 2 basis points to 3.3%. During the quarter
over $1 billion of balances migrated from lower cost base rate accounts into higher rate retention offers, which
increased the spot rate to approximately 3.35%, up 7 basis points from the end of first quarter.
On slide 10, you will see that the period end loans were up $1 billion or 2% from the prior quarter. The spring
home buying season drove an increase in consumer real estate as we continue to focus on balance sheet
production around the medical doctor program. Seasonality impacted loans to mortgage companies as well, but
we also benefited from competitive disruption in this industry, opening or increasing lines for more than 50 clients.
CRE loans also continue to fund-up though the pace of that is expected to slow in the coming quarters. As
previously mentioned, loan yields were up 6 basis points from first quarter due to wider spreads and fixed cash
flow repricing. Spreads on new loans increased 42 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect fixed rate
loan cash flows to provide opportunity over the next year with a roll off yield of approximately 4.6% on $4 billion of
cash flows.
On slide 11, you can see that the growth in our banking fees helped to offset the anticipated moderation within our
fixed income business. Fee income excluding deferred compensation decreased $3 million from first quarter.
Average daily revenue in our fixed income business stepped down to $488,000 resulting in a $12 million decrease
4

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
to fee income. The moderation in this quarter was driven by a reduction in the markets rate cut expectation and
lower portfolio restructuring activity. Absent a rate cut, we expect the rest of the year to be similar to this quarter.
Mortgage fees increased $2 million due to home buying seasonality. Service charges, card and digital fees are
both up $1 million each due to seasonal volume trends that tend to be higher in the second quarter.
We saw a $2 million increase in brokerage, trust, and insurance fees as second quarter includes incremental fees
for tax filing services within our trust department, and our wealth management fees benefited this quarter from a
higher market index. Lastly, other non-interest income increased $3 million, mostly due to incremental swap fees
and a gain from a tax credit investment.
On slide 12, we show that excluding deferred compensation, adjusted expenses increased less than $1 million.
Personnel, excluding deferred comp, was down $11 million from last quarter, mostly due to a reduction in
incentives and commissions. The $9 million reduction to the incentives was driven by lower fixed income revenue
and a step down in retention awards. Offsetting the personal decrease was a reinvest into outside services, which
increased $10 million from last quarter related to marketing for the new checking account campaigns and third-
party services for strategic investments.
As we have shared before, we still expect expenses related to our technology investments to moderately increase
over the remainder of the year. And we plan to offset those costs by continuing to identify and implement
operational efficiencies, which will allow us to keep the expense base flat to down in the back half of the year.
Credit continues to perform very well, as you can see on slide 13. Net charge-offs decreased by $6 million to $34
million or 22 basis points of average loans. Non-performing loans increased $69 million, with declines in C&I,
offset by an increase in CRE. Though NPLs have increased, clients are still managing through the higher rate
environment, with approximately 50% of commercial NPLs still current on their payments. Loan loss provision was
$55 million this quarter increase in ACL coverage slightly to 1.41%. Coverage on the CRE portfolio increased
from 1.26% in first quarter to 1.51%, largely driven by the office sector. Overall, we are pleased with how our
balance sheet has performed in this cycle and continue to believe [ph] credit yield is (00:11:37) very manageable.
On slide 15, we've revisited our NII 2024 outlook. At the end of last quarter, we guided to the lower end of our
previous range. However, due to mix shift and increased deposit competition that we saw late in the quarter, we
are updating our expectations for net interest income range to flat to down 2%. We are assuming a relatively flat
balance sheet in the back half of the year as we continue to remain disciplined on loan pricing and client
selection. The higher for longer environment in addition to heightened competition from new entrants into our
markets, has pressured funding, mix and deposit costs more than anticipated.
As I previously mentioned, we are pleased to see stability in our non-interest bearing deposits for the first time in
several quarters. However, we've continued to see more mix shift than expected within the interest bearing
portfolio. During the quarter over $1 billion of balances migrated from lower cost, base rate accounts into higher
rate retention offers. Our average base rate account yield approximately 50 basis points, while our retention offer
is roughly 4%. All other guidance remains unchanged, and we will continue to seek efficiencies to help offset
revenue pressures and improve shareholders return. Lastly, you can see that we've achieved our near term CET1
target of 11%. We plan to maintain the CET1 around that 11% level and we can reassess moving towards our
longer term target of 10% to 10.5% as we gain more certainty around the macroeconomic and regulatory
environment.
As you turn to slide 16, I'll give my closing thoughts. I'm extremely proud of the work that our company has
accomplished in the first half of this year. The macro economic outlook for 2024 has changed significantly in the
last six months. While there were previous expectations heading into the year of four or more rate cuts, now we

are looking at one to two. But despite all the changes around us, we continue to grow earnings per share quarter
after quarter. I believe that the experience and knowledge of our bankers, our teams and our leaders give First
Horizon, the flexibility to efficiently and effectively navigate any economic cycle. As we advance the second half of
the year, we continue to expect strong performance from our diversified business model.
We will continue to identify operational efficiencies to counter headwinds in revenue. We will also remain diligent
on managing our capital, our balance sheet and our credit performance in order to deliver attractive returns near
term and into the future.
Now, I'll give it back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. I echo Hope's sentiments. We have demonstrated our ability to execute in changing the
economic and competitive environments. We now know how to pull the necessary levers in order to operate
profitably. I have complete confidence in our ability to continue doing so, over the back half of 2024 and beyond. I
firmly believe that one of First Horizon's greatest attributes is our Southeastern footprint and our established client
base. While that attracts some of the greatest competition, I remain confident that we have the associates, the
client relationships, and the dedication to maintaining an unparalleled banking franchise in the South. As always,
I'm grateful for the great work of our associates in serving their customers and their communities.
In particular, our thoughts are with those in Houston impacted by Hurricane Beryl and the thousands that dealt –
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands that dealt for a long period without power. We remain committed to
supporting our associates, clients and the greater community as they recover.
Carly, we can now open it up for questions.

Ebrahim, your line is now open. Ebrahim can we check that your line is not locally muted? It appears that we can't

Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about the deposit pricing competition you're seeing? You flagged
late in the quarter and what are you seeing? Give us some examples of that and what do you think changes or
eases that environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I'll start and then Hope pick up from there. It's interesting to see the impact it had on our balance sheet.
There have been an increasing number of deposit offers that are specials across our footprint. We saw from large
and medium and small competitors and it had the effect of driving the higher cost in our existing customer base.
The number of customers who came in with an offer from somebody else at a higher rate and then our need to
match or come close to matching that rate picked up over the last month or so of the quarter. There was north of
probably $1 billion, $1.5 billion of that occurring in the third, the back half of the second quarter, third month of the
quarter.
If you've looked at deposit costs early in the quarter, our aggregate cost of deposits dropped early in the quarter,
was flattish in May. And then really accelerated in the June timeframe. And the proximate cause is this
competitive environment, which in the most narrow sense, we had to match the competitive offer to maintain and
defend customer relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, I'll add to what Bryan said. You asked about the offers. We have a very competitive offer from a marketing
perspective, from kind of a new entrance to the Southeast of a [ph] 5.30% (00:18:51) guarantee through year-end
and that's been aggressively marketed, walked into most of our branches and many of our employees here have
been kind enough to [indiscernible] (00:18:59) houses. And so that we saw kind of mid-quarter, as Bryan
mentioned, that competitive environment.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Going into the quarter, we expected a rate cut this quarter, a highly anticipated rate cut. So, everyone had pulled
back from their promotional rates. The rate guarantees that we were seeing was really three months. We were at
a three month rate guarantee and as the forward curve moved to a really late in Q3 expectation for the first rate
cut, we saw the offers, the marketing, the digital marketing from competitors significantly increased the longer
term and higher rate in the second half of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. If we don't get a cut, Hope, do you expect this kind of pressure to persist? And I guess, it's kind of clean
this up, talk a little bit about the higher end of the lower end of the NII guide and kind of what gets you to the
higher end or the lower end? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, I do think that if we don't get a cut in Q3 or this year, the further out that cut gets, the more competitive this
environment stays as the money supply continues to shrink out of the economy. I am hopeful that with that first
cut, we'll start to see some come back but as I mentioned, one of the major rate offers that our clients are bringing
in, it is a guarantee through year-end. So even if we were to see a rate cut in September, there's still an offer out
there that is valid through December at [ph] a 5.30% (00:20:27) rate, but hopeful that that will start to subside with
the first rate cut. Hopefully a second one not too far behind that.
As far as the guidance, absolutely a rate cut we hope will offset the deposit pressure, but we are asset sensitive
and so the earlier that we get the cut in the year, the more that in year we'll be able to kind of see the deposit
costs come down to match the loan side repricing. But the loan, 58% of our loan book will reprice in the month
and we'll have to work that deposit costs back. There'll be a little bit of lag as we walk that deposit pricing back as
well as promos that come off three months to six months rate offers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, I think it's largely a gut call at this point of what happens. I think it really depends on what happens with loan
demand, how the Fed normalizes its balance sheet, most importantly, and particularly, what impact that has on
deposits across the industry. The deposit market is still very tight and I don't think a cut or two is likely to change
that very much in the short-term. I don't think it makes it very much different if rates stay higher, but I think it's
going to be a competitive environment because the Fed is going through this normalization process and that's
going to keep deposit costs probably on the whole, more competitive than we might have felt three months ago,
two months ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael, your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just if I use the midpoint of the guidance you guys
are looking at negative operating leverage this year. I know it may be a little too early to kind of count or talk about
2025, but do you think positive – return to positive operating leverage next year is in the cards? And kind of what
are the factors, rates improvement in fixed income and momentum and fees, stuff like that that would kind of get
you there, I assume a little bit more balance sheet growth as well? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Michael, our goal is always to start with the intent as we put together a budget to have positive operating leverage
to manage our efficiency ratio year-over-year. And so at this point, it's really hard to say what's going to happen
with 2024, the rate cut environment right now, the forward curve has two this year and three to four next year. We
went into this year thinking four to six and we might end up one to two. So I expect 2025, we will work hard and
we will set a budget that has positive operating leverage. But I think that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty
going through 2025 on deposit costs as well as money supply. We still have an inverted curve, so our
countercyclical, specifically our capital markets fixed income fees needs to see that curve steepen and that will be
a huge help for us. We can see that start to flatten out to steepen at the end of next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. Maybe just as a follow-up as we do think about hopefully a better growth environment for you, you've
clearly benefited from some – a little bit of momentum in mortgage warehouse just as rates come down a little bit.
And we're back to a normal seasonal market. But C&I loan utilization is still relatively low. You've had some fund-
ups in multifamily and construction and things like that. Just Bryan, can you discuss kind of the demand outlook
and what you're hearing from your customers? Is it going to take a couple of rate cuts to see that utilization move
up and see some better loan growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, particularly, so back up to the first question. In a macro sense, to the extent that the Fed is reducing rates,
we think on the whole, that will help our countercyclical businesses and as Hope said, philosophically, we start
with – always trying to drive positive operating leverage and we have these countercyclical businesses.
In particular, I think our mortgage businesses will be [ph] helped as rates set (00:24:47) and the yield curve reset
and that yield curve starts to normalize particularly, if and when it starts to drive refinancing activity, which is likely
to curve as the shorter income's down and adjustable arms become more affordable. I think as we ended the
quarter, something like 18%, 19%, 20% of mortgage warehouse lending activity was actually refinanced. The rest
was purchase money mortgage. That tends to be more balanced over time. So to that point, I think you can see a
significant pick up in mortgage warehouse lending. And I think in all likelihood you'll see a pickup in mortgage
lending as the rate curve begins to normalize.
Broadly speaking, loan demand is more tepid than we would have thought at this point in the cycle, people are
generally cautious about investing. I think the twin mountains of change out there. What is the Fed going to do
9


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
and what's going to happen in the presidential and congressional elections? And what does that mean in terms of
economic policy? Because there is a lot of divergence between where our two presidential candidates are.
So at the end of the day, people are a little more tepid, but I think as rates begin to fall, I think people will become
more optimistic, both on a consumer level, particularly in the mortgage space, as well, as in the commercial
lending spaces.

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. Hi. Good morning. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. Just to follow-up on the question on loan
growth from Michael. So your updated NII outlook assumes a relatively flat balance sheet in the back half of the
year. Do you just talk about the drivers of the slowdown in loan growth you expect following a pretty solid quarter
you saw in the second quarter? I know you mentioned CRE fund-ups were slowing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Anthony. This is Hope. One thing that we've got that you need to look at is the seasonality of mortgage
warehouse. So, about two-thirds of the or half the increase a little bit more quarter-over-quarter on average is
mortgage warehouse, which seasonally increases in quarter two and quarter three is during the home buying
season and then kind of significantly tails off in Q4 and Q1. As a part of that is just the normal increase we have in
loan growth. We are reaching the end of or near the end of the large fund-ups we had in loans we originate in the
last two years in the pro CRE market, we're not really seeing a whole lot of originations in CRE as we continue.
So, we're kind of going to tread water in the back half of the year as we see paydowns, cash flows come in with
what new lending will be.

I do think as we as we go in though into 2025 and I know Michael's question earlier about is if there's a better
growth environment, if you get some rate cuts and the outlooks are better, I do think some of our, specifically C&I
clients, who may have put capital projects on the back-burner, we'll move those back to the front-burner. And
you'll see some opportunities with clients, who may want to reengage in some lending activity. And we stand
ready to work with those clients, assuming they meet our risk profile.

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. And then my follow-up, can you provide more color on the increase in outside services? You attribute
in the press release, this is tied to deposit marketing campaigns and third-party services for strategic investments.
I guess how much of the $10 million increase you saw sequentially is sticky versus one-time in nature? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Marketing is a seasonal spend there at year-end, and going into the new year, marketing tends not to be very
effective, especially with checking accounts. It just doesn't tend to be a seasonal time where we see a lot of
movement between banks. And so Q2 and Q3 are typically where we see more effective direct-to-client
marketing. And so I think I wouldn't say sticky as in year-over-year as there is some seasonality there. We did
mention in multiple previous calls that our technology investments were a little slower to get started the end of last
year and this year than we had originally anticipated. So, I think of the technology spend kind of hitting its run rate
now and the marketing being seasonal throughout the year, typical in past years as well. If you look back to last
year's earnings, you'll see the same type of seasonality increase in marketing in Q2 and towards the end of Q3.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes, maybe first question just around, Bryan and Hope on fixed income, I think you said the $40 million seems
like a good run rate for the back half. From what I can recall, just in prior cycles, rate cuts, it is countercyclical.
You should see a lot more bond book restructurings at your clients, et cetera, so I would assume that if the
September rate cut outlook firms up and the steepening of the yield curve should push that to pretty strong levels
would be my understanding. So, am I missing something there or are you just being conservative when you talk
about the cap market's outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I'll point you to there's a very pretty graph that Natalie put in the appendix, that sort of shows Fed funds and
what it does, the average daily revenues. And your instincts are right. To the extent that rates are moving down,
you're likely to see an impact on average daily revenue being up. And what we've talked about, there is a more
steady environment. We're not making any broad assumptions about the Fed making significant rate cuts,
basically following the forward curve. But on the whole, if the Fed is more aggressive in moving rates down, is
likely to be better than we've talked about for our fixed income business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess the other side of the other countercyclical business around mortgage warehouse, if we get Fed
cuts but mortgage rates remain around 7%, is that enough based on what you're hearing from your mortgage
warehouse clients to get activity and a pick-up in balances? Or is there a level of rates on the mortgage front that
needs to occur to get that business sort of momentum going?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I think you've got to see mortgage rates drop more significantly to see any real pickup in refinance activity. I
think you'll still continue to see a steady flow of purchase activity. But I think to see anything meaningful in terms
of refinance activity, you're going to see rates drop more than that. We have had a opportunity to pick up a little bit
of share by increasing lines and we think that will help maintain some stability and balances there. And we're
optimistic that, that's a business that's going to pick up nicely as the rate environment does normalize and get a
normally shaped yield curve.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And one last question, if I may. [indiscernible] (00:33:26) on deposit pricing sounds a lot more, I think,
circumspect relative to what I've heard from the banks so far this earning season. So one, I think, remind us, is
12


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
there a loan to deposit ratio that you're managing too, which is causing First Horizon to be a lot more active in
bringing in deposits or retaining deposits? And yeah – and am I over reading it? Because what we're hearing from
most banks is some cooling in deposit pricing, things repricing lower from three, six, nine months ago. So I just to
make sure I'm not missing anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think it's a couple of [indiscernible] (00:34:07). One is we are attentive to our loan to deposit ratio, but
that's not driving the deposit pricing strategy as much as it is protecting, defending existing customer
relationships. So we're thinking about it from a relationship side of things. And that's what's driving the activity. If
you look underneath the covers, I quoted some numbers about our existing customer relationships that
[indiscernible] (00:34:36). We also had a significant balance of customers where we were able to move the [ph]
rate back (00:34:43). It's just on the whole because of competitive dynamics in certain sectors. We saw a net
aggregate inquiry and deposit costs, but it was really driven by our desire to defend customer relationship.
Clearly, as I said, we will pay attention to our loan to deposit ratio, but we think we have the flexibility in our
balance sheet to support attractively – at least for me to say, attractively priced, well-structured credit and through
any cycles. So, it's not really constraining our ability in the near term. Not to say that, that won't change, but in the
near-term, we feel like we're well positioned to find customer relationships that make sense for our balance sheet.

Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We are a Southeast regional bank and I think everyone, with the exception of one that releases a national bank,
but most everybody is coming talking about the Southeast being target for growth. And so we are competing
differently than the national banks. When you look at multiple of our competitors and they talk about their growth
opportunities, they're talking about the Southeast, they're announcing new branches, they're announcing hiring
new teams. And so I think the Southeast allows us to grow more than the average on loans, but it's also become
more competitive on both the loan and deposit side as more banks are trying to increase their footprint or enter
here.
The second, on the loan to deposit ratio, as mortgage warehouse funds up in Q2 and Q3, we always see that drift
up. As I've mentioned before, we may have to go deeper into brokered or wholesale during that time, but being a
300 basis point yielding asset, I'm okay with that match funding and that loan to deposit ratio going up during the
two quarters there heightened line increases.

take down the capital ratios?

Yeah, I still think it's a 2025 question. We're not planning on changing our thinking about that in the near term. We

creates a soft landing for the economy, but we're prepared for something different than that. And until we see

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, this is Bryan, Casey. The short answer is probably not. And then in our view, the restructuring of the bond
portfolio really creates a lot of friction and doesn't really create anything other than a difference in the timing of

earnings. That discount or AOCI mark is going to accrete back to earnings or capital over time. And so it's unlikely
that that's something that we evaluate just simply because it creates friction that doesn't create a lot of economic,
it doesn't create any economic value over time.

Thomas Hung A

Yeah. Hey, Casey, this is Tom Hung. It was predominantly driven by our CRE portfolio, in particular office. What I
would point to, though, is I think the other performance is within the range of our expectations. I don't think there
was anything that was surprising to us. This is really kind of a – just driven more by the higher, the longer
environment wherein as well as macroeconomic environment. What I would point to is within our office CRE
portfolio, we continue to believe we have strong client selection and I think that'll certainly prove itself out in the
long run. Just kind of give you some high level information, 90% of our office portfolio by square footage at nine
storeys or less, and so, I think that speaks to kind of the profile of our office portfolio. In fact, we only have eight
buildings that are 10-plus storeys. And so I believe we're with the right projects, the right borrowers and the right
portions of office to have a good long-term outcome.

guys think about the math on buyback, kind of taking into consideration to that, that's a relative valuation but then
also a – in total, the math is a little bit different because the stocks are going up. I was just kind of curious, and
then if you do continue to buy back, could we theoretically see another reauthorization this calendar year,
because [indiscernible] (00:41:54)? So, I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on overall share repurchase

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. The buyback activity, we are thoughtful about price and relative value. And our expectations of long term
values, we think that even with the significant improvement in stock prices across the industry over the last few
weeks, we think we're still at a relative discount. And opportunistically we will continue to use capital to
repurchase shares. I don't know how to evaluate as we sit here today about whether we would reauthorize a
buyback this year or next. That's a board decision. We have plenty of capacity under the authorization that we
have that expires in January of this coming year, 2025. And so we will evaluate that as appropriate.
But we do think maintaining excess capital when we can return it to shareholders through a buyback is probably
more appropriate that we put it in the hands of our shareholders. And so we will continue to be opportunistic. We'll
look at relative valuations and we'll make decisions later on about whether we need to increase our authorization
or not.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q

Got you. That's helpful. And then Hope, I know you said expenses, in your prepared remarks, I think you said flat
to down in the second half of this year. I was kind of curious, there's always levers you can pull up virtually,
there's a pretty sizable franchise that you guys have. But is that pushing anything out into 2025 that could be done
today? I'm just kind of curious on how you get down relative to flat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Ben, good question. We do expect to be flat to down in the second half of the year. Part of that is in the –
as we've spoken about before, our bond business or FHN Financial had a really good Q1 and we had a high
revenue quarter and a high expense quarter. We expect that to come back down. We've had the TD retention, the
first step down in the back half of this year and we think we've hit the stride of our technology investments and so
we are looking at operational efficiencies.
We have in our adjustments a restructuring cost as we continue to look at ways to reduce our cost with a low
growth environment, how much head count do you need? Were you previously spending money with third parties
that you don't need to anymore? The environment has significantly shifted over the last year and we're looking at
every opportunity we can to be as efficient as we can and make sure that we have the – Bryan and I had talked
about it before. We're very focused on our efficiency ratio and not letting that grow over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. But there's nothing being push that – so I'm just trying to think about the hill to climb next

Hey, good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I wanted to just go back to the NII guide for one second. You assume a flattish balance sheet. And obviously, with
the loan growth year-to-date, you're kind of close to the middle of the guide you said and obviously, seasonality
and the LMC vertical isn't going to help for the second half of the year. So I'm just trying to ask, is there any sort of
mix shift assumption within [ph] that sized (00:45:52) balance sheet or should we think that, that loans and
securities and cash are all sort of staying relatively flat for the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sam, thanks for the question. When do you change your guidance, you run a whole set of scenarios and to
hopefully only change it once in the year. And so the answer is the zero. The flat to down 2% takes into account
all of the things that could happen and increasing deposit cost, a flat balance sheet, a slightly up, slightly down
balance sheet. And we feel that whatever is going to happen in the back half of the year, we will hit the new
guidance between flat and down 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then just on the deposit side, thinking about late this year, probably 2025 on
the sort of the non-interest bearing front, I wanted to get a sense for, I guess, where would you expect that growth
to return from the retail franchise into the commercial franchise? And what would have to happen for your
commercial clients to actually increase the dollars they hold in those NIB accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I think the answer is both. We've gotten front-footed on a checking account marketing campaign. We haven't done
that in years, really since the MOE and we saw a lot of success in the second quarter. And so we hope that that
will continue and we'll see stabilization in the non-interest bearing. And I also mentioned as we look at that,
there's a small amount of non-interest bearing, but also interest bearing. When we talk about the commercial
18

clients, we've talked a lot about our technology investments. One of the biggest investments we're making is
converting and upgrading our treasury management systems. And on the back half of that, we expect to convert
that – complete that conversion in Q3 and some into Q4. We do expect that we'll be able to attract and retain
clients and deepen relationships and attract new clients with our new and improved treasury management
system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think the opportunities for growth exist on both sides. And a Fed shrinking its balance sheet world, that
money is ultimately coming out of customer accounts too. And if you look at customer accounts, they've been
declining over the last several months and really going back a year or so. But we think there are opportunities. As
Hope, to grow both on the consumer side, we've got a checking offer that is showing very good signs early in the
process. We think the completion of the treasury integration effort will be very significant in terms of our ability to
continue to grow in the market, that product.
So, we're optimistic on both sides and as we've said a number of times, we're in a bit of a very attractive footprint.
It's competitive, but it's a very attractive footprint. And we think that gives us plenty of opportunity to invest in
some of these higher growth markets where we have, in many cases, smaller shares. And so we're optimistic
about our ability to invest and grow across this 12 state footprint.

So your question is that there is – can you repeat the question, Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Is there flexibility on your reserve? Can you reserve for CRE growth less than we just saw just because you've got
limited renewals and sort of address what you needed to this last quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I do believe that, especially as rates and rates have continued to – while they've been stable, if they come
down, we're going to see, I think, a good bit of relief on commercial real estate and actually C&I [indiscernible]
(00:50:10) everybody. And so we will see some healing there. I also think that we've been very proactive and on
the conservative side as we think about grading and we've done that for really the duration. And so as we've built
some reserves over time, I believe we're adequately reserved at this time. And at this time, we don't expect to
build. And are there opportunities to release as things moderate? I absolutely think there could be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thanks for that. And then just had a question for Hope as it pertains to the technology spend. I know you
mentioned that there was sort of slow on the pace as it accelerates. Is it going to be treasury management, things
like you've mentioned, or would it be upping other initiatives back towards the core at the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Early on, we have a three year plan and early on a lot of it was kind of what we're calling run the bank is end of
life systems like treasury management and GL, things that we had put on pause following the MOE integration
and following the 15 month dating and courting, we had that end up working out. Now as we're framed in that
most of that run the bank is getting through, we are doing more change the bank, more client facing in the back
half of our three year investment strategy. And next year we'll be talking about – this year we're talking about the
big two, which are GL and treasury management. And next year we'll share with you some of the big what we're
doing as well.

Jonathan Rau Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, this is Jon Rau on for Jared. I guess just if we could get a little more color on the migration into NPLs and the
office portfolio, I guess what portion of the increase in NPLs was from office in particular and has there been any
differentiation across geographies just on overall performance within the office portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Hung A
Deputy Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jon, this is Tom Hung. A large portion of the NPL increase is driven by office. I think that's probably not
surprising. But as I mentioned, I believe it's within the range of expectations that we've had based on what we –
based on the information we have about kind of the broader environment and the rate environment that we're in. I
would reiterate that I believe we've continue to show good underwriting and client selection. And so even as we
go into these deals, we certainly did always stress test the portfolio for potential rises in interest rates. Interest
rates change and vacancy rates and so on.
And so I think what you're seeing overall is just obviously as rates have been higher, the cushion has been
smaller. And so we've wanted to make sure we're always appropriately, if not conservatively, grading our portfolio
and hence, why you see some negative grade migrations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jon, I'll add a few things to what Tom said. This is Susan. I'll say – and you're seeing this just in articles that
are coming out from others and from just commercial real estate databases, some of the geographies that have
seen some weakness in the Southeast around office would be Atlanta, Raleigh. So a couple of areas in our –
some a little bit in some of the Texas cities. So – but again, these are more at this point, we still think of these as
kind of project by project and not indicative of a kind of an issue necessarily with a specific geography.
And to reiterate what Tom said, we've been conservative in commercial real estate underwriting for many, many
years. And so the upfront equity that we require across all types of commercial real estate projects is significant.
And so even with some drops in appraised values that we've seen as with reappraised properties, either because
they've been downgraded or there's a credit event, a maturity, we've not seen a lot of loss content there, but it's
something we continue to evaluate on a loan by loan basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Hung A
Deputy Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, we do watch it closely. And I would just add that in our traditional office portfolio, based on the information
we currently have, we're looking at an average stabilized LTV of about 60% on our office book. So, that still is a
pretty significant amount of cushion for any softness.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, the other thing I'll reiterate is what we said before is we reiterate our charge-off guidance. So NPLs are up
this quarter, 50% of them are current on payments and we still stand behind our charge-off guidance for the full
year.
