Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the first quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open
it up to your questions.
In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $47.2 million or $0.75 per share compared with earnings of $114.5 million
or a $1.79 a share reported in the same quarter last year. In a very challenging environment in which our bank
lobbies are closed, more than two-thirds of our employees are working remotely. Our team continues to serve our
customers at a very high level that Frost is known for and to execute our strategy of pursuing consistent above-
average organic growth.
In the first quarter, our return on average assets was 0.57% compared to 1.48% in the first quarter of last year.
Average deposits in the first quarter were $27.4 billion, up from $26.1 billion in the first quarter of last year. And
average loans in the first quarter were up to $15 billion from $14.2 billion in the first quarter of last year. Our credit
loss expense was $175.2 million for the first quarter, and that compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of
2019 and $11 million in the first quarter of 2019. In addition to the changes related to CECL, our credit loss
expense was elevated in the first quarter as a result of COVID-19 related business closures and also challenges
faced by our energy industry customers due to recent commodity price declines.
Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $38.6 million compared with $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019
and $6.8 million in the first quarter of last year. Annualized net charge-offs for the first quarter were 1.04% of
average loans. Non-performing assets were $67.5 million at the end of the first quarter, down 38% from $109.5
million at year end. Most of this decline came from charge-offs related to two energy credits we've been dealing
with for some time as they move through the snake towards resolution. Overall, delinquencies for accrued loans
at the end of the first quarter were $122.3 million or 80 basis points of period end loans. Those numbers remain
within our standards and comparable to what we've experienced in the past several years.
So the problem loans which we define as risk grade 10 and higher were $582 million at the end of the first quarter
compared to $511 million in the previous quarter. Energy-related problem loans were $141.7 million at the end of
the first quarter compared to $132.4 million for the previous quarter and $119.3 million in the first quarter of last
year. Energy loans in general represented 10.2% of our portfolio at the end of the first quarter, well below our
peak of more than 16% in 2015 and down from 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Clearly, we enter the current downturn from a position of strength, but we're not confused. The deterioration of the
economy brought on by COVID-19's pandemic will have a negative but manageable effect on our portfolio. We're
in the early stages of this downturn which is unprecedented in our lifetime. We don't know the link, we don't know
the ultimate resolution, we don't know the impact of massive financial and fiscal stimulus bought to bear on the
problem. But we do know that it will address these issues consistent with our culture and core values that have
guided us in multiple crises over our 152-year history. And while we don't have all the answers and outcomes, I'd
like to share a few data points we hope will be helpful.
We've identified seven portfolio segments, eight including energy, that we feel have higher than usual risk to the
current economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic. They include restaurants, hotels, aviation,
entertainment and sports, retail, religious organizations and associations and organizations. The total of these

portfolio of segments represents $1.36 billion at the end of the first quarter. There were $227 million in the
deferrals related to this portfolio at quarter end. The reserve for loan losses against these segments at the end of
the quarter was 2.25%.
Looking at energy, this portfolio totaled $1.57 billion at quarter end and carried a loan loss reserve of 6.58%.
Reserve-based borrowers represented 82% of the quarter end total. Significantly influencing our energy reserve
number was an oil price scenario of $9 per barrel for the remainder of 2020. This assumption was combined with
borrowers' plans to manage through the current cycle, hedge positions, cost structures, debt levels, other
secondary sources of repayment and other factors. A similar analysis was performed on non-reserve-based
borrowers. 57% of the production portfolio is hedged in 2020 and 32% in 2021, both hit prices in the mid-50s. The
average breakeven for the portfolio is $18.66 per barrel.
Our focus on commercial loans continues to be on consistent balanced growth including both the core component
which we define as lending relationships under $10 million in size as well as larger relationships while maintaining
our quality standards. Regarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these relationships went
from 53% for larger and 47% core at the end of 2019 to 57% larger and 43% core so far in 2020. The movement
towards larger loans year-to-date was mostly due to two large public finance transactions.
New relationships were off to a strong start in the first part of the quarter but were negatively affected in February
and March by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a decline of 16% compared with the first quarter of last year.
The dollar amount of new loan commitments booked during the first quarter rose by 6% compared to the prior
year. We continue to look at many deals, and in the first quarter we booked 13% more loan commitments from
opportunities compared with the same quarter last year.
In CRE, we saw the market become more liberal in terms of structure. Our percentage of deals lost to structure
increased from 76% this time last year to 91% in the first quarter of this year. Our weighted current active loan
pipeline in the first quarter was down about 30% compared with the end of the fourth quarter due to the effects of
the pandemic.
On the consumer banking side, we continue to see solid growth in deposits and loans. Overall, net new consumer
customer growth for the first quarter was 3.3%, up from 2.9% a year ago. Same-store sales, as measured by
account openings, were down by 1.1% through the end of the first quarter. In the first quarter, 33% of our account
openings came from the online channel which includes our Frost Bank mobile app. Online account openings were
31% higher compared to the first quarter of 2019. The consumer loan portfolio averaged $1.7 billion in the first
quarter, increasing about 2.6% compared to the first quarter last year.
Overall, Frost bankers have risen to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic and its resulting
shutdowns with a mix of keeping our standards and sticking to our strategies along with a truly remarkable
amount of flexibility and adaptability. We opened the 11th of our 25 planned new financial centers in the Houston
region in the first quarter and we have two more openings scheduled for May. Even if lobbies remain closed
through the new branches' scheduled openings, one of the new locations has a motor bank and will begin serving
customers on day one. We continue to hire talented experienced bankers as part of our Houston expansion and
we've already filled more than 170 of the approximately 200 positions expected.
I'll talk more in a minute about our efforts around the Paycheck Protection Program, but I wanted to note that
during the first round of funding this important small business program, Frost was number one in the Houston
market in terms of the number of PPP loans it got approved. In Harris County, we've helped nearly 2,000
businesses get loans for $616 million, and that shows our strong commitment to the Houston market and

reinforces our strategy of bringing our value proposition to more customers there. Later in the first quarter, we
began offering programs to assist our customers similar to the disaster loans and other relief efforts that we
implemented after Hurricane Harvey, and Frost announced that it would donate $2 million to non-profit agencies
assisting with pandemic relief in the areas where we have operations.
Just before the quarter ended, Congress passed the CARES Act which included provisions for $349 billion in
small business loans through the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP. We knew that Frost small business
customers would benefit greatly from PPP loans, so even as we closed our lobbies and set up our employees to
work remotely to protect them and our customers, we mobilized for the PPP application process. Even though the
SBA finalized this application with only hours to spare, we were ready to begin processing on day one and the
demand was tremendous. We received more than 9,000 applications in just the first four days. In comparison, we
process about 9,000 commercial loans in a typical year. But we dug in and the Frost bankers adapted with
technologies and they developed systems on the go, and through lots of hard work and many long hours we
wrestled PPP to the ground.
The initial funding was set up to last two months but it was exhausted in less than two weeks. Before that
happened, Frost received 14,000 PPP applications for a total of $3.3 billion. And because of the dedication and
commitment and effort of thousands of Frost bankers, more 10,500 of our small business customers, or more
than three-quarters of those applying, received SBA funding in the first round for $3 billion or 90% of the amount
requested. Based on our size, we projected we'd be fortunate to receive approval on about $900 million; instead,
we were able to secure more than 3 times that amount. That $3 billion represents continued paychecks for
workers and employers that have been affected by the pandemic.
Through this process, our small business customers learn the true value of having a relationship with Frost. Every
quarter, when we share our financial information and talk about the great work that Frost bankers do in executing
our strategies while taking care of customers, this time I can say that I've never been prouder of the work our
people do on behalf of our customers. I hope our shareholders have this same sense of pride knowing their
company is truly a source of strength for our customers and our communities and also a force for good in their
lives. It's what makes me optimistic that we'll get past the many challenges that remain. Our credit teams have
reached out to borrowers in our industries that are most affected by the pandemic. We continue to work very
closely with both commercial and consumer customers. We're keeping a close eye on the recent anomalies in oil
prices and the impact that that's having on the economy. We'll follow our best practices and public health
guidelines as we formulate plans to return to our offices and reopen our lobbies.
Our commitment to customer service was confirmed this month when Frost received the highest ranking in
customer satisfaction in Texas in J.D. Power's US Retail Banking Satisfaction Study for the 11th consecutive
year. We sometimes take these achievements for granted or consider them routine. The events of the past few
months should stand as a reminder that there's nothing routine about Frost and its culture. Now I'll turn the call
over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Today, I'm going to skip our usual comments about the Texas economy. Given the level of
economic uncertainty in the short-term, there wouldn't be much value in a macro comment at this time. I will point
out that it has been reported that businesses in Texas received more PPP loans than businesses in any other
state, and we're proud to have been a leading participant in that program as Phil mentioned in his remarks,
making approximately $3 billion in loans over a remarkably short period of time. We are now involved with the
second tranche of that program and we continue to assist our customers during this challenging time.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Now I'll turn to our financial performance in the first quarter. Looking at our net interest margin, our net interest
margin percentage for the first quarter was 3.56%, down 6 basis points from the 3.62% reported last quarter. The
decrease primarily resulted from lower yield on loans and balances at the Fed as well as an increase in the
proportion of balances at the Fed as a percentage of earning assets partially offset by lower funding costs. The
taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was 4.65%, down 23 basis points from the fourth quarter
impacted by the lower rate environment with the March Fed rate cuts and decreases in LIBOR during the quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $13 billion during the first quarter,
down about $678 million from the fourth quarter average of $13.6 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the
investment portfolio was 3.46% in the first quarter, up 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. Our municipal
portfolio averaged about $8.5 billion during the first quarter, up about $109 million from the fourth quarter. The
municipal portfolio had a taxable equivalent yield for the first quarter of 4.07%, down 1 basis point from the
previous quarter. And at the end of the first quarter, about two-thirds of that municipal portfolio was PSF-insured.
As we mentioned last quarter, during the fourth quarter we purchased $500 million in 30-year Treasury securities
yielding 2.37% and to hedge against falling interest rates. During the first quarter, given the volatility in the yield
curve we decided to monetize the gain associated with those treasuries and sold them, resulting in a pre-tax gain
of approximately $107 million. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was 4.6
years, down from 5.4 years last quarter and was impacted by the sale of those 30-year treasuries. Our current
plan does not include any material investment security purchases through the remainder of the year.
Looking at our funding sources, the cost of total deposits for the first quarter was 24 basis points, down 5 basis
points from the fourth quarter. The cost of combined Fed funds purchase and repurchase agreements which
consists primarily of customer repos decreased 26 basis points to 0.95% for the first quarter from 1.21% in the
previous quarter. Those balances averaged about $1.26 billion during the first quarter, down about $158 million
from the previous quarter. During the first quarter, we did redeem our $150 million in preferred stock, resulting in
the recognition of $5.5 million in debt issuance costs which reduced net income available to common
shareholders for the first quarter and results in the elimination of that $2 million quarterly dividend going forward.
Looking at our credit loss expense, the components of our total credit loss expense consisted primarily of $110
million for the energy portfolio, $34.8 million for the commercial real estate portfolio, and $22 million for the C&I
portfolio. Our energy reserve coverage at the end of the first quarter was 6.58%.
Moving on to non-interest expense, total non-interest expense for the quarter increased approximately $22.4
million or 11.1% compared to the first quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the Houston expansion and the
operating cost associated with our headquarters move in Downtown San Antonio, non-interest expense growth
would have been approximately 7.6%.
We are withdrawing our previous earnings guidance and will not be providing any EPS guidance for full year 2020
at this time given the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the pandemic including the potential impact
of future expected credit loss expense. I will say that given the Fed rate cuts in March and the continuing decline
in LIBOR rates, we do expect our net interest income and net interest margin percentage to decrease from their
first quarter level. We will see a positive from the impact of the PPP loans, but given the short-term nature of
those loans we expect that benefit to be relatively short-term as the fees associated with those loans will be
earned into interest income over the life of those loans.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
During our call last quarter, we did provide guidance around projected expense growth for 2020 over 2019. During
these uncertain times, we continue to focus on managing expenses including looking for ways to operate more
efficiently. As a result, we currently expect that non-interest expense in 2020 will grow at about 8.5% over 2019.
That's about 2% lower than our previous guidance.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, Brady. We did – from a linked quarter basis, yeah, we did have a pretty significant growth. We grew 4% on
period end so about 16% annualized. A big portion of that growth, if you annualize, it was related to our C&I
portfolio that was up almost 6.7% just actual growth, and if you annualize that almost 27%. And we did see some
increases in commercial lines that were drawn on during the quarter and especially during that time period,
leading us to March period end. We have seen some of that begin to subside, the pace of those draws. And I'm
going to say that was the bulk of the increase there. We actually had a decrease in energy between December
and March; they were down $84 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We also had some nice gains in the public finance area with some large deals, one related to a port in the state, a
very large one; the other one was related to a medical center, a large medical center HVAC. So both of those
things were also positives.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then when you look at the SBA's PPP, so you had $3 billion in round one. How much do you expect
to do in round two? And where does that fee come in? I think most banks are saying that's around 3%. Would that
be a fair estimate for Frost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It is. Our fee is running about that. I think it ended up maybe being a tad lower in the first round. But I think we're
seeing a little bit smaller balance in the second, and so I think it'll make it solidly in the 3%. As far as volumes, a
couple things are happening. One is we are making sure that we get through the best we can the applications that
were not processed in the first round. So our backlog there was somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000
applications, I can't remember the exact number right now, and so we're working on those. As we look at the
second round of applications which we may be at the point of processing those now, as of late last night we may
have started that, we've seen a little bit lower volume. We received about 2,000 applications as I recall. This event
ended yesterday with loan balances as I said being a little bit on the smaller side. So still good activity but not the
huge rush that was there at the beginning because I think a lot of larger customers, more sophisticated customers
had more visibility just in terms of their awareness of the program. So we saw a large rush in the beginning. As far
as where we're booking, the assets go into interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then finally for me. You mentioned 57% of the energy production is hedged in this year,
32% next year. Can you say those percentages are as a percent of the total production or those are the
percentages of your energy customers that just have some level of hedging?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Those are the customers that have some level of hedging.

Good morning.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just kind have maybe a multi-part question a little bit. Can you just talk a little bit more about the increase in net
charge-offs in the quarter but also layer in how much of that related to energy and certainly whether how much of
the energy reserve bill is related to specific reserves versus just sort of normal CECL reserves, if that makes
sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, first of all, the charge-offs for the quarter were heavily related to energy. There was, as I recall, $38 million
related to two credits who were non-performing and we describe those as been moving through the snake really
for a couple years now or even longer and were written down to values which at the time were based upon deals
that were on the table in one case and bankruptcy in another which there has been offer related to. Honestly, as
we're seen the COVID-19 pandemic impact and the reduction in volumes and demand usage for a while, I think
those values are certainly at risk, so that's really what that relates to. And both of those two credits now I think a
combined amount of $28 million, and so we're closely getting out of the snake but it didn't quite move through in
time for the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Just to clarify there. Our total was $38.6 million for the quarter, and $33.8 million of that was energy-related as
Phil mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, Jerry. $33 million. $38 million is the total.

And then in terms of specific energy reserve build versus more general CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We didn't book any specific energy reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm going to let Jerry speak to the CECL aspect of it which will include some overlays and few factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So what we did was our team ended up using the Moody's baseline forecast that was adjusted around the
middle of March that took West Texas Intermediate down to $35 flat for three years in that scenario; I think it was
called the S8 scenario. And then what happened was that Moody's continued to reduce that given what was going
on in the global economy if you will between Russia and Saudi Arabia. And so we were – and a pandemic started
coming in and so we decided that what we would do is we would use really more overlay than adjust or update
the usage of a zero point Moody's model, if you will. So our energy reserves that we created were primarily
related to overlays rather than specific reserves, and we can kind of talk a little bit if you like about the work that
we've done there. But that's what increased the reserves; it was not so much specific as much as more macro
sort of overlay-type stress test that we've done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And as they update their models to be more reflective of the situation with energy and the pandemic, we can see
maybe a reduction of overlays in...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Exactly. That would be our expectation. And just to give you a little bit of insight, and all of this is in our 10-Q and
we'll file this here this morning, but the stress testing that we've done on the energy portfolio assumed $9 per
barrel during 2020. And then we did create a sort of, I guess they call it an energy oversight council that became –
that was created towards the end of March, and they review the credit portfolio of all our major energy credits, and
so that group was very involved with what was done. And so they took the decision to go ahead and run those
stress tests assuming $9 in 2020 and then increasing to $36 in 2021, $40 in 2022 and $45 thereafter. And that
work that was done was what created the overlay, and I think the overlay in the energy portfolio was – Included a
few factors in the overlays; it was like $88 million. And still the expectation for us is that during the next quarter if
you will, when the CECL models are rerun we would expect that we would use more updated model inputs, and
our expectation currently is that a big portion of that overlay would be moved into more model-type results. But
we'll have to see what the model – that's kind of what happened during this first quarter.

Makes sense. And then just one follow-up. I think you said you brought your energy as a percentage of total loans
from 11.2% down to 10.2% of total loans. Just kind of how did you bring it down so much in the quarter and where
do you envision this going over the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think we had a little bit of an anomaly in the previous quarter; it's gone from basically 10% to 11%. I think it just
came down to a more normalized level based upon activity. If there was any one thing, we have been working to
reduce the exposure of the energy portfolio and we'll continue to do so, getting it below the 10% level. I'd like to
see it move more towards the mid-single digits over time, but that takes time to do because you've got credit
agreements in place that you've got to move through and what other charges and timing on all that. We're still
going to be in the business. As we said, we're going to be there with the best customers. In periods like this, we
call it pruning the hedge and we're going to continue to do that. So we're working hard to continue to rationalize
our exposure down to more in line with some of the other significant components of the loan portfolio.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And of course, as Phil mentioned earlier, we did have almost $34 million in charge-offs...

Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Hey. On the energy book, definitely appreciate all the color you gave there. And sorry if I missed this, but was just
wondering if you could give some background on how far along you are in the re-determination process and what
you're seeing in terms of how much lines are declining for customers and what utilization is at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. We're about – I'd say about a third through the re-determination process. It happens at this time of year and
what we've been seeing thus far is about a 13% reduction in valuations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
So the actual lines to customers have only come in 13%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's a reduction in the valuations. I don't know that – we've been working to reduce that over and above the re-
determination process. As Jerry mentioned, the energy council that we've put in place where we're talking with
customers, making sure we understand what their operating plans are, what their expense reductions are, cash
flow, etcetera. We've been pretty successful even before maturities at getting some line reduction, so I don't want
to say it all relates to the re-determinations but because it has been just working with customers as well as far as
we could look I guess on commitment levels and we see what the difference is there. But I don't have at hand
right now what the reduction is in that, but we can look over on the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And then how does that inform the reserve for the quarter? Do you sort of extrapolate results from that one-
third onto the two-thirds remaining that you're still working on and then you set the reserve that way or are we
going to see that incremental reserve flow into 2Q for the additional two-thirds you're working on now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, remember some of what we did in this first stage of CECL on the overlay was really based on a stress test
that had it based on $9 oil for the year, and I think that really at that point is where they use the reserve level
before the re-determination.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay, got it. And then for the two energy credits you talked about charging-off, what was the severity on those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
In what way? What do you mean severity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
In terms of the book value which you had in March. What was the percentage charge that you ultimately took to
resolve those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Those – it's pretty big on those. We've got somewhere around here the original amount, but they're charged down
– I would say it's at least three quarters on those. Those are...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
These are some of the credits I think Phil may have said that are making their way through the snake.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. They were put in place...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. They've had some pretty significant charge-offs associated with them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. As a rule of thumb as I used to report it, it's not our finest hour for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And then just backing up to the total loan book level. Could you just give a deferral amount, again, on the
higher risk bucket that you mentioned, the combined $1.36 billion I think it was that you mentioned? And then
what was the total deferral percentage for the entire loan book at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Well the deferrals for the higher risk bucket, and this is not including energy, would've been – and this was
added at the end of let's say April 23, $227 million...

of the $1.3 billion, 61 outstanding. And if you look at the deferrals for the entire company...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
They're about $1.3 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
About $1.3 billion
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's about 8% of our loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
8%, okay. And maybe just one last one on the NIM. In 2Q I know is when you'll get that full quarter impact of the
rate cuts. You talked about the trend there being down. Was just wondering if you could sort of bracket that in
terms of rough range or estimate in terms of magnitude of what you're expecting for 2Q, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think the only color I can give there really is I don't think any of us really completely understands how the PPP
loans will affect net interest margin, how quickly that'll be repaid. Some of our conversations internally, we talk
about potentially 75% of them maybe getting paid within, say, the first 10 weeks, but that's really just us trying to
figure out how all this will work. I mean, if we had some challenges obviously with some of the input getting into
the system, there's no secret there; I know there's a lot of credit associated with that. So we don't fully understand
yet how all that's going to play out as we move forward, but that would be a big – assuming that it worked out that
way, obviously you'd have a significant hit there from a positive standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester A
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. Any way to just estimate, backing that out because you're absolutely right. I mean, that's going to be some
noise into 2Q and maybe even 3Q too depending on when these things are forgiven or whatever happens with
those. So maybe just backing that impact out, any sense just from a magnitude perspective?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Yeah. I would tell you that if you back them out, and again, I think that our net interest margin, we were at 3.56%,
I think that full year we'll still be north of 3% is what our current projection is. But you're going to see some drag
especially between the first and the second; after that it's still levels out a little bit but you're going to see some
significant reductions in the NIM. Again, we're not making any investment assumptions. Of course, there's nothing
really to buy right now. We're really trying to make sure that we keep our liquidity as high as we can. And we have
not borrowed from the Federal Reserve under their liquidity program so, yeah, there's going to be obviously some
pressure on the NIM and especially with LIBOR going down as much as it has here recently. It was kind of nice to
have it at higher levels but it's moving down pretty quickly now.

outstandings $275 million; hotels, $239 million; aviation, $196 million. If you look at the public finance area, you're
looking at associations and organizations with $115 million. Entertainment and sports were $114 million; and retail

businesses, not the investor of real estate, but the retail businesses were about $86 million. So that's the
breakdown in those categories.

Are any of those SBA loans or...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We have some but not a lot of them. I mean, our portfolio of SBAs, if I remember it right it's in the [ph] $350 million
(00:41:25) range. So are you talking about PPP loans, Jennifer or are you talking about traditional SBA loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
No, regular...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Regular SBA? If you give me a minute, I might be able to pull that. I could've seen that somewhere. It's not a big
factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay, okay. And I've seen the hotels are mainly limited service type properties.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Some are. Our hotel exposure is committed. I gave you outstanding. Committed is $314 million. We've got 28
projects. We've got eight of them in construction, and the construction ones will be finished sometime this year.
Remains to be seen when they're going to open. We've got average loan to value on those properties is 64%, so
our owners are experienced, they've got a lot of equity in the projects. Good operators, a lot of Hilton and Marriott
flags. No gateway cities, nothing related to cruise ships or theme parks or those kinds of things. Four of the
projects that we've actually closed is $38 million of commitments that's actually closed from operations, just gone
dark on because they've seen [indiscernible] (00:43:11) levels get down to such low levels. So actually, we feel
really good about the portfolio. I think we're going to have some risk grade increases in our problems which
means you have increasing risk but really don't feel at this point we see any loss in that portfolio. Good sponsors,
many of which have good liquidity.

Restaurants, our commitments there – sorry [indiscernible] (00:43:47) we analyze mainly all commitments. About
$340 million commitments, $119 million of them have asked for deferrals at this point. Two-thirds of that portfolio

of committed dollars are associated with multiple format restaurants, multiple sites like franchisees with obviously
lots of locations. I think the exposure there, Jennifer, probably relates to the small restaurant that maybe isn't as
used to dealing with a take-out format, I'd say maybe borrowers that have less than $100,000 where you don't
have a lot of value in the collateral associated with it. It's not a big number; it's about $6.4 million for small
restaurants that are loans less than $100,000; obviously they add up a bit. But I think right now that's where we
see the exposure. The hard thing about all this is that the numbers that we're working with really are from third
quarter year end. We don't have audit reports for a lot of the companies, and even if you did, I mean, the numbers
look good for everything. So what we're doing is we're just having to analyze where we are and use our
experience just to estimate where these things are going to show up. So when I tell you the restaurants we think
it's under $100,000 and the portfolio is $6.4 million, that's true; it's our best guess of where we'll see it. But the fact
is we just don't know right. We're still waiting to see the impact.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I had a different topic but I just wanted to follow-up one on Jennifer's questions. Looks like you had some
downgrades in terms of problem loans outside of energy. Just curious about that and maybe can you touch on
maybe broadness and frequency of your loan grading process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that as we saw new problem loans, it was some of the larger ones, public finance-related
organizations that – maybe in the arts or the education area we saw some downgrades. Everything can be fine,
but we saw that. I'd say energy is the main area where we did see the increases in what we call problem loans
which are grade 10 and higher. As for the grading process, I mean, our officers are responsible to have the
grades and make sure they're accurate. We really want to avoid any double downgrades and then we measure
that out as we measure individual relationship manager performance, so they're responsible for keeping up with it.
And I didn't really notice anything that gave me much pause in the non-energy migration to the downgrades that

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
We can come back to that. Just on PPP, curious why you think you were able to secure 3 times what you
expected. And also wondering if you'd take a stab at how much of that 3-plus or $3 billion is maybe people that
are new to Frost, customers that are new to Frost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, first of all, our position was that we would deal Frost customers, so you didn't have to be a borrower but you
did need to be a commercial customer when it started out. And the reason for that wasn't – it was all based upon
what was the fastest way to get money into the community because if we were dealing with non-customers, we
would have to go through the federal government's regulations on BSA, AML, know your customer, and we really
didn't have any slack – we didn't cut any slack for anyone that I'm aware of in that area. And so the fastest way to
process the applications was to do it with people that we'd already known through that process with, and that's the
first thing as it relates to that.
The second thing I'd say regarding how we were able to do it as effectively as we did it's just, as I've said before,
it's just terrific people and an outstanding culture that has a culture of going above and beyond. We had over 500
volunteers and people that didn't do anything like this in their regular job and wanted to be a part of the process.
And inputs, applications at night from home, everyone is doing this stuff from home. But not just application
inputting. I mean, the completion rate, accurate completion rate of the applications that comes in, I'm really
surprised that it was 60% and so a tremendous amount of work had to go into contacting the customer, getting
information that might have been missing. Some cases we had suspicion that they had filled it out wrong based
upon how they've given the answers on the questionnaire. So we've spent a lot of time talking to customers and
getting those applications ready. And so being able to get 75% or so of the applications through I think was just
amazing because I guarantee you we didn't get 75% completed input-ready applications. And so there was
tremendous amount of working from home at late hours, around the clock. We've been doing this seven days a
week; we took the Easter Sunday off. And it's just been the grit, just grit of our people. I really think that what I've
seen, not just us but other community banks and other banks, I mean, everyone is trying their best but it's just it's
unprecedented, it's historic and truly really – it's heroic what we've seen and I'm just amazed at the success we've
had.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
To start, just a follow-up on an energy question. What were the problem loan balances at the end of the first
quarter? I think it was $132 million last quarter. And then what specific deferrals did you provide to energy
companies in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Problem loans would've been, at the end of the first quarter, $141.7 million and the previous, as you said,
they were $132.4 million at the end of the previous quarter. So a decline in risk grade 10s of, round numbers,
about 40 and an increase in the risk grade 11, looks like about I'd say 85 or so, so we had a little migration there.
We talked – as far as that, we talked about credit for the last two quarters that was really dependent upon asset
sales in order to – like the business plan work and they were fighting the issue that discount rates had gone so
high with the absence of equity in the business and private equity moving out of the market. You added that – on
top of that what's going on with this demand destruction of COVID-19, so you've got just discount rates being high
but also prices being low, so we saw some deterioration in that relationship. So that – I mean, most of that that I
just described, so that's – I think those are the most...

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. On energy deferrals, we've not seen really a whole lot at all. A pretty de minimis amount of energy
customers have asked for deferrals.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then – thank you. On the expense outlook being taken down for 2020, is that or
how much of that is related to the Houston expansion? Is that being slowed at all? Can you give some color
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. The – it's not related to the Houston expansion; it's just we're being careful on people that we're hiring.
We're reducing expenses really in all categories, just trying to be smart about it. As we do lose people and we see
– we're losing people for various reasons and we're just asking the question do we need to replace that position. I
think we're just – we're doing a good job there. We're continuing on with the Houston expansion. We've been
investing in that for the last couple years. I feel good about what's going on with regard to that. We were looking at
– it seems like ancient history now given everything is either PPP or COVID-19, but I'm really excited about the
performance we've had in Houston. If you look at our new household goal and where we are versus it, we're
146% ahead of our new household goal. And by the way, that's what I look at mostly. To get to that one, gets
taken care of; it just takes care of everything else.
We're 260% of our loan goal for our Houston expansion at this point in time. Our deposits are 68% of our goal,
but it has been improving. For example, if you look over the last three months, we're 108% of our goal for
deposits, and that's really because of the commercial side. The consumer side is actually, over the last three
months, 240% of our goal. And so the commercial side takes longer to develop where you can move a
relationship over but it takes a while for that operating business to really end up in your numbers as they move
and mature. So we're about 15% of our goal over the last three months in commercial, but I'm not worried about
that. That's our wheelhouse and I'm expecting that to go up.
And as we mentioned, The Business Journal, Houston Business Journal reported that we were the number one
PPP lender in that market from any bank including very large banks, the community banks, and I think that's
getting around in the marketplace. People are learning the value of a relationship. I had one customer mention
that they didn't realize when they decided to open a checking account 15 years ago if they would be making a
decision on whether their business will stay in business or not because they were able to get a PPP on through a
company that they have a positive relationship with. So I'm excited about the Houston expansion, I'm excited
about the performance that we've had. And it is – it's a tough market to do that in but this is a very strategic, very
long-term effort for us that we're showing success and not only success because we knew that if we could just
meet our pro forma goals this could be great. But in my mind we're exceeding that and I'm extremely happy about
it. I'm looking forward to getting past this pandemic situation and getting back to a more normalized environment. I
think we're really going to be able to trade off of our value proposition in that marketplace.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hi, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Most of my questions have been addressed. But Phil, you mentioned the bank's intention to reduce the energy
exposure over time to the mid-single-digit level. And it sounds like this could take a while, but can you talk more
about the driver of that decision? Was it made at the board level? And does this speak to the risk profile of the
asset class that isn't as favorable as it once was or does it speak more to the volatility of the stock price? Just
trying to understand the driver of this decision. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. No, it wasn't made at the board level. I've been talking about this, but keep in mind when I first started
talking about this we were at 16% going to 2020 probably. And so we stopped the growth, we made a decision to
move it down. We said we wanted to be between 10% and 13%. I think – and obviously move it down to 10%. I've
said in previous calls that I'd like to see a single digit handle on that. And one of the things as you refer to, I'm just
– came up on the finance side. I'm a big believer in asset allocation, right? Just pick any business and you can

pick the best stock in an industry segment that's not doing well and you're not going to do well even if you pick the
best stock. And so I think our shareholders sign up for less volatility with a company like ours. And if you looked at
the correlation of our stock price to the energy prices, we had the highest correlation of stock price to the price of
oil of any of our peers. And I just don't think that our shareholders sign up for that kind of volatility. I'm a big
shareholder; I won't sign up for that kind of volatility with a company like ours.
And so I think this makes sense that what we needed to be doing was not just throw in the long-haul around
energy but just like doing the ground game you've been talking about for a long time now. The core loans, it was
under $10 million, and also making sure that we're doing what our culture – what we say we do around
underwriting, making sure that we're really being conservative around all of our portfolios but including the energy
portfolio. So we've been moving that way. We've been talking over the last year about moving it down to the
single-digit levels as I have sort of referred in previous calls. And I think that there's – the next largest portfolio
segment for our company is probably around 6% or 7% in terms of its size. I don't think there's any reason for the
energy portfolio to be any larger than the next largest segment of our portfolio.
I just think it's a common sense view of what it represents for us and it really puts the onus on us to make sure
that we're doing the hard work of growing the rest of the business as well. I'll just say, even if that level, reduced
level it'll be a significant portfolio for us but with less exposure than we have had historically. And it's an important
business for the state and it'll be something I think that we're good at and we'll continue to do. But we have been
trying to and we are ready to reduce that exposure over time. But as I said, it's not something you can do laterally.
It has to be done in a smart way over time and in accordance with the lending agreements that you've got in place
and maintaining the great relationships that we have with a great number of great customers that we have today.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a couple of follow-ups. And then Phil, you previously
talked about obviously the organic expansion in Houston and your interest there. In a world where there is some
market dislocations and some M&A opportunities come up, can you talk to in terms of your interest level and like
is there something, like a distressed situation? Would you think about M&A in the current environment or are you
still rather go back to the organic growth that we were doing pre this crisis?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Ebrahim, I think that we're still focused on the organic growth for all the reasons that we have been asked.
A lot of that around brand, a lot of that around operational exposure. I think the pandemic introduced us some
other variables as well around credit, that type of thing. But, I mean, at the core it's still that strategic decision that
we've been able to create a brand that shown and demonstrated its ability to grow organically, and we just think
it's the best deal for our shareholders who have let us build the company with a brand like that to be able to
prosecute, even it though it does take some operational burn in the build-out period but it's a winning long-term
strategy and one that we really like to see the benefits of it go to the current shareholders that allowed us to build
that brand as opposed to paying – other companies that might dilute that. It continues to be our focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Understood. And then just one follow-up in terms of you gave out a lot of numbers around the energy book. I think
I heard you say that you assumed $9 in oil prices for this year and $36 next year. Is it reasonable to take that $36
and assume that if oil prices are higher like the power prices for next year above that mid-30, your portfolio is well-
reserved for based on this test and analysis that you performed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Did you say – did you assume that – yeah. Next year, if it's in the low 30s we'll see some – we're believing we'll
see some increased demand. I think one thing that you're seeing also with the disruption of production in the US,
one thing that we have to keep an eye on is are we going to see such a reduction over the next 12 to 24 months
that we see price movements up. So I think they tend to not be small movements, just small changes. And the
swing of volumes up or down tend to make fairly large price changes, so we're expecting to see some resumption
of usage and burn of current inventory and that's why we've got the $30 million for next year.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just two follow-ups. Looks like the total potential problem loans were up $71 million. Looks like about $9 million or
$10 of that was energy-related. What made up the other component of it and how much of it was in that higher
risk category that you mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I believe that the largest increase, the biggest increase that we saw there was the problem – was the credit that I
mentioned earlier and had mentioned for the last couple of quarters, [indiscernible] (01:07:40) reliant on sales of
property. And as I mentioned, when equity dried up in the market and you saw discount rates increase, it made
anybody needing to sell properties was under some stress and would be under stress, and we saw that. And then
as we saw prices go down, so not only our discount rates will have a price, prices are low, it really has hurt. What
was the operating model that credit had, so – and that as I've mentioned before, that one it's about $49 million of
exposure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one additional question on capital. You guys were really strong during the
great financial crisis and actually continued to increase your dividend. Can you just give us some updated
thoughts on the dividend and how you're thinking about buybacks at this point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Michael, I think at this point our focus will be around the dividend and the importance of that as opposed to
buybacks. I think you're going to see us lean towards the dividend as opposed to the buyback. I think we're going
to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think we've got $70 million left on a program that's authorized – I think it expires in July. We've made the
decision we're not going to do any buybacks under that program.
