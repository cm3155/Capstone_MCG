Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We began the year with a very strong quarter achieving net
income of $212 million. Our results reflect the continued recovery in economic activity, our diversified sources of
revenue, and prudent risk management.
Please turn to slide 3. Our quarterly net income of $212 million was $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and
$51 million lower than the same quarter of 2021, which included significant reserve releases. The sequential
variance is driven by lower expenses and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a lower benefit in the provision for
credit losses, lower net interest income, and lower fee income.
During the quarter, loan growth was solid and broad based, both geographically and across all loan segments.
Commercial loans grew during the period above BPPR and PB despite the continued run-off of PPP loans. Our
margins in Puerto Rico continue to be impacted by our asset mix. However, we are well-positioned to benefit from
higher market rates.
Credit quality trends continue to be favorable during the period with a low level of net charge-offs and decreasing
nonperforming loans. With increasing expectations to digitize and improve our customer experience, we are
constantly assessing and investing in our capabilities. In February, we entered into an agreement with EVERTEC
to acquire key customer-facing channels and to extend important commercial agreements. We expect this
transaction will allow us to enhance our client experience and provide us with greater flexibility to meet our
customers' needs.
During the quarter, we continued to return capital to our shareholders. In March, we entered into a $400 million
accelerated share repurchase program, and on April 1, we paid a dividend of $0.55 per common share, an
increase of $0.10 per share.
Please turn to slide 4. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by more than 6,000 in the first quarter to reach
1.96 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong.
Active users of our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million and have grown by 1.5% since March 2021 and by
19% since March 2020.
We captured two-thirds of deposits during the quarter through digital channels. This trend remains significantly
higher than during pre-pandemic levels. Commercial loan growth is solid during the first quarter, excluding PPP
loans, commercial loan balances at BPPR increased by $302 million or 4%. Auto loan and lease balances at
BPPR increased by 1% versus the fourth quarter, and consumer demand remains robust.
The dollar value of credit and debit card sales for our customers has continued to trend higher, increasing by 5%
compared to the same quarter a year ago. The housing market continues to be strong. However, mortgage
originations have been impacted by rising rates. The dollar value of mortgage originations at BPPR decreased by
28% year-over-year in the first quarter, but was more than 60% higher than the same period in 2019 and 2020.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macroeconomic environment in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico
economy performed well during the first quarter with business trends and customer activity remaining solid. Auto
sales increased by 1% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2021. This was the highest level of new
auto sales seen during the first quarter in more than a decade. The Puerto Rico Economic Activity index, which
includes total employment, cement sales, electricity generation, and gasoline sales has been steadily improving
and has exceeded pre-pandemic levels for more than the past five months.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
We are particularly encouraged by the positive employment trends. In March, total employment in Puerto Rico
reached its highest level in recent history. Additionally, the March 2022 unemployment rate of 6.5% is the lowest
since records began nearly 60 years ago. It is especially encouraging that the decrease in unemployment levels
was accompanied by an increase in the participation rate. Airport traffic also continue to improve. Passenger
volume during the first quarter increased 35% compared to the same period a year ago and also exceeded the
very strong traffic seen in the first quarter of 2019.
The tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength to the local economy. Puerto Rico is a
popular destination for mainland residents, and the recent increase in COVID cases does not appear to be having
the same impact on consumer demand for travel as prior surges have had. We believe that the recently
completed debt restructuring should be an important catalyst for Puerto Rico's fiscal and economic recovery.
In short, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We continue to be optimistic about the prospects for
the future, yet remain attentive to how the evolving geopolitical inflation and health situations may impact the
economy and our clients.
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more detail on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release detail variances from the fourth quarter. Net interest
income for the first quarter was $494 million, a decrease of $7 million from Q4. The variance spike was driven by
lower PPP related income and lower income from PCB loan repayments and BPPR, along with the impact of two
fewer days in the quarter. This was somewhat offset by higher income from loan growth at BPPR and PB as well
as a higher balance of investment securities.
Noninterest income decreased by $10 million to $155 million. The decrease in other service fees was mainly
related to seasonality in credit and debit card fees, which were lower by $3 million due to higher purchasing
activity in Q4, and $4 million contingent insurance commissions that typically happen in the last quarter of the
year.
Income from mortgage banking activities was $4 million lower, mainly driven by lower gain on securitization
activities resulting from lower volume of transactions and unrealized premiums. These negative variances were
partially offset by $3 million in higher income from investments held under the equity method. We continue to
expect that the average quarterly level of noninterest income will be around $155 million to $160 million. The
provision for the first quarter was a benefit of $16 million. This was $18 million lower than the benefit recorded in
the fourth quarter.
Total operating expenses were $402 million in the quarter, a decrease of $15 million from Q4. This was driven by
three factors. First, an $11 million decrease in business promotion expenses, primarily impacted by lower
expenses associated with seasonal advertising, charitable donations, and credit card rewards. Second, an $11
million decrease in other operating expenses driven by lower sundry losses by $5 million, mainly related to the
termination of a white label credit card contract and the $5 million impairment losses on undeveloped properties
taken in Q4.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Finally, a $5 million decrease in amortization of intangibles due to the write-down of a trademark in Q4. These
decreases were partially offset by a $7 million increase in employment compensation cost, mostly driven by
higher incentives and commissions, as well as seasonality in payroll taxes that increased by $4 million, a $4
million increase in credit and debit card processing expenses due in part to lower volume incentives, and a $3
million increase in professional fees. For 2022, we continue to expect our average quarterly expenses to be
around $415 million. We will, of course, strive to come in below this expected level of expenses.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. In 2022, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 18% and
20%.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $548 million, $4 million higher than
in the fourth quarter. Net interest margin decreased by 3 basis points to 2.75% in Q1. On a taxable equivalent
basis, NIM was 3.05%, an increase of 3 basis points. The increase in FTE margin was driven primarily by higher
yields on our investment portfolio by 17 basis points due to asset composition and improved market rates.
During the quarter, average balance of US treasury securities increased by $4.2 billion, while the average balance
of money market investments decreased by $3.1 billion. The FTE loan deal decreased by 20 basis points in Q1 to
6.06%, driven by lower PPP amortization. PPP income in Q1 was $11 million, down from $23 million in the prior
quarter due to lower recognition of fees upon forgiveness and lower balances. The yield of the portfolio was 17%
compared to 17.9% in Q4. The outstanding quarterly balance of PPP loans was $173 million. The remaining
unamortized portion of fees for this portfolio is $8 million, most of which we expect to recognize during the second
quarter.
Excluding public deposits, deposit balances grew by $4.1 billion in the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter,
public deposits were roughly $15 billion, a decrease of $5 billion from Q4. While the aggregate deposit outflow
associated with the completion of the Puerto Rico's debt restructuring was approximately $10 billion, we saw $5
billion additional public deposit inflows during the first quarter.
We now expect public deposit balances to fluctuate between $11 billion and $15 billion, slightly higher than our
prior estimates. The outflow of public deposits and the deployment of a portion of our cash position into loans and
investments have reduced our asset sensitivity, but we will continue to benefit from rising rates. As of March
2022, each 25-basis-point change in Fed funds would correspond to $6 million to $8 million in NII per quarter.
Our ending loan balances increased by $344 million. This increase occurred despite a decrease of $180 million in
PPP loans. Excluding the impact of PPP, loan balances grew by $524 million in Q1, reflecting higher commercial
loan balances at BPPR and Popular Bank, higher construction balances and to a lesser extent, higher auto and
personal loans.
These balance increases were offset in part by continued runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio in Puerto Rico. We
are encouraged by the demand for credit at BPPR and PB as net growth has occurred earlier than expected. We
will continue to take advantage of the evolution of the economy and the opportunity to extend credit so we can
continue to improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity.
Please turn to slide 8. Capital levels remain strong. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q1 was 16.3% compared
to 17.5% in Q4. Tangible book value per share in the quarter was $51.16 or a 22% decrease, driven by four
factors. $1.1 billion higher accumulated unrealized losses on debt securities available for sale as a result of rising
interest rates. The impact of the $400 million accelerated share repurchase program the corporation entered into
in February and declared quarterly common stock dividends. This was partially offset by the quarterly net income
5

of $212 million. The lower mark-to-market valuation of our investment portfolio will not have an impact on our
regulatory capital ratios. While this is a large variance in tangible book value, the decrease in fair value of the
investment portfolio should be temporary. Our investment portfolio is nearly entirely comprised of treasury and
agency mortgage-backed securities, which carry minimal credit risk. The bond portfolio has a duration of
approximately four years and as the positions grow down the yield curve, their fair value will converge to par and
they mark down to zero.
Despite extension of some cash into the investment portfolio over the last few quarters, we continue to have large
cash balances. Continued extension of available liquidity into the investment portfolio would lead to higher
earnings and improved tax effective markets in this interest rate environment. Our return on tangible equity was
16.4% in the quarter. As a result of the ASR, we recognized in shareholders' equity approximately $320 million in
treasury stock and $80 million as a reduction in capital surplus. The final accounting treatment of the program will
depend on the average price of the shares during the term of the ASR scheduled to close in Q3. Our EPS in Q1
increased by $0.03 as a result of this transaction.
Our capital planning schedule should result in an announcement of Popular's 2023 capital actions no later than
our January 2023 webcast. The announced intention to redeploy the net gains expected from the sale of our
EVERTEC stake is subject to the closing of the transaction and regulatory approvals. As of now, the closing is still
expected for midyear. We will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital structure through the
remainder of 2022 and in future periods.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos and good morning. Overall, Popular continue to exhibit strong credit quality trends and low
credit costs with low levels of net charge-offs and decreasing NPLs. We continue to closely monitor changes in
borrower performance and the pace of economic recovery, given the rising interest rate environment and
geopolitical uncertainty. However, we remain optimistic given recent credit performance, economic outlook and
improvements in the risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolio.
Turning to slide number 9. Nonperforming assets decreased by $22 million to $610 million this quarter, mainly
driven by an NPL decrease of $28 million, offset in part by an OREO increase of $5 million. The decreasing NPLs
was mainly in Puerto Rico. This was driven by lower mortgage NPLs of $26 million, primarily due to the combined
effects of collection efforts, increased foreclosure activity, and the ongoing low levels of early delinquency
compared with pre-pandemic trends. In the US, NPLs remained flat quarter-over-quarter.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, NPL inflows, excluding consumer loans, remained flat. In Puerto Rico,
total inflows increased by $5 million, driven by higher commercial by $4 million and higher mortgage by $2 million.
In the US, inflows decreased by $5 million, driven by a $7 million reduction in the mortgage portfolio as the prior
quarter included the impacts of loans that did not resume payment after the end of the COVID-related
moratorium. The order increase in the quarter was driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the Puerto
Rico mortgage portfolio. At the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio was 1.8%
compared to 1.9% in the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 10, net charge-offs amounted to $4 million or our annualized 5-basis-point of average
loans held in portfolio compared to a net recovery of $8 million in the previous quarter. The variance in net
charge-off was mainly driven by the resolution in Puerto Rico of certain commercial nonperforming loans in the

prior quarter. The corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by $18 million or 2.5% to $678 million, driven
mainly by reductions in qualitative reserve due to substantial improvements in employment levels in Puerto Rico.
The ratio allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased slightly to 2.29%, compared to 2.38% in
the previous quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPLs held in portfolio was 130% compared to
127% in the prior quarter.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $14 million compared to a benefit of $31 million in the previous
quarter. In Puerto Rico, the provision for credit losses was a benefit of $12.7 million, while in the US, the provision
was a benefit of $1.7 million.
Please turn to slide number 11. The [indiscernible] (00:20:35) allowance for credit losses was driven by changes
to qualitative reserves and economic outlook, as well as portfolio credit quality and mix. During the quarter, we
released $26 million from our qualitative reserves driven by improvements in employment levels in Puerto Rico. In
accordance with its usual practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics completed its annual benchmark revision to the
establishment survey employment series, which yielded significant improvements in better employment. As a
result, we released qualitative reserves associated with uncertainties due to the employment situation in Puerto
Rico after COVID.
Changes in economic scenario driven by fiscal assumptions caused the ACL to increase by $4 million. However,
the macroeconomic scenarios for Puerto Rico and the US continue to show a positive outlook for the economy.
Portfolio changes driven mainly by credit quality, portfolio growth, and volume mix caused the ACL to increase by
$8 million.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited strong credit quality metrics with low net charge-offs and decrease in
nonperforming loans. We are optimistic given recent credit performance, economic outlook, improvements in the
risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolios.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. Popular started off 2022 with a strong quarter, building on the
positive momentum seen in 2021. Our results were driven by strong earnings, improved credit quality and
continued customer growth. Our planned capital actions reflect this strength. In addition to the unprecedented
level of federal stimulus related to COVID, Puerto Rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds
that have yet to be disbursed and which now have begun to flow at a faster pace.
We expect that the combined impact of these factors, along with the continued progress on the resolution of
Puerto Rico's fiscal issues, should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years,
and we are well-positioned to benefit from such activity. We are optimistic about the economic outlook, yet
cognizant of the possible challenges to the environment resulting from the war in Ukraine, inflation, and the
ongoing health situation.
I am thankful to our entire team who have continued to perform at a high level and deliver results under a myriad
of changing conditions. We continue investing in our people and in January increased the minimum wage pay to
our employees across all our geographies. Our employees are Popular's greatest source of strength. We are
ready now to answer your questions.

I may have just missed that, but constantly hunting for economic and employment data in particular about the
island. Could you review the actual number that you're citing in terms of the employment improvement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The unemployment rate was 6.5%. And the participation rate, I didn't say it specifically, but it's 44-and-
change-percent, an increase about 2-and-change-percent from our prior reading.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And in terms of the government deposits, I guess just two questions. One you had framed out the
impact of that runoff as, I believe, 4 to 5 basis points of NIM benefit for every billion. Is that still reasonable? And
should we see that in Q2? And I guess, secondly, what would drive that range in terms of [ph] 11 to 15 basis
points down to the low or sticking it at 15 basis points (00:25:10)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The range still applies Brock that we mentioned earlier. What's going the drive the change in that – the
balances within that range is, normal operational activity of the government which means that for the second
quarter since for example, they get all the tax receipts in the second quarter we should end up in the higher end of
that range. Normally during the rest of the year, the government spends money and they have less inflows. So the
balance should come down during the rest of the year. They will have now for the first time in five years, six years,
debt payment at the beginning of July. That is new as well.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
So our best guess right now is that it should go – should be higher end of our range in the second quarter and
then come down after that. The thing that may – that affects that balance in ways that is very hard for us to predict
is the arrival of some Federal funds. So sometimes, we get surprised in the upside when a particular program is
triggered and a big slug of Federal funds arrive. But normal flow of business should be around the highest at this
point in the year and should gravitate down from here.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Starting on the loan growth, two quarters in a row of positive net growth. I heard your comment that this is coming
sooner than what you had been expecting, which was for kind of net growth in the back end of the year. I'm
guessing, how does the loan growth outlook change, if at all, given these last few quarters? Should we expect
accelerating growth as some of the stimulus money begins to find its way into the economy, as some of this
existing growth in the fourth and the first quarter here kind of preemptive in anticipation for increased economic
activity and rolls off. I guess, how do you think about loan growth going from the year with these two good
quarters in your pocket now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the – definitely loan growth has a lot to do with confidence in the economy, and I think there's a
lot of confidence in the economy right now, especially in the larger players. So a lot of the loan growth we saw in
the larger commercial loans both in the US and in Puerto Rico. So it's hard to predict because those loans are
lumpy, but we definitely have not seen any deceleration of the interest from our clients. There's a lot of activity
going on. There's a lot of people looking at different possibilities, acquisitions, investment. So it's a bit lumpy
because these loans are large, but we certainly don't see any deceleration of the loan demand at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just looking at the swing in AOCI, could you just maybe talk through some of the internal
discussions about potentially having moved some of the portfolio into a held-to-maturity status during the quarter?
And then the duration you said is four years. It's a pretty straight line, should we assume about a quarter of the
9

portfolio runs off annually and kind of extrapolate that on a quarterly basis. Or is there some difference in the pace
of cash flow on that book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
There was no substantive discussions of us moving the portfolio to held-to-maturity during the quarter. We have
historically held the portfolio in available for sale, so no significant expected change there. The portfolio maturities
are pretty well-balanced as we move forward. So – and when we add to the portfolio as well, Timur, we tend to
layer in all our future maturities a little bit as opposed to add a big chunk in any given maturity. So, we have a
quite balanced portfolio.
Your guess of a quarter of it every year, Juan P will comment on. Juan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Juan Pablo Pérez Hanley A
Treasurer, Popular, Inc.
Yes, this is Juan Pablo, the Treasurer. In terms of maturity structure, I'd say around 38% to 40% mature within the
next three years and then another 30% kind of between years three and five. So again, as Carlos mentioned, the
portfolio has laddered out, all the way out to six or seven years. But again, the bulk of the exposures are kind of
like in the belly of the curve.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Wanted to ask about fee income and mortgage specifically. It seemed like the MSR mark didn't – that rates given
where rates have moved would have been more significant. Can you maybe talk about mortgage, the MSR? And I
think if I heard you correctly, $155 million to $160 million kind of guidance for quarterly fee income. It seemed like
you've got some movement there and other with the equity piece. So, it would seem like there could be some
pressure to lower into that, but I want to make sure I understood how you're thinking about the guidance for fee
income as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The guidance for fee income is unchanged. As you know, there's a lot of moving parts that add up to that
number of $155 million to $160 million, and any given quarter, things go – come up and down. One of the reasons
we keep the guidance at the aggregate level is that a lot of those things that happen tend to cancel out from
quarter to quarter. So you end up with similar levels even though specific lines may be a lot more volatile. We still
feel comfortable that this is the correct range moving forward in this environment. Now, when the transaction with
EVERTEC closes, we will make some adjustments to that range, yes. But we – that hasn't happened yet so we
haven't made any adjustments yet. There will be some adjustments to the rate moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And any thoughts on the MSR and mortgage overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. On mortgage, I mean, we are seeing trends are not dissimilar from everybody else is seeing in the country.
When rates go up, the refi rate goes down. So we still have a very healthy housing market in Puerto Rico, but one
of the challenges is finding a house to buy. There's very little offer of units in the island, and that makes the new
market somewhat challenging. So, lower – there will be – we expect to have, as we did in the first quarter, lower
volumes than last quarter. As a result, we'll be securitizing less loans, and the fees from that will be lower.
The MSR, you know my view on the MSR, Brett. The MSR does what the MSR does. And there's the – the effect
of rates [indiscernible] (00:33:35) the effect of extension on it. So, different things will affect at any point in time.
So, I take that more as a fact than as a something that we try to forecast or hedge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Fair enough. And then the other thing I really wanted to talk about was, I've been looking at all the data
economically and it's been very strong. And you point out some of the numbers on the call so far this quarter, so
far this year. And I mean, this looks really to me like this is going to be the first year where Puerto Rico in many,
many years has had – it's going to have low-single digit positive GNP growth. And it doesn't seem to be anything
underlying that even despite higher energy prices, potentially impacting retail spending et cetera, employment
continues to be stronger, yet it doesn't sound like you guys are taking a very bullish view on the economy, more of
a wait-and-see or cautious approach. Can you give me any color around that and how you're viewing the year and
if it's just that everybody is sort of nervous about the yield curve implications et cetera, global stuff, or maybe you
can provide a little color on that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
I don't like – I mean, maybe we didn't express it clearly. But I think we're very optimistic about where the economy
is. I mean, the Puerto Rico economy today is as good as anyone has seen it for a long time. And again, to me, the
most important one, the most important is employment. And really, it's – we have more people employed today
with a lower population than we had a decade ago. So, I think the biggest headwind to the economy that we're
concerned about is external to Puerto Rico. It's not internal. It's what happens in the Ukraine and what that does
to inflation and supply chain.
But, really I think the Puerto Rico economy as you said, is positioned to grow, more solid than it has in a long
time. And right now the consumer remains healthy. Our customers have a lot of liquidity. Really, the biggest
problem we have is, as like many people, is hiring across the board and Puerto Rico, is staffing people for the
growth. But I think we're very optimistic about the Puerto Rico economy. I think there are some legitimate
concerns about external factors, Ukraine, inflation, logistics, all that kind of stuff. But in terms of Puerto Rico, we're
very optimistic.

Brett, our average retail client balance is up 50% from where it was pre-pandemic. So the consumer seems to be
still a very strong position. Do keep in mind that Puerto Rico will benefit from an extended application of the
Federal Child Tax Credit, and that should add some additional liquidity to the market starting this month. So there
is still positives that keep giving us a tailwinds and we are positive on that.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Any – I think you mentioned on healthcare – any thoughts on Supreme Court decision to disallow the
several hundred thousand people with the Medicare benefits this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, it's very disappointing. Keep in mind though, that we didn't have that benefit until very recently when the
appellate court – in fact, I don't know, they never implemented. So it's not a benefit that we lost. It's – that we
hadn't lost. It's a benefit that obviously would have been very important to us. It's disappointing. We're hopeful that
the administration will be able in the next two years that they have left, or at least before the midterms before the
Congress changes, get some of those benefits through legislation. But again, remember, that is not something we
hadn't lost. That is something that the courts, the Congress had never given us and the courts, the lower courts
ruled that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against Puerto Rico and the Supreme Court reversed that.
We have had a lot of additional benefits, though. The Child Tax Credit, which is something Puerto Rico only
participated in marginally. That has been a very large benefit to Puerto Rico. So, I think that's very important, and
I think that has helped households in Puerto Rico deal a little bit with the inflationary pressures. It's a lot of money
vis-à-vis the average annual salary in Puerto Rico, the Child Tax Credit.
Again, there is a lot of money out there. I mean, stimulus is not our problem. Our problem is more to get it out as
estimates of the hurricane recovery fund is more than $50 billion yet to be spent. There is different legislation for
COVID relief, some estimates have about $10 billion left to be spent. We have the infrastructure bill that had
about $2.7 billion in the next five years, another $1.2 billion after that. So there's a lot of money out there yet to be
spent. How much will be spent? I don't know. This is more – the supplemental Medicare is more a human rights
issue than, I think, an economic impact issue.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Carlos, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that at the end of March you indicated that a 25-basis-point
increase in Fed fund rates would lead to about a $6 million to $8 million increase in net interest income. As part of
that comment, if the Fed raises Fed funds rates 50 basis points, let's say next month and possibly a second time,
can you share with us what that would do? Is it an automatic double to that number or is it not that linear?
And then second, as you look out through the remainder of the year and if the forward curve is accurate, I assume
the $6 million to $8 million for every 25 basis points is not linear. And because the deposit betas and other things,
that benefit might diminish a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's – in the short term, you can assume that it's reasonably linear. It will not necessarily be as you
move later on the year, in part because there may be other changes in the balance sheet as well that may adjust
it. But in the short-term, if next month is 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points, it should be something in the
ballpark of twice the range we gave, yes.
But if you try to think about how that may affect the rate change in September or in October, that number may be
somewhat different, but we'll update this commentary in every webcast that you'll get an updated version.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

Very good. And then you were talking earlier about the investment securities portfolio and the duration. I know in
the average balance sheet you give the yield for both, money markets in trading and investment securities

together. I think it was 135 basis points. What is the yield in the investment securities portfolio today and what are
you now seeing as you invest money into that portfolio? What's the new rate that you're receiving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I'll have Juan Pablo answer that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Juan Pablo Pérez Hanley A
Treasurer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Right now, the portfolio – the bond portfolio, excluding the cash is around 135 basis points. You know at
the margin, you got to think that right now depending on where you're purchasing stuffs, anywhere above –
between 250 basis points and 275 basis points is where marginal funds are being deployed at this point in time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then finally, I...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Juan Pablo Pérez Hanley A
Treasurer, Popular, Inc.
Just to [indiscernible] (00:42:02) the other thing and that is tax exempt for us. So the actual after-tax yield is quite
higher than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. You guys talked about the growth in commercial lending in the quarter. And can you give us a little further
color? Is it C&I lending, commercial and industrial lending? Is it commercial real estate mortgages that you're
seeing the growth in? And is it primarily in on the island or is it here in the mainland?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think we saw that in both markets. I don't know Lidio can put some more color on it, but we saw strong lending in
hospitality sector, in the multifamily sector in the US. So really, really across the board, we had construction
lending was up also. So it was really across the board in both geographies. I don't know, Lidio...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
It's pretty balanced, too, Gerard. Commercial growth in Puerto Rico was about 161 basis points and in the States
was 135 basis points. So it's actually pretty balanced. Last quarter it was much more heavily weighted to the
Popular Bank than Puerto Rico, but this quarter was a lot more balanced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, just finally in the commercial mortgage portion, with the 10-year backing up the way it did in
the month of March, was there any change in what your guys on the front line are seeing, meaning commercial
real estate mortgage folks are not looking to do as much activity right now or is that no, it hasn't really affected
them?

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A couple of questions here. So, with the new range on the government deposits, the $11 billion to $15 billion,
does that change, and with obviously this bankruptcy kind of now in the rearview mirror, does that change your
willingness to actually activate some of those deposits? I know that you're kind of sitting on a big chunk of them
for a long time, kind of unsure what was going to flow out. But now that we have a little bit more clarity, could you
take some of that $10.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and maybe at least invest a little bit more in the
securities portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, we have been adding to securities portfolio every one of the last three or four quarters, I think, Alex, so
we've been doing some of that. You are correct that some of the uncertainty about forward-looking balances has
now gone away. So, we will continue to look at our cash position and investment opportunities. The investment
15


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
opportunities are obviously a lot more attractive now than they were a few quarters ago. So, our willingness to
extend this is probably getting better because we find them more attractive now. So this is where our ALCO
committee does on a weekly basis. So, we will definitely continue to extend and with less uncertainty on our
balance sheet and better investment opportunities, we'll consider extending more than we have in the last few
quarters on average.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Have you done any so far during the second quarter that you can share with us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I don't recall on the second quarter, Alex, but you should assume that we will do some in the second quarter as
well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, when we talk about loan growth and we talk about the hurricane money that still is – has kind of
been slow to come to the island, you can kind of really parse out from some of the programs. Big chunks of
money they've been allocated to things like affordable housing. And just some of the R3 program and the
investment portfolio for growth. And if you look at the numbers that are publicly available and you just – you see
the projections have been pretty strong going forward. But a lot of that money is really yet to be spent. In the past
you've talked about kind of planning and permitting. It was maybe last year and now this year you're starting to
see a little bit of commercial growth. Are you seeing any of that related to some of these HUD programs? And if
not, do you think that there is – do you have a line of sight onto sort of when some of those programs might come
online?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
It's hard to get a line of sight because of a lot of internal negotiations and processing going on between
[indiscernible] (00:47:12) in the Federal government. We are starting to see it. You're right. They're starting to
come out slower than we hope. I mean, they just announced the first recovery project for the Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority, a $2 billion project it was finally built.
There is a lot of proposals. I think the last time I read, LUMA and the Power Authority have 16 projects in front of
FEMA to be approved. So it's going to the project. I think the housing with the CDBG funds is moving a little bit
faster. They have disbursed the money. But again, it's – we can't hide the fact it is slower than we would have
hoped.
The one thing that I do think the political realities are that, as the Biden administration enters their halfway mark, I
think there's going to be real pressure on the administration to get more money out, because obviously they were
very critical of the way the Trump administration handled the funding for Puerto Rico. And really, the first two
years it really hasn't dramatically increased that much. So I think just the timing, they're processing it further
along. A lot of work has been done. I think there'll be political pressure on the Federal Government to show some
results, especially they were highly critical of the Trump administration.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
They should make some progress. Now, that's the positive side. A little bit on the negative side is all the – all
these logistical challenges and inflationary challenges complicate the process of buying the stuff for projects,
some of these specialized equipment I read somewhere, it could take two to three years for deliveries. So, the
logistical challenges are real.
That said, I mean, the money is starting to flow not as fast as we want, but again the economy is doing very well,
sort of without that big inflow. So keeping a little bit of that reserve is not necessarily a bad thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
As an example, the government announced today that they are trying to negotiate with Federal authorities for
them to allow the equipment that is involved in some of the projects that will be built in – to rebuild the electrical
sector to be purchased ahead of the final granting of the contracts. Because the way it is now you actually have to
wait for the contract to be granted to order the equipment. As Ignacio said that equipment may have a lead time
normally of 8 to 10 months maybe, and nowadays maybe two years. So trying to get ahead of some of that. So
that's the kind of logistical discussions that are going on. Hopefully, they will be resolved positively so we can get
more of those projects going quicker.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And theoretically, if someone wanted to purchase a big piece of equipment with the two years ahead of when a
contract might be executed, is that something that they would need a bank loan to help facilitate that purchase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, it depends who you're talking about. Again, the equipment that will be the, let's say, like the power stations
that's going to be bought by LUMA or the Power Authority with Federal funds. However, a lot of the work will be
done by private contractors, and those private contractors will have to buy trucks and equipment they use to
install the stuff. Now, the infrastructure itself is going to be funded by Federal funds. But again, much of the work
will be done by private contractors who will have to buy equipment and that kind of thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's helpful. Just a couple of sort of follow-up questions. The 25 basis points equal $6 million to $8 million per
quarter, kind of what's the difference between that $6 million and the $8 million? Is it really liquidity from the
government that defines those two kind of ends?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Largely, the difference between two ends was $20 billion (sic) [$20 million] (00:51:27) in balances versus
what we thought was $10 million, which is now – looks like – more like $11 million to $15 million, as we
mentioned. So that is the biggest delta. There's some other things that will swing it, but that is the biggest delta,
yes.

Okay. So, if it's $15 million, then you're probably looking at around $7 million per rate per quarter? And that, just
correct me if I'm wrong, that's just the short end, right? That makes no assumptions on the long end of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
That is correct. And as I mentioned earlier, it is fairly lineal in the very short term. But as we get out of quarter two,
that number will probably change, okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then, on the expense guide, which is unchanged from last quarter, is that reflective of the
renegotiation of the EVERTEC contract?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Now, the expense guide, it does not include that yet because that transaction has not closed. Once that
transaction closes...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
...we will update our guidance to reflect any changes that are necessary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And that takes the CPI escalator from 5% [indiscernible] (00:52:35) 0% for this year, right, so that could have
some decent savings in the back half of this year. Is that – am I thinking about that correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Assuming that everything close as we are assuming right now, that will provide some savings in the back end of
the year. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, how should we think about the $100 million of buyback authorization that you left out of the
ASR? Can you give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking about how that will be utilized over the
remainder of the year?

We are still going through that analysis and making decisions on it. We are considering this together with our
expressed intent to redeploy some of the gains from EVERTEC. So, the size and timing will depend on a number
of things. So, we are still working through that. We haven't made any decisions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just to clarify, the capital ratio that really matters for you guys in your mind is the Common Equity
Tier 1. And when we see the leverage ratio or even the tangible common equity ratio kind of decline as a result of
the size of the balance sheet or if things like the AOCI hit, does that have any – is that something you guys pay
attention to at all when you're thinking about capital actions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I mean, remember, the AOCI has no effect on our regulatory ratios. So that didn't change the regulatory ratios.
We continue to have very healthy regulatory ratios. And at this point in time, we have no reason to think that we
would change the way we look at capital return.

Hi. Thank you so much for the question. Just carrying on the topic of the buyback remaining. When you
announced EVERTEC, you said you would be repurchasing kind of the post day one gains on the remaining sales
of EVERTEC shares. Is that incremental on top of the $100 million you already committed or is that – are they
kind of one and the same?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A

Okay. Thank you for the clarification. And then I guess with credit, I mean things have – you had another negative
provisioned, things have continued to strengthen and get better and [indiscernible] (00:55:31) qualitative reserve.
As we kind of look out, net charge-offs have been really almost negligible. Have you guys considered at all what a
normalized charge-off ratio looks like now on a go-forward basis, given all the relief money that is yet to be
disbursed? And kind of thoughts around that. Thanks.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Kelly that's I would say a difficult question to answer, but I will say that prior to the pandemic and all the money
that is coming into Puerto Rico, the normal range of charge-off for the corporation was between 75 basis points to
125 basis points. I mean, it seems like the new normal or in the short to medium term would be a little bit lower
than that range. So that's what we view of the part of the new normal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right, thank you, that's helpful. And then maybe just the last one for me. I really appreciate all the color
around asset sensitivity. Just wondering on kind of what you're baking in for your expectations for deposit betas.
Do you expect it to follow a similar cadence as the last time around or given the fact that you guys all have so
much liquidity. Do you think you'll be a – perform a bit better and that goes into that NII outlook for each 25 basis
points. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Remember that we have two pieces to our deposit beta. The deposit beta in the US bank and deposit beta
in the Puerto Rico bank. The deposit beta in the US bank is much – looks a lot more like any other $10 billion
bank in the eastern shore of the United States. So it's closer to changing market rates. In the case of Puerto Rico,
historically, deposit betas have been lower in both directions than they have been in the mainland. You're correct
that there's a lot of liquidity. So, just thinking that they will look like last time is not unrealistic.
Now, what we do not know, Kelly, is especially how clients are going to react to a very fast increasing rate,
especially commercial clients are the most sensitive and the most attentive to that. So, if commercial clients start
looking at opportunities to invest, reinvest the cash in a different way, then that could affect the beta negatively.
But as a starting point it's not unreasonable to think that they will look like last time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. That's really helpful. And just a small follow-up for me. Do you have a sense of or just like approximate
breakout of to your deposit base of retail versus commercial?

Oh, thanks. Just a follow-up to that credit string of questions. Is there any – just trying to dimension where the

percentage of loans over time?

under CECL, another important factor is the economic forecast. So, when you look at the trend, it seems that
everything else being equal that we're seeing lower releases of reserves on a month-to-month basis. So, we are
sort of like getting close to a plateau, but then, you have the factor related to the economic forecast. If that
changes, then there could be significant impact to the reserves.

Okay. Nothing new there. On nonaccruals, a lot of that, I think 75% is resi mortgage. Is there some guidance
where we should expect just an ever-present large component of resi mortgage just because of the way the
market is on the island? I'm just trying to dimension the potential increases ahead in non-performers.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
I mean, that have always been the case of our business in Puerto Rico. NPLs have mostly and largely been
residential mortgage loans, and that is in part due to the fact that the foreclosure process in Puerto Rico takes
very, very long. So I would expect going forward that that will continue to be the case.
