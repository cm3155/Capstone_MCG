Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason;
and Treasurer, Mike Verdeschi. Today's call will be hosted by Tom Rogers, Head of Fixed Income Investor
Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you
will be given instructions for the question-and-the-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being
recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Mr. Rogers, you may begin.

Thomas Rogers
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Maria, good morning, and thank you all for joining us. As Maria have mentioned, I'm joined this
morning by our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason; and our Treasurer, Mike Verdeschi. In a moment, Mike will
take you through the fixed income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website,
citigroup.com. Afterwards, Mark and Mike will be happy to answer your questions.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and subject to uncertainty and changes in
circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements
due to a variety of factors including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those
included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly
discuss our 2019 operating results. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends, including growth in loans
and deposits. Third, I'll review our issuance program; and finally, I'll discuss our continued strong liquidity and
capital position.
Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. In 2019, we reported net income of $19.4
billion and achieved an RoTCE of 12.1%, ahead of our target.
On slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars. On this basis,
we have grown our balance sheet by approximately 3% over the last year as we continue to leverage our global
footprint to raise high-quality deposits across our Institutional and Consumer businesses to fund growth as we
deepen relationships with clients. Sequentially, our balance sheet remain largely unchanged.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to grow deposits and issued long-term debt to fund loan growth. Trading assets
and liabilities declined given typical seasonality and we grew investments as we optimized the balance sheet.
Slide 5 presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans
increased 3% year-over-year and 4% in aggregate across our Consumer and Institutional businesses. In our

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Consumer franchise, average loans grew 4% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in North America and
Asia. Average loans in Mexico were unchanged year-over-year, reflecting lower overall industry volumes.
Overall loans on the Institutional side grew 3% year-over-year. Breaking that down by business, TTS loans
decreased 3% year-over-year as we continue to utilize our distribution capabilities to optimize the balance sheet
while supporting our clients. Loans in Corporate Lending decreased 2%, reflecting the episodic nature of our
clients funding needs, as well as an active quarter in debt capital markets originations. Private Bank loans
increased 13%, reflecting growth across regions, driven by both new clients as well as the deepening of
relationships with existing clients. Finally, strong year-over-year Markets loan growth was primarily driven by
residential and commercial real estate warehouse lending. And loans included in Corp/Other continued to decline,
driven by the wind down of legacy assets.
On slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolios. As a reminder, this quarter we
realigned our commercial banking business with all commercial banking activities now reported in ICG, including
those previously reported as part of GCB. In GCB, overall credit trends remain favorable again this quarter. In
ICG, non-accrual loans increased sequentially but remained low at 56 basis points of total corporate loans.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars. Total
deposits increased 9% from the prior-year period. In our Consumer business, deposits increased 6%, driven by
continued growth in North America and Asia. In North America, deposit growth accelerated to 7% with
contribution from both traditional and digital channels. In our Institutional business, deposits grew 10%, primarily
driven by high-quality deposit growth in TTS.
Now, let me highlight our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide 8. In 2019, we issued approximately
$16 billion of parent-level benchmark debt across a variety of tenors, currencies and structures. Last week, we
issued just over $2 billion. Going forward, we will continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors,
currencies and structures.
On slide 9, let me cover our bank note issuance program. In 2019, we issued just under $9 billion of bank notes.
And going forward, we will continue to maintain the flexibility to issue across a variety of tenors, currencies and
structures as we drive the efficiency of our funding sources.
On slide 10, let me cover our issuance, maturity and redemption expectations. As I mentioned, during 2019, we
issued $16 billion of parent benchmark debt with $16 billion of maturities. At the bank level, we issued $9 billion of
bank notes with $12 billion of maturities across both bank notes and credit card securitizations.
Looking to 2020, we expect gross issuance in and around $25 billion in aggregate across our parent benchmark
and our bank level programs, including the roughly $2 billion we issued last week. And we will maintain the
flexibility to optimize our funding through opportunistic redemptions.
On slide 11, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, our total long-
term debt increased by approximately $7 billion to $249 billion, driven by issuance out of our non-bank entities.
On slide 12, we provide an update of our LCR metrics and drivers. Our average LCR increased modestly to 115%
this quarter.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Turning to slide 13, let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics. Our CET 1 capital ratio increased
sequentially to 11.7%, driven by a decline in risk-weighted assets. And our SLRs were 6.2% and 6.8% for
Citigroup and Citibank, respectively.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize several key points: First, we earned $19.4 billion of net income and
achieved an RoTCE of 12.1%, ahead of our target for the full year. Second, we maintain a strong capital and
liquidity position with a CET 1 capital ratio of 11.7% and an SLR of 6.2%, an average LCR of 115%, and an
estimated NSFR of greater than 100%. And we maintained a surplus above our TLAC requirement. Finally, we
continue to further diversify and optimize our liquidity resources.
Before we move on to Q&A, let me touch briefly on the transition away from LIBOR. Broadly-speaking, we are
continuing to prepare ourselves by working with our regulators and industry working groups such as the
Alternative Reference Rate Committee. As I've mentioned previously, we have several work streams which are
focused on the transition related to a number of areas including the impact on our clients, operational capabilities
and legal and financial contracts. We are scoping our contracts for the re-papering efforts that will be required to
both transition to new rates and ensure that fallback language is robust. We are encouraging adoption of industry-
led protocols and solutions in order to ensure consistency where appropriate. We are making markets and new
risk-free rates as well as supporting the transition of legacy derivatives portfolios. And, lastly, we've issued
benchmark bonds referencing SOFR from both the bank and the parent as well as preferred securities, which will
reference SOFR once the fixed interest rate period ends.
With regard to the unique language in the subset of our preferred securities, we are continuing to evaluate
alternatives, including a potential exchange or amendment. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to get
more clarity on the various implications of a potential transaction, including industry feedback received from the
SEC in the fourth quarter. And while we are not yet in a position to speak to a specific transaction or timing, we
are continuing to make progress, working through the alternatives and we'll continue to provide you with updates.
And with that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hima Inguva of Bank of
America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my question and Happy New Year to Mark, Mike and Tom. Always helpful
that you do these calls and I hope that other banks definitely follow the trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Hima.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
So I'm going to start off with actually the – I apologize if I couldn't find this, but the breakdown between parent
benchmark debt and the bank level debt, if you're willing to provide that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so, Hima, over the last couple of years, if you look at what we've issued, go back to 2018, we issued $30
billion and that was broken down evenly between the bank and the parent. Last year, we issued $25 billion, and
we issued less in the bank than we had done in the previous year, and the benchmark was roughly the same.
This year, we are indicating in and around $25 billion, and at this point it's hard to know exactly how that split will
break down. It really will be a function of how our balance sheet evolves and grows and what our client needs are.
But if you look at the last two years, it gives you some sense of how those levels between those two programs
can vary.

Operator: Our next question comes from line of Scott Cavanagh of APG.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
[indiscernible] (13:09) as always. So on the issuance, specifically just looking at the maturities versus the
issuance expectations on slide 10, what is the incremental issuance at the parent? Was that just balance sheet
growth or how should we be thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, Scott, it's Mike. I would say that there's a number of things that is always going to impact how we think
about that issuance activity. It is going to be a function of how the balance sheet grows and how our clients
engage us. Obviously, we think about TLAC as well and we're running a good-sized buffer right now. But over the
course of the year, that will decay. And then, of course, we'll be thinking about market conditions, and market
conditions right now are favorable. So we'll be looking at a number of factors and that will really drive how we
issue over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnold Kakuda of Bloomberg.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg LP (Research)
Hi, guys. Once again, thanks a lot for the call. Really helpful. So this question might be a little hard to answer but
– and I'll give it a shot anyway. So concerns about the coronavirus are growing. And as a global banking
institution with about 12% to 19% of your loans based out of Asia, you might have a unique perspective on –
currently, what are you seeing now? And maybe if you can give some context of what did you see maybe 17
years ago with SARS?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi. It's Mark. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg LP (Research)
Good. How's it going?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Good. As you described, that is a tough question to answer. I guess I'd address it in this way: Our primary
concern, as you would imagine right now, is for the health and well-being of those impacted and we don't have
any presence in Wuhan. That said we do have operations in China and across the region. We have a continuity of
business plan that's in place today. We're obviously focused on the safety of our employees and have taken a
number of actions regarding restricting travel in order to ensure the safety of all employees. It's a fluid situation
that we continue to monitor closely and will continue to do so over the coming period of time.
With regard to the coronavirus, that's really all that we can say at this point. It's a situation that we're taking very
seriously and we're very focused on health and well-being.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Frost of State Street Global.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Frost Q
Analyst, State Street Global Advisors
Hi. Thanks for taking the call, the question. I think you touched on this, the FICC-related results in last quarter that
seems to be more calendar-related. We shouldn't look at that as a sustainable level. I think that's correct but
correct me if I'm wrong on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So we did in the fourth quarter we saw very good FICC performance on the heels of a prior year, as you
know, at the end of 2018 where there was serious pressure from an industry point of view on activity in Markets
broadly. And so that strong performance is a byproduct of, we think, very strong continued engagement with our
clients. But on a tough comparison from the – or a very poor comparison in terms of the prior year's performance.
We do feel good about the engagement we're seeing with clients across the Fixed Income franchise and we do
expect to see continued strong engagement as we grow there and take share there. But the performance is a
byproduct of that rebound, in part.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley of UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning and thanks for doing the call again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Robert.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. A couple things on asset quality and one on preferreds quickly. Could you give us an update on Flex
Loan and Flex Pay? How have they been performing so far, getting what you want out of that?
Also, in the equity call on asset quality, you spoke about episodic downgrades. When do these become a pattern?
Are you starting to see any patterns there? And then, finally, on preferreds, you have a few issues that are
callable near the end of the year, given the low rate environment, the success you had with the recent issue, have
you thought about bringing a call or anything like that forward on those? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So why don't I take the first two, and then, Mike, you can touch on the last one.
So with regard to Flex Loan, so I guess I'd start by saying we feel very good about the execution we've seen in
our North America Consumer strategy, in particular. We're getting, we think, very good traction in growing our
penetration of our Branded Card customers. We think we're getting very good traction in the way of demonstrating

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
our digital capabilities as we've seen our digital deposit sales grow 7% on roughly $6 billion in digital deposit
sales. We also feel good about applying those digital capabilities to how we expand our lending offering.
And so as you referenced, in January we launched Flex Loan. Flex Loan allows our customers to access funds by
converting a portion of their existing credit line into a fixed interest payment personal loan. The results continue to
be positive. Loan originations continue to grow. We're maintaining a strong credit profile.
In April, we launched Flex Pay. That allows customers to select certain larger purchases or groups of certain
purchases and pay for them over time. And while it's still early, we also there see good initial results and again
while maintaining a strong credit profile. So we feel good about those two products, but more broadly we feel
good about the progress we're making with our North America Consumer strategy and the capabilities we're
demonstrating on the heels of having made investments in our digital capabilities.
With regard to the episodic downgrades on the Corporate side that you referenced, look, when I look at the
performance in our Corporate Lending portfolio and the cost of credit that we have for the full year there, it is in-
line with what we've talked about in the way of a normalized level of cost of credit. So it's right in-line with that. We
did see a couple of episodics in the fourth quarter but again that aggregate level is consistent with what we would
have expected. And when I look at loss rates there, they are very, very low; and again, inside of the range we
would have expected. We continue to have and focus on a high-credit quality customer. So north of 80% is in
investment grade in the way of the client focus that we have, and we aren't seeing anything in particular that is of
major concern. We obviously continue to watch very carefully in light of where we are in the cycle, but we aren't
seeing any systemic areas of concern as we continue to monitor activity and the portfolio we have.
Mike, you want to [ph] comment on (21:30)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, sure. In terms of preferreds and I would say similar to how I think about the broader issuance, we're always
going to be monitoring and evaluating market conditions. And that will be a factor, but then again, of course, we'll
be actively looking at the balance sheet needs and the growth of that balance sheet. And, therefore, what does
that mean for our capital needs? And right now, we're maybe running a bit high on AT1 relative to where we could
be running it but I would say that this is going to be an ongoing evaluation. We'll be looking at both issuance from
an opportunistic perspective but also looking at the needs over time.
And then certainly as it pertains to our call, we'll always look at whether we do need the capital at that time and
whether we wish to just call it away. And if we do need the capital, we'll look at the economics associated with
leaving that particular preferred outstanding versus calling it and reissuing at the then current market levels.

Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Hey. Good morning. Just two questions. Just, first of all, on the digital deposits gathering effort, to an extent if you
are more successful there, can that help kind of credit some of the issuance at the bank level and is that strategy
there more focused on providing services rather than just kind of rate paid and being a rate-high payer?

And then my second question was with the issuance of the 20-year by the Treasury later this year, could that kind
of change some of the [ph] tenures (23:21) that you would focus on [ph] in terms of (23:24) at the holding
company level? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Mark. In terms of our bank issuance program, again, as I said earlier, we're going to be looking at a
variety of factors that can impact the bank. And we'll look at market conditions and we'll look at the needs of the
balance sheet. And if you look at over the past couple of years, we did issue a bit less in the bank last year than
we did in the previous year. And some of that was influenced by, I would say, the good momentum that we saw in
deposits. And that was true in the retail bank, but it was also true in our other businesses that we've mentioned
before.
In terms of digital, the focus really there is about engaging our Consumer customers and thinking about that as a
holistic engagement of that customer base.
And so what we want is a full offering of products for those customers and digital is just part of that strategy. As
we think about our deposit base, we are raising deposits both from traditional channels in the six major markets
that we operate in but utilizing digital capabilities allows us to grow deposits outside of that footprint. It allows us to
grow deposits with a broader customer base that we have in our Consumer Bank. So it is not about rate; it's more
about engaging our clients from a broader perspective.

Just a quick one for me, guys, on LIBOR. And definitely I echo everyone's appreciation for these periodic updates.
But you mentioned the SEC response to the ARRC letter that came in December. And I think it was the last call,
last quarter you talked about the IRS and Treasury guidance that came out, I'm just wondering what other sorts of
sort of dominos may be out there that we should be looking for as the industry progresses and as you kind of
contemplate dealing with the legacy securities via amendment or exchange?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Sure. It's Mike. And, look, there's been a number of factors that have come out and we're actively evaluating all of
those. It's hard to know what else may come through. But I would say what we're broadly looking at is
understanding the implications of our alternatives that I've talked about, an amendment or an exchange. And
some of those alternatives could be the impact of whether that transaction can be deemed extinguishment or
whether that's just a modification. So that was a key.
And then also the adoption of, I would say, a lot of the legacy language in the protocol. Those are all things more
broadly that the industry is still working towards. And I would say that continues to be an evolution.
From the preferreds perspective, again, all this information that continues to come in just ensures that we have a
good line of sight in terms of how we evaluate our potential options, and that's both for us and our investors. So,
again, we just want to make sure we're taking a thorough evaluation of it and that we continue to operate in a way
that's consistent with industry standards.

Jeff Bernstein Q
Analyst, Insight Investment
Hi. Three short questions. Hong Kong exposure, would we expect in 2020 the rate of growth to decline or do you
have a specific target as to what you might want to get to?
Second thing, the [ph] size (27:38) change in the FICO calculations, what kind of impact you think that will have
on you guys, if at all or what kind of reaction you might have to it?
And, lastly, on the LIBOR question, a little different angle, how would you handicap the possibility that it remains
quoted after the current drop dead date?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Right. So why don't I start on Hong Kong. So, look, we've been in Hong Kong for over 100 years. We've
monitored the situation there over the past number of months. In terms of the underlying performance, we've got
our loans. If you look at kind of the top 25 country exposures that we put out in the third quarter, our loans were
roughly about $15 billion or so. Our total exposure there was roughly about $53 billion. We've seen good growth
in the way of our loan activity there in secured lending. And more broadly we would expect to see,
notwithstanding the environment there, we would expect to see continued client engagement over the course of
2020 and it continues to be an important market for us as we move forward inside of the Asia region.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And in terms of the LIBOR question, obviously we're still a couple of years away. It's hard to know at this
point what that handicap may look like. I would say the industry clearly has been focused on the transition. I would
say a lot of what's been done to-date has been planning for the broader efforts. Clearly, as we've been doing,
we've been making markets in those risk-free rates. We've been issuing off of that index as well such as SOFR.
And so there's a good amount of transition that still needs to take place in terms of execution, including building
liquidity in these risk-free rates. There's a lot of work to be done on contracts as well. It's just hard to know right
now though what the probability of banks continuing to close beyond the end of 2021. I think the industry's focus
has been and will continue to be on ensuring that by the end of 2021 that we are ready to transition away.

In terms of your other question, which was around the significance of the FICO changes, we operate in markets
where FICO is a factor and in markets where it's a less of a factor in terms of how those markets have developed
from a credit rating point of view. FICO, as a result, is one of many factors that we consider when we think about
the lending activity that we do with customers but we tend to focus on the higher-end customers, whether they are
Corporate customers or Consumer customers and how we assess their credit is a combination of things, including
FICO.

Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hey. So, Mike, I know you talked about kind of the efforts that you're undergoing in terms of scoping out contracts
that are in need of re-papering. Can you talk a little bit just about like what you've learned in terms of like the size
of that effort? And then also just kind of do you have like a timeline in mind for kind of completing that work?
And then I know you referred to the kind of updated guidance from IRS (sic) [IFRS] (31:43) and from FASB? Do
you have any kind of timeline in mind for when you expect those proposals to be finalized?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
So in terms of the re-papering efforts, again, this is pretty broad in terms of how we're thinking about that.
Obviously, it's going to pertain more to, I would say, the Corporate loan books, and really that involves a lot of the
centralizing of those contracts, the digitizing of those contracts to enable a smoother transition and whether that's
including amendments or being able to transition to those new rates. So it's going to take some time. I don't have
the exact timeline on it because those contracts which you may want to digitize but then, of course, you may have
more bespoke contracts that we'll be a little more involved. So it's hard to know exactly what that timeline looks
like but clearly, as I've said before, we are operating with the assumption that we transition away from LIBOR by
the end of 2021, so all of our efforts are aimed to get that work done in advance of that date.
And, again, in terms of the broader work going on, again, we're taking that information, we're evaluating it in terms
of what our alternatives may be and making sure that we understand the implications very clearly on us and our
investors. Again, with all these efforts, very clear focus in terms of the timeline that we need to be operating

under. We know what that transition entails, at least in terms of timing. So that just remains a key factor for us; is
that ultimate transition away from LIBOR.

Hi, David.

David Jiang Q
Analyst, PGIM, Inc.
I had a quick question on the issuance plan. I noticed in 2019 and even in 2020, there's no securitization. Is there
not a need for further securitizations out of the Credit Card Trust?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi. It's Mike. I would say that when we've looked at the note program, we've seen very good demand in that
program and, of course, we're evaluating the economics and other factors that impact the notes, including FDIC
fees. So I would say our lead has been with bank notes rather than securitization. But obviously that program is
something that we still could utilize over the course of the year. It's really just been a preference for bank notes
based on the demand and the economics. But we'll be evaluating all of our funding levers over the course of the
year as we normally would.

Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you very much. I just have a couple of more questions for me. I would like to know your expectation
around SEB and how you're factoring that into your plans for prefs and sub debt? So are you expecting SEB to be
finalized for 2020 CCAR? That's the first question. And then your thinking around on how that factors into your
overall plan that you've laid out for prefs [ph] as the less (35:41) sub debt, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so I'll get that started. So look, I mean, just based on the public statements that are out there, we expect
that we will get some version of the SEB prior to the submission for the 2020 CCAR cycle. We'd certainly
welcome the greater clarity. We're obviously between now and then continuing to work on our CCAR process and

as we've done in the past cycles, we'll submit a robust and credible plan based on our bank holding company
scenarios and with obviously consideration for the regulatory scenarios whenever they come in and whenever we
get clarity on SEB, we'll incorporate that accordingly.
I guess what I'd point out is I'd point you back to some extent to our CET1 targeted level, if you will, targeted ratio
of about 11.5%. We're at 11.7% now. And when we think about that target that we've set, we've factored in
obviously the regulatory minimum at about 4.5% – or at 4.5%, another three percentage points for the G-SIB
score that we carry.
And then as a proxy for the stress capital buffer, we have another three percentage points and then obviously a
management buffer of about 100 basis points. And so we factored in based on what we know today and based on
output from prior-year scenarios but as we get more information, we'll obviously move to factor that into our
analysis in time for the submission notwithstanding not having received it yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, and, Hima, it's Mike. I think you were asking about the preferreds and all I would say is that we're really not
taking a different approach. As we've talked about in the past as calls come due, we're going to evaluate the need
for that capital. You could see we're running a little bit above our AT1 target now but again we'll take a view on
what our capital needs are going forward and whether it's an opportunity or not to call that security.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Cavanagh from APG.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Thanks, guys, for putting me back in the queue. So two questions on CECL, we saw a number of your peers put
out varying levels of disclosure on it, how are you guys thinking about that going forward?
And then secondly, for your private label portfolio, how do we think about the RSA agreement and I know they're
all tailored but how should we be thinking about that, the balancing of the provisioning and the varying levels of
flexibility under those contracts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Okay. In terms of CECL, I referenced on the earnings call that we expect the Day 1 impact to increase the
reserves by about 29%, which is in-line with the guidance that I'd given in the past. That roughly equates to about
$4 billion. When we look at that from a regulatory perspective, it's about six basis points on the CET 1 capital in
2020. When you break down that $4 billion, given our Consumer and our Corporate businesses, the lion's share
of it is out of the Consumer business due to cards and that's roughly $4.8 billion is due to cards and you're really
changing the coverage and increasing that from 14 to 23 months.
There's a decrease on the Corporate side of about $800 million and that's due to more precise usage of tenors.
So rounding to the next quarter versus year, as well as incorporating estimated recoveries. And so the
combination of those two get us to that roughly $4 billion. We factor that into how we thought about our go-
forward targets and are comfortable managing to that.

As it relates to disclosure going forward, that's going to – obviously, there are guidelines around the disclosure
and the level of CECL impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the balances that we have and how they
grow through the course of the year. And the mix, whether they are on the card side – Branded Cards versus
Retail Services versus on the Corporate side as well as the economic assumptions that are out there, including
the probability of recession and severity of recession. And so there are a number of factors that will influence kind
of the Day 2 impact, and we obviously will work to ensure that we provide disclosure that is consistent with the
guidelines that have been given.
And then in terms of the second part of your question, the NCLs generally impact the revenue sharing
agreements and not the reserves.

Scott Frost Q
Analyst, State Street Global Advisors
Thanks for the follow. Just to touch on preferreds once again. I just want to make sure I'm getting where your
head is at on, on preferred issuance. I mean understand low rates, tight spreads, and especially what looks like
with five-year [ph] through (41:49) SOFR, very low back end. Is it fair to say that you're thinking of this particular
advantage of new and potential preferreds as more permanent in nature or is that a reach?
And, also, I have a follow-up for your TLAC issuance, just to clarify.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, with the preferreds, I mean typically when you're issuing and you can see what we have outstanding,
they will have some call feature to them, and so we embed that purposely in the structure.
And I'm sorry, your second question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Frost Q
Analyst, State Street Global Advisors
Well, it was – should we think of these as more permanent in nature or is that a reach?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Again, I would say that we've looked at all of our structures. Yeah, there is a call feature. And when that call is
eligible, we'll evaluate the need for maintaining that or not.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Frost A
Analyst, State Street Global Advisors
Okay. Okay. And on TLAC, again, Scott's questions were about rationale for issuance. But what I heard you say
was growth and potential issuance at holdco could be related to balance sheet growth or for resolution purposes.
There's no specificity there. Should we also weave in RoTCE targets as a factor in how you're going to issue?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Well, look, I think when we're issuing; we're again, including a variety of factors. And, first, when we think about
our liability structure, we're focused on maintaining a good amount of liquidity. We want to have the right amount
of liquidity for the firm, we want to have diversification of those liquidity resources. When I think about the
issuance program, we want a broad investor base.
But that being said you heard me talk a lot about optimization of our funding sources. And that optimization is
about both liquidity management, but also ensuring that we're also being smart and economical about those
sources of liquidity. So we certainly do think about the economics and certainly manage the balance sheet in a
way that is facilitating our client needs, but also optimization with a focus on returns, too.
And again, when you look at how we've issued over the past couple of years by broadening out just from dollars
to overseas currencies, again, there's a play there to broaden our investor base, but also looking at the
economics associated with issuing in foreign currency and swapping back to dollars. So a number of factors will
play in, but returns is something, of course, that we are optimizing as well as we think about our funding.

Douglas David Greiner Q
Analyst, Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas Asset Management LLC
Hi. Can you just clarify on the legacy LIBOR structure for the legacy preferreds? Would it be your preference to
exchange or amend that on the capital trust securities?
And secondarily, can you just review like historically the last couple years given where capital levels are, the
strategic rationale for maintaining these capital trust securities? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I think you're talking about the [ph] ends (45:26). And as we've said before, it doesn't make sense at this
time, and I think some time ago we said we'll never say never but at this time that's just not something that we are
looking to pursue.

Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Hey. Good morning, again. Just in terms of the Treasury's plan to issue a 20-year bond, is that an area that you
would like to issue at? And also, if you were to issue a 20-year, would that mean that you would reduce issuance
of the 10-year or reduce issuance at the 30-year part of the curve, or [ph] is it really (46:09) a function of what's on
the other side of the balance sheet? Thank you.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jan-2020
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for that question, again. And when we look at issuance, as we've done in previous
years, we're going to look at a variety of tenors. Ideally, we're not issuing in just a few different tenors, but are
issuing across the curve. That's going to be informed by a desire to keep a good amount of diversification across
the tenors and not have it concentrated in one area. And, again, it's going to be a function of where that investor
demand is, and you saw us start off the year with an 11, non-call 10. That 10-year part of the curve has traded
quite well. There's been good demand there, so that's where we started the year.
In terms of 2020, that is again a tenor point that we will evaluate but again we'll be looking at how good of a
demand we have for that tenor point. But it's hard to know what we would do. I think your question also was, if we
did some 20s, would that take away from 10s? Again, I think we're going to try to issue across a variety of tenors,
but it's hard to know exactly right now what – how far out we will go and then what impact that may have on other
tenors.
