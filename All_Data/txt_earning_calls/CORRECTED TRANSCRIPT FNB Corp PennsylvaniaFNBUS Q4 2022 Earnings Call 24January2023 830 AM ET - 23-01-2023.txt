Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President, and CEO.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. F.N.B. closed strong in 2022, continuing our streak
of outstanding performance and is positioned to capitalize on our momentum as we navigate a complex economic
landscape in 2023. F.N.B.'s fourth quarter operating earnings per share totaled a record $0.44, increasing 13% on
a linked-quarter basis, and bringing the full year operating earnings per share to $1.40. The success of this
quarter was further highlighted by record revenue, continued strong loan growth, disciplined deposit cost
management, and the closing and conversion of the UB Bancorp acquisition in December.
The fourth quarter's exceptional performance is captured in its strong profitability metrics with operating return on
average tangible common equity totaling 22% and the quarterly efficiency ratio below 46%. In the fourth quarter,
total revenue grew 10% linked-quarter to $416 million, with net interest income as the primary driver contributing
13% growth. In addition to benefiting from the Fed rate hikes, our net interest income reflects strong loan growth,
favorable funding costs, and the strategic steps our team has taken with the asset-sensitive position of our
balance sheet.
Net interest margin significantly expanded quarter-over-quarter from 3.19% to 3.53%. Operating expenses were
well-managed, increasing 1.5% linked-quarter. The revenue growth and disciplined expense management
resulted in strong positive operating leverage and an 18% linked-quarter increase in pre-provision net revenue.
F.N.B. ended the year with nearly $44 billion in total assets and $30 billion in loans and leases, a 5% increase
linked-quarter. On an annualized basis, excluding UB Bancorp, period-end commercial and consumer loans grew
14% and 6%, respectively. Continuing a trend we have upheld throughout the entire year, we saw strong loan
growth in markets spanning our full footprint, once again demonstrating the importance of our diverse geographic
coverage and presence in both mature and high-growth markets.
The acquisition of UB Bancorp closed on December 9, 2022 with the system's conversion successfully completed
and integrated. With the addition of UB Bancorp's rich deposit mix, which includes 43% noninterest-bearing
deposits, we ended the year with a total noninterest-bearing deposit mix at 34%. This result was in line with the
end of 2021 despite fed funds increasing 425 basis points, demonstrating the strength of our deposit franchise.
We are pleased with the financial benefits and dedicated employees the UB Bancorp acquisition has brought to
us and expect to generate additional revenue when these customers are introduced to F.N.B.'s more robust
product set. F.N.B.'s impressive fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our significant success driving
value for our clients, communities, employees, and shareholders.
I'd like to call out a few of our many accomplishments. F.N.B. achieved operating earnings per share of $1.40,
one of the highest levels in company history, led by record revenue of $1.4 billion. Total loans grew by $5.3 billion
year-over-year or 21% through strategic combination of footprint-wide organic growth and the completion of two
accretive acquisitions, bringing total assets to $44 billion.
Despite the challenging economic environment, we grew total deposits to an all-time record of $35 billion and
reported average balance growth in all four quarters of 2022, while also maintaining a favorable deposit mix
comprised of 34% noninterest-bearing deposits. We currently hold the top five deposit market share in nearly 50%
of our MSAs, according to data provided by the FDIC. We generated over $1.1 billion of net interest income, up
24% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth, the favorable deposit mix, and the asset-sensitive portion of our

balance sheet. Our team controlled expenses in a high inflationary period, which contributed to F.N.B.'s full-year
efficiency ratio of 52%.
F.N.B. reported total shareholders' equity of $5.7 billion and a CET1 ratio of 9.8%. Our growing capital base
provided our company with unprecedented flexibility even after returning $220 million to shareholders through
common dividends and our active share repurchase program, which has $175 million remaining. Our strong
earnings also resulted in a 40% dividend payout ratio and 34% on an operating basis, providing our company
more internal capital to support for future growth and capital actions.
Credit quality remains solid with consistent and prudent underwriting standards throughout the footprint with total
delinquencies ending the year at 71 basis points, net charge-offs at 6 basis points for the full year, and a reserve
position of 1.33%. We will maintain our steadfast focus on our disciplined credit culture as we continue to navigate
changing economic cycles.
We closed and converted two acquisitions, Howard Bancorp in January and UB Bancorp in December, which
have enhanced our market position in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and North Carolina. Driven by our continued
investment in F.N.B. digital delivery channel and our dedicated mortgage employees, the position's first program
comprised 25% of retail mortgage production in 2022 and grew those high-value households significantly.
We continue to expand our eStore platform, which received over 500,000 interactions in 2022, up 104% year-
over-year, and introduced online applications for multiple consumer loan and small business deposit products.
The success of our digital strategy, we have increased adoption across our expanding customer base, including a
17% increase in online applications.
Our consistent performance does not happen without the right culture and the commitment of exceptional people.
We focus on fostering a positive, productive workplace where engaged employees provide superior service for
our clients and attractive returns for our shareholders. Our success in this regard has led to extensive third-party
recognition.
Since 2011, F.N.B. has received more than 80 prestigious Greenwich Excellence and Best Brand Awards, with 17
in 2022 alone. These results are based on direct feedback from our commercial, middle market, and small
business banking partners. Additionally, F.N.B. received approximately 50 awards as an employer of choice,
including multiple national and regional honors in 2022, earning a place as one of Newsweek's America's Top
(sic) [Greatest] (00:25:07) Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and most recently named to JUST Capital's list of
America's Most JUST Companies for the sixth consecutive year with exceptionally high marks for community
development, employee benefits, and work-life balance.
Our board and leadership team are proud of this year's achievements and we are confident in our company's
continued ability to execute on our strategic plan in 2023. Even in times of economic uncertainty, we are well-
positioned given our diversified loan portfolio, investments in technology, strong liquidity position, capital flexibility,
and strong historical credit performance.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to provide additional detail on our asset quality. Gary?

Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the year with our credit portfolio well-positioned and
our asset quality metrics remaining near historically low levels. Our performance for the period reflects total

delinquency and ended the year at 71 basis points, NPLs and OREO at 39 basis points, weighted asset levels
remaining essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, excluding UB Bancorp, and full-year net charge-offs at 6 basis
points.
I will cover these GAAP asset quality highlights for the quarter and full year in more detail followed by some
insight into our credit strategy we used to manage the loan portfolio throughout economic cycles. And finally, we'll
provide a brief update on the UB Bancorp acquisition that closed during December.
Let's now walk through our credit business. Total delinquency ended December at 71 basis points, reflecting a 12-
basis-point linked-quarter increase, coming off of historically low pass-through levels in the trailing quarters. NPLs
and OREO at 39 basis points were up 7 bps in the quarter with nearly 60% of our NPLs in a contractually current
payment status. Net charge-offs for Q4 totaled $11.9 million or 16 basis points on an annualized basis with full-
year net charge-offs for 2022 totaling $16.2 million stand at a very solid 6 basis points for the year, consistent with
2021 levels also at 6 basis points.
Total provision expense for the quarter stood at $28.5 million that includes $9.4 million of initial provision for non-
PCD loans that were acquired from UB Bancorp, with the remainder providing for loan growth, charge-offs, and
updated economic forecast that reflected a softer macroeconomic environment requiring additional reserve.
Inclusive of the additional day 1 PCD gross-up of $1.8 million, our ending funded reserve stands at $402 million or
a solid 1.33% of loans at year-end, reflecting our strong position relative to our peers with the funded reserve
ticking down 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter. Our NPL coverage position remained strong at 354%.
I'd now like to briefly update you on our recently closed UB Bancorp acquisition and the successful conversion of
this $650 million portfolio during the fourth quarter. Our credit and lending teams continue to diligently review their
loan portfolios as part of our standard post-conversion process following an acquisition. The book remains in line
with our expectations from due diligence with no material impact to our overall credit numbers, loan risk profile, or
our portfolio concentrations at the close of the year.
We'd like to congratulate the team on closing another successful transaction that will bring additional opportunities
to expand our customer base and support our corporate growth objectives in the desirable Carolina markets. We
welcome our new UB Bancorp customers, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide our expansive set of
banking products and services to them as we deepen these relationships.
In closing, we had another successful year marked by the continued strength and favorable positioning of our
credit portfolio moving into 2023, as well as closing two acquisitions to enhance our presence in attractive
markets that will further support our loan growth objectives. Consistent with our proactive and aggressive
approach to managing risk, rating credits and positioning potential problem assets, we continue to closely track
emerging macroeconomic trends and signs of stress heading into a softer environment. We remain steadfast in
our approach to consistent underwriting and managing credit risk to maintain a balanced, well-positioned portfolio
throughout economic cycle.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Now, we'll focus on the fourth quarter financial results and offer guidance
for 2023. Reported fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled $137.5 million or $0.38

per share. After adjusting for $21.9 million of merger-related expenses and $2.8 million of branch consolidation
costs, net income reached record levels of $157 million or $0.44 per share. Full-year 2022 operating earnings per
share also represented one of the company's highest levels, coming in at $1.40.
The growth in the balance sheet brought assets to $44 billion with earning assets of nearly $39 billion at the end
of the year. This was largely driven by the $1.5 billion linked-quarter increase in spot loans and leases, which
included organic growth of $824 million or 11.4% annualized and the $651 million of UB Bancorp acquired loans
as of the December 9 acquisition date.
Spot, C&I, and commercial real estate each grew 6.3% linked-quarter. Consumer loans increased 3.4%, reflecting
portfolio growth and adjustable rate mortgages and the continued success of the Physicians First mortgage
program.
Full-year total loan growth was a robust $5.3 billion or 21.2% on a year-over-year spot basis. Roughly half of this
growth was related to the previously discussed Howard and UB Bancorp acquisitions with the remaining half due
to strong organic growth, capping off three sequential quarters of double-digit organic growth across the footprint.
Average deposits totaled $33.9 billion for the fourth quarter, increasing $301 million or 1%, including UB Bancorp
acquired deposits over last three weeks of the year. When excluding UB Bancorp deposits, average noninterest-
bearing deposits declined only 1% linked-quarter to $11.7 billion. And we maintained a favorable deposit mix at
year-end with 34% noninterest-bearing deposits, demonstrating the strength and granularity of F.N.B.'s deposit
base.
Record quarterly revenue of $415.5 million was driven by record net interest income totaling $334.9 million, a
linked-quarter increase of $37.8 million or 12.7%. The net interest margin increased 34 basis points to 3.53% as
the earning asset yield increased 62 basis points while the cost of funds increased 30 basis points. The largest
driver was the increase in yields on loans and leases, which increased 68 basis points. In fact, the December loan
origination yield was over 6%, the highest since 2009 and approximately 100 basis points higher than the spot
portfolio rate at quarter end.
With 59% of the loan portfolio repricing, we expect the portfolio rates to continue to increase given the December
Federal Reserve rate hike and the expected 25-basis-point increases in February and March. The fourth quarter
also had record positive operating leverage of 29.1%, which we expect to rank in the upper quartile of our peers.
On the other side of the balance sheet, deposit costs continue to be a significant focus for our team. Total
cumulative deposit betas ended the year at 16.3%, below the forecasted 20%, by maintaining the previously
mentioned favorable noninterest-bearing deposit mix and actively managing interest-bearing deposit costs.
We were able to keep the average interest-bearing deposit cost below 1% for the fourth quarter, again,
demonstrating the strength of our customer relationships. We have been able to effectively manage deposit costs,
strategic pricing campaigns supported by our data analytics platform. While competitive pressures on deposit
pricing continue to rise, we are forecasting a cumulative total deposit beta to be in the low-20s at the end of the
first quarter of 2023.
Turning to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income totaled $80.6 million, a decrease of $1.9 million
or 2.2% compared to the prior quarter. Mortgage banking operations income decreased $2.4 million with a decline
in mortgages sold in the secondary market and lower gain on sale margins. Insurance commissions and fees
decreased $1.3 million, reflecting seasonality in the fourth quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
Capital markets income totaled $10 million with this strong level supported by an increase in syndications and
solid contributions from swap fees and international banking. On a full-year basis, noninterest income totaled
$323.6 million, a 2.1% decrease from 2021, primarily reflecting the significantly lower mortgage banking
operations income, which was partially offset by several other fee-based businesses, again, demonstrating the
importance of our diversified business strategy.
On an operating basis, noninterest expense totaled $195.8 million, a 1.5% increase from the third quarter and an
increase of 8.3% from the year-ago quarter, which is primarily driven by the acquired Howard and Union expense
basis in occupancy and equipment and outside services.
Other noninterest expense increased linked-quarter, primarily from charitable contributions during the quarter that
qualified for Pennsylvania bank shares tax credits. Salaries and employee benefits decreased in the third quarter
due to lower medical costs and seasonally lower production of performance-related incentives. Excluding
significant items totaling $52.3 million in 2022 and $4.4 million in 2021, full year operating noninterest expense
increased $45.4 million or 6.2%.
Fourth quarter's operating pre-provision net revenue totaled a record $219 million, representing an 81% increase
from the year-ago quarter. On a full year basis, operating pre-provision net revenue was $669.2 million, an
increase of 31.7% in 2021.
Our capital ratios ended the year at levels that are expected to be at or above pure median. Tangible book value
per common share was $8.27 at December 31, an increase of $0.25 per share from September 30, largely from
the higher level of earnings and the decreased impact of AOCI by $0.09 per share. CET1 ended the year at a
solid 9.8% and the TCE ratio totaled 7.24%.
Let's now look at the 2023 financial objectives starting with the balance sheet. We expect loans to increase mid
single digits on a year-over-year spot basis. Total deposits are projected to end 2023 at a similar level as the
December 31, 2020 spot balances as customer growth continues alongside active management of deposit rates
in an environment with rising deposit betas.
Full year net interest income is expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.4 billion with the first quarter of 2023
between $335 million and $345 million. Our guidance currently assumes 25 basis point rate increases in both
February and March, with no additional rate actions projected for the remainder of the year. Full year noninterest
income is expected to be between $300 million to $320 million with the first quarter in the mid $70 million range.
Full-year guidance for noninterest expense on an operating basis is $830 million and $850 million, which assumes
an additional $8 million in FDIC deposit insurance costs, reflecting higher assessment rates that may remain in
effect to the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio which the FDIC's long term goal of 2%.
This expense guidance range implies growth of 7% to 10% on full-year 2022 operating expense figures. At the
midpoint of our guidance, the efficiency ratio would be below 50% for full year 2023. When excluding the FDIC
increase and the Union acquired expense base, the 2023 expense range would be 4% to 7% on a year-over-year
basis.
The first quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between $210 million to $215 million as the compensation
expense is higher in the first quarter, largely due to normal seasonal long-term stock compensation and higher
7

payroll taxes at the start of a new year. Full-year provision guidance is $65 million to $85 million and is dependent
on net loan growth and CECL model-related builds from a softer macroeconomic environment.
Lastly, the effective tax rate should be between 20% and 21% for the full year, which does not assume any
investment tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. As we start the New Year, we remain focused on executing our strategy and serving our
stakeholders. We will do this by staying true to our values-based culture and delivering on the financial guidance
Vince provided, with a focus on generating positive operating leverage and efficiently deploying capital in the most
effective way to optimize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Before we close today, I want to recognize our dedicated team who made our performance possible. Every
employee contributes to the success of the company, and I strongly believe that we will continue to win in F.N.B.
because of our outstanding employees and the excellent culture we have developed together.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] And our first question today comes from Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Just curious...
[indiscernible] (00:26:56)
You guys talked in the release a little bit about where you saw the strongest growth geographically. And just
curious if you can give a little more color there, specifically on the – what percentage of the commercial growth
you're seeing coming out of the Carolina footprint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't know that we have the specifics in our fingertips, but I can tell you just from what [indiscernible] (00:27:23)
we get. The Carolinas had an exceptional year. They contributed throughout the year in Raleigh, Charlotte, the
Piedmont Triad. All of those areas were big contributors to loan growth. They all exceeded their planned
objectives for the year and had a tremendous year in cross-selling. So, in addition to originating loans, they are
also able to cross-sell capital markets products, trust, and investment products, and insurance throughout that
footprint.

So, they were a significant driver. Pittsburgh has always been a solid market for us given our market share here.
The groups in Pittsburgh [ph] will be key for us (00:28:10) this year. And I also want to include our expansion
market in Charleston. The team down there has done an exceptional job over the last two years [indiscernible]
(00:28:22) the last two years.
So, those areas have been huge contributors. In the past, the mid-Atlantic region had been a fairly substantial
contributor, but we were able to, through various take-outs, reduce the size of the CRE portfolio in that market.
So, they had a little bit more of a headwind coming into the year.
And I will tell you that as we move into next year, the pipelines have softened a little bit kind of globally, but we
had two consecutive quarters of pretty solid growth. So, we're down about 15% year-over-year [ph] through
(00:29:05) the pipeline, which is typically a seasonal low point. And we're being a little more careful as we move
into next year. There's quite a bit of economic uncertainty, and we'll play it on the conservative side.
So, very excited about where we sit there, Frank, in terms of originations because it was fairly geographically
spread out. We got some assistance from the Midwest and the Northeast with – and some of the slower growth
markets because they have a heavier industrial base and there seemed to be a little more activity there to offset
some of the declines in [indiscernible] (00:29:47) opportunities in the mid-Atlantic region. So, it all kind of
balanced out. And I think as we've said all along, that has been our strategy, to have a very balanced [ph]
approach (00:29:56) to grow.

Thanks for all the color. And then, just wanted to follow up on the guide, specifically on fee income. It seems like –
I don't know. Even if I can sort of normalize the other line item this quarter maybe and get things to mid-70s
number, you're still sort of at – already at sort of the midpoint of that run rate guide for next year. And so just kind
of curious if you can provide any puts and takes in terms of where you might see some growth in fees and where
we could see some further weakness in 2023.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I could comment, Frank. Just, I guess, high level, noninterest income was solid again at $80.6 million for the
quarter, down slightly from the third quarter. Mortgage banking income coming down $2.4 million, which is kind of
normal seasonality there.
One thing I did want to point out, too, is that it's important that the growth in the balance sheet of adjustable rate
mortgages has been higher with the portfolio and more loans that we might otherwise have been selling in the
past. So, the fee revenue is a little bit lower on the mortgage banking side. Now, capital markets for the quarter
were very solid at $10 million. We had higher contribution compared to the third quarter, partially offsetting that
reduced contribution from mortgage and second consecutive quarter with strong syndication fees.
As you look ahead, some of that revenue sources are lumpy, right? The syndication fees are always consistently
at the same level. They kind of come in lumpy. The swap fees also can be a little bit lumpy. So, us guiding to mid-
70s again, which is what we guided to for the fourth quarter, is really just kind of a function of that. As well as we
made some changes to consumer deposit fees we had announced in November. So, that's also kind of rolling
through the number. So, it's kind of a conservative look, I would say, based on kind of what we know today. But
the lumpiness, you can't predict with certainty as far as some of the kind of capital markets components. So, that's
why we guide at that kind of mid-70s level.
[ph] Thanks, Frank (00:32:13).

South Carolina, produced roughly 40% of our net loan growth.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. No. I appreciate that. Then if I could just lastly, just you're getting closer and closer to that 10% CET1 ratio.
And just wondering if any sort of strategic changes we can expect when you do reach that level and pass through
it. And I guess specifically wondering about additional capital return that this could trigger greater buyback activity
as we go – as we move through 2023.Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just say, we expect to build the 10% in the near term here, given the [ph] amount (00:33:06) of
earnings that we've been generating, really creating that capital flexibility we've never had in the past. So,
10

regarding buybacks, I mean, our first and best use of capital, as we've said all along, strategy is the same, is to
deploy it into loan growth. So, depending on how strong the loan growth is or how much it slows down, we'll have
more opportunity to do buyback.
So, it's clearly on the table for 2023. As you know, we remain committed to managing capital in a way that just
fully optimize shareholder value, fully aligned with shareholder interest. So, we will be looking at that. We'll be
opportunistic as we go through the year. I think in total, we have about $175 million or so of capacity remaining
within our former programs. So, clearly, as we expect to build past that 10% level, the share buybacks were
definitely something we'll be pursuing and evaluating on a daily basis.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Maybe starting with Vince, your comments on utilizing analytics to help drive the deposit base. Can you
give us some examples of how you're doing that? I mean, your deposit performance has been really strong. Your
beta, among the best in the group so far. I guess, how are you getting that? And is that going to be a sustainable
level – or a sustainable avenue of growth as we go forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. This is Vince Delie, actually. Vince, he mentioned that in his comments. And I will tell you, we've made a
significant investment in our ability to analyze large quantities of data. We've talked about that before. We even
got – we have an entire team that manages governments and the systems. We've invested early and heavily in
that area over the last five or six years.
We use that team to basically give us a better understanding of the types of clients that we have and to really drill
into client behavior, expectation, and it enables us to be able to provide them with better solutions. And the
answer on the deposit stability and growth, I think we're an outstanding deposit franchise. I think if you look at the
mix, the mix is very strong relative to the peers. The stability of the demand deposit base is very strong. The
granularity is strong. So, there's quite a bit that goes into managing a deposit portfolio that size. There's not just
one silver bullet. So, we focus – we use analytics to focus on treasury management opportunities within our
11

customer base. We use the analytics to view customers that are single-source or single-product customers that
may have a loan product, but don't have a fuller depository relationship with us.
We use the analytics tool to tier the clients based upon need, and that helps us direct our resources more
effectively to drive growth. We also use the analytics tool with our digital offering so that we can present products
and services to clients as they engage the eStore online. And I mentioned in my comments, we had 500,000
views on the website and on the mobile app because our eStore is embedded into our mobile application. So, it's
right there for the customers to engage with.
That – all of that helps us manage the betas and the deposit outflows and deposit growth and the mix of the
deposit. So, it's a pretty complex set of strategies that we deploy and the tactics that underlie the strategy in each
segment really are geared towards driving better performance in that deposit portfolio. Hopefully, that answers
your question. That's pretty flawed, but...

... [indiscernible] (00:37:26) goes on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That was great color. Maybe looking at margin, you project – or you expect [ph] a couple more (00:37:39) 25-
basis-point hikes. What's your expectation for DDA diminishment in that scenario? And are you taking any steps
to protect margin if we start shifting to more of an expectation for lower rates in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would start with just the noninterest-bearing deposits again were a big focus in the company. So, our
ability – as you can see here in my prepared remarks, I mean, DDAs were down 1% or so the last – for the
quarter. That takes a lot of effort. All the pools that Vince talked about analytically, as well as our team on the front
line and our relationships with customers that are very strong, we've created a lot of goodwill going to PPP during
that process with existing customers and new customers that we've been broadening relationships with. So, that –
those relationships and our customers' willingness to talk to us and if they're looking to move money instead of
just moving money is very valuable. And our team on the front line has been very active throughout the fourth
quarter talking to customers. We have a large corporate initiative. That's been on the lending side, as well as the
deposit side and just been bearing fruit during the quarter.
So, our goal is to sustain the DDAs and to grow them here. We have a slide in there that shows the percent of
[ph] core (00:39:03) deposits from 16% up to 34%. Our team is incented to work hard to grow those noninterest-
bearing deposits.

We have a lot of tools in place, but why don't you mention also our active asset/liability strategy focused on
preserving margin spread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, we – as you would expect, I mean, our treasury team studies it daily. I mean, we've been
looking at hedging opportunities really for the last year and we did some small amounts from hedging probably six
months or so ago, but decided not to put more on because of where levels were and what was expected to
happen with rates. You don't have to go back that far when everybody was locked in that rates are just going to
fall off a cliff one quarter or two quarters into the year and then bring a [indiscernible] (00:39:51) protection. And
that became very expensive. So, we put some on.
Our – naturally, our asset sensitivity has been kind of approaching neutral if you look at the asset-sensitive
interest rate risk position. You're down to like 1% or so for plus-100, minus-100. So, organically, it's been kind of
coming down as we've been deploying cash. It's just kind of the natural movement of the balance sheet.
So, we'll continue to monitor, Jared. But at this point, the price points haven't made sense to us to load up on
hedges for the balance sheet. But we'll continue to look at it and we'll be smart about it when it makes sense. And
if it does make sense to us, we'll put [ph] something out (00:40:33). We've done about $1 billion or so of receive-
fixed swaps over the [ph] recent (00:40:38) period. So, we have that component there. But the natural asset
sensitivity coming down, and as you know, our net interest income is at a much higher base. So, it's kind of
coming off of that. So, having that lower interest rate risk – or more neutral interest rate risk position is a positive
and [indiscernible] (00:40:58) to move forward.
So, we continue to monitor as we have and evaluate any hedging opportunities that make sense. But the main
deposits are always valuable, and in this environment even more valuable. So, our team's success in growing
those [ph] noninterest-bearing (00:41:11) deposits, which is key for us, that will always be a focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. [ph] Just follow-up (00:41:17) for me, just on the capital management side, what's the appetite for
M&A here? And maybe, Vince, what's your view of sort of the current state of bank mergers overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think I wouldn't want to be an investment banker in the short run here. I think it's been a pretty challenging
environment. I – investment banking fees, like, in general, were down 40%. Given what's happened with AOCI in
investment level, it becomes very challenging to do a deal that's accretive that doesn't have substantial
[indiscernible] (00:41:54) elements to it. And we've stated repeatedly that we're not interested in diluting tangible
book value. We have – as Vince said, we have capital flexibility that we've never had before, which could mean a
number of things. I mean, we could become more aggressive in buying shares back at loan growth, as well as
[indiscernible] (00:42:16).
If you look at the dividend payout ratio on an operating basis, we're down to 34%, unheard of. I mean, when we
took the reins here, Vince and I, we were like 80% – 70% to 80% payout ratio. So, we have incredible flexibility
moving forward. We want to make sure it benefits our shareholders. So, our focus is just driving shareholder

returns and making sure that we're making smart decisions with capital so that we can move the stock price up
and repatriate appropriate levels of capital [ph] at some point (00:42:51). That's the strategy moving forward.

Jared, just to go back on the interest rate risk, on slide 11, we did have a chart there that shows the interest risk
sensitivity over time, and you can see kind of how it's moved down. We have a plus-200, plus-100 [ph] sharp gain
(00:43:10). You can see how it organically has come down [ph] closer to deal flow (00:43:10) by the end of the
year. Point that out, too.

Hey, Casey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I have a question on the funding strategy. So, the guide outlines about $1.5 billion of loan growth with deposits
flat. I just want to understand what's the outlook for funding that loan growth, be it bond book or borrowings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We still have some excess cash, Casey, to put to work. So, we'll deploy that as we go through the year. I
think if you look at the loan-to-deposit ratio, what's in our guidance and kind of in our plan, we get down to maybe
– or up to 90%, 91% by the end of the year, which is still a very comfortable level for us. So, the combination of
deploying the cash – and we might have some small level of borrowings as we get towards the end of the year,
but overall, loan-to-deposit ratio, very comfortable at those levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Well, I mean, in the past, I remember when we got up to about 97%, we started to get uncomfortable. And we
took some actions at that point, some promotional CD programs and those types of things to kind of bring it down.
So, I think that's the level, but our prior history, that was when we decided to start doing them. So, I think if you
got up to 95-ish, 97%, then we would look at other options or strategies we should deploy at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have many tools at our disposal, Casey, to drive deposit growth. The question is, how much margin you want
to give up [indiscernible] (00:45:13).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And to – Casey, just to clarify, Casey, too – I don't have a figure in front of me. So, there's $1.2 billion if you look
at our balance sheet at the end of the year of noninterest-bearing deposits. So, that cash being deployed to
support the loan growth would be the first place you would go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. Understood. Okay. And then, apologies if I missed it, any update – the cum beta is coming in, very nice
surprise, positively versus what you were expecting this year. Any updated thoughts on where cum beta ends up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In my prepared remarks, Casey, I mentioned kind of low-20s at the end of the third quarter. And if we look
at kind of overall, I would say, well, a few comments on betas, right? I think our team has done an admirable job
in the field, strategically managing interest-bearing deposits for us while we're building noninterest-bearing. It's a
lot of effort, as you would expect. It's daily effort talking to customers, managing the relationships, being smart
about raising rates for customers that have kind of full relationships. So, it's been a very active process. It will
continue to be an active process for us.
We ended the year, as you saw on the slide, at 16.3%, getting down into the low-20s by the end of the third
quarter. And then if you look at kind of the midpoint of our guidance, by the end of the year, kind of cumulative
total beta would be in the high-20s is what we're kind of projecting as we sit here today versus about 24% in the
last [ph] hiking (00:46:50) cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got you. Apologies, I missed that. So, high-20s through the cycle is what you're thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
At the end of the year. Yeah. [ph] It's pretty – kind of through 20s (00:47:01).

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. Just last one for me, maybe one for Gary. So, the provision guide of $65 million to $85 million, you
guys do mention a softer macroeconomic environment. We're all kind of struggling with CECL modeling. Just
wondering if any color in – you can provide on what – how softer that macro is, be it unemployment rates, GDP, et
cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It's pretty much across the board, Casey. And during the quarter, we also saw some softer economic
forecasting in our CECL models which impacted the provision to the tune of about $8 million. So, we've got that
built in through 2023. So, that is a pretty good portion of where we've guided to across the year.
The other naturally is – the other naturally is loan growth as far as the [indiscernible] (00:48:18) there. And loan
growth will move those numbers a little bit within that range, as we've talked in the past.

Okay. Okay. I apologize. All right. Terrific. Do you have a thought on kind of how much reserve build is in the
guidance relative to what would be just loan growth or charge-off activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. CECL impact is about a third, loan growth is about half of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then maybe we could just talk a little bit more about the margin. I know we talked
a lot about deposit betas, but just interested in your thoughts on actually the pace of the margin. We can kind of
back into what the rest of the – what the 2023 would look like based on your guidance. But just interested in terms
of if you do continue to get expansion in the first quarter and kind of how much – how accelerated the contraction
you're expecting after that point would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I can comment on that, Danny. The outlook, just to restate again, includes an additional 50 basis points of
hikes in February and March with no additional Fed actions for the rest of the year. Our guidance would imply a
slight increase in margin from the 3.53% level that we were at in the fourth quarter, peaking into the second
quarter based on what's in our plan. But we're talking single digits of basis point movements there. So, there's still
some upside to that level. And then similarly on the other side, comes down a little bit from that [ph] CECL
(00:50:57), but we're talking in the single basis point type level. So, that was [ph] baked into that (00:51:01).

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Terrific. And then I just wanted to, again, clarify an earlier comment. I think you said the midpoint of your
expense guidance would assume that you are – would be under 50% efficiency ratio in 2023. I just want to make
sure that that's what I heard. And if there was kind of a – I had an original question. Like, how likely you think it is
that you do stay under 50%? But I guess assuming your expenses come in about where you expect – you would
expect that to be under 50% is an accurate statement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Using the midpoint of our guidance kind of across all the different categories, that's – you're very right.
That's an accurate statement.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And is that kind of becoming a longer term goal for the bank to stay under 50% efficiency ratio or – and if
we get into a lower rate environment, you think that might drift back over?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say our goal would be to continue to reinvest in the company. And with the changes in the margin based
upon macroeconomic factors, it could swing back and forth over 50%, under 50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Low-50s, I would say, would be a reasonable longer term kind of low to mid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But I will tell you that there will be capital investment required as we move forward, particularly in technology, for
us to stay competitive, for us to maintain margins in the future, and to keep doing what we're doing with the betas.
And it's not a [ph] free pass (00:52:45) forever. So, we have to keep watching what we do and we're going to have
to manage the margin. As you know, we're in a very good period with our organization. We've been part – for this
time, we're benefiting. But obviously, the world is going to change so we're [ph] building on expense inflow
(00:53:04) and we continue to reinvest in the company.
Sorry, I didn't [ph] know (00:53:10)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. No. No. That's great. I would just add to that. I did mention the kind of cost savings target for 2023, which is
$9 million. As you know, we're a [ph] disciplined (00:53:20) manager of expenses. We continue to invest, as Vince
said, in a variety of initiatives on the digital side and de novos and some of our kind of digital infrastructure.
And then one thing I would add, in the past, I've talked about kind of project improvement – process improvement,
I should say. We've always had a focus on that, renegotiating with vendors, facilities, space optimization. But the
process improvement side of it, we've recently reorganized a little bit internally, adding some additional resources
to drive this corporate-wide focus on process improvement.
I think there's a lot of opportunities deploying RPA-type technology to really drive further efficiency as we go
forward. And we're still in the early stages of that, but that also will contribute, yeah, I think, allowing us to have
sustainably in the low 50s as you move forward given all those efforts.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah. Obviously, you guys covered most of it. Just a couple
quick ones to wrap this up here. Just, Vince, in terms of the kind of geographic footprint, you mentioned a little bit
about some pipeline and some stuff from, like, the Carolinas, et cetera. But just as we look at kind of the spread of
the bank today, any opportunities or areas of focus for you guys in 2023 that we should be mindful of, maybe
something like Philadelphia where there's been a lot of mid-caps taken out over the last couple years. Just
anything kind of like that that you got that's on your radar that you would convey to us at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, I will tell you this. We have studied Philadelphia from a commercial lending perspective. We do
have an office there. Our plan is to continue to expand it. We think there's some opportunity there in the middle
market, large corporate space.
I also think – Philadelphia, when we ran our model, when we looked at MSAs, because of the number of
companies domiciled there and the competitive climate, it scored out pretty high. The dynamic keeps changing.
There are fewer competitors, right? So, we're seeing it as an opportunistic area to expand.
And there are several other markets that we launched into that we'll continue to bolt onto. We've had tremendous
success in Charleston. Our plan is to continue to grow there. We are looking at de novo expansion in Richmond.
We've studied opening a loan production office commercial-only in Atlanta. And those are pretty much the areas
that we're focusing on, but nothing earth-shattering or there's no [indiscernible] (00:56:16) retail de novo
expansion. But I think there are opportunities for us to extract additional high-quality growth in our existing
footprint where we may not have the density.
And then the other thing that we've done strategically was to substantially increase our ATM rollout. What we
found is that that's helped us immensely with the retention of customers growing [indiscernible] (00:56:44),
expanding small business opportunity. So, we've done that through both branding opportunities and direct
placement of ATMs and ITMs. So, our ATM network grew more than 30% across our footprint. So, we have 1,200
ATM locations. So, 250 of those were rolled out in North and South Carolina; and then another 250 in Maryland,
Virginia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. – Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C.
So, we're trying to supplement our physical delivery channel in the form of branches with other channels to
distribute cash. And then we're marketing our eStore, which enables individuals and small businesses to open
accounts online.
Anyway, that's the strategy. And I think from a geographic perspective, there's plenty of opportunity within our
existing footprint for us to continue to grow.

Yeah. I mean, that makes sense. So, from the outside looking in, it would seem like, especially around the 95
corridor, like Virginia, like you mentioned, Philadelphia, like, they're – a lot of the competitors there, they were
much more loaned up, right? Probably a lot less willingness to lend. Deposit betas are a lot higher. The balance
sheets are a lot smaller. It would seem like you guys have a pretty attractive value proposition for some lending
talent in those markets, coming from the West and South as opposed to coming from the New York area where
there's just more balance sheet constraints.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And I think our treasury management offering, at least as it scores out through Greenwich and other
surveys is pretty well-respected. So, that enables us to go in and garner deposits as well. We go in. We become
the principal banks. We get the operating accounts. We cross-sell treasury management services. And I think
we've proven moving into the Southeast that our products stand out pretty well. If you look at the noninterest
income growth of the company, a lot of that was driven from our expansion into the Southeast. And there was
quite a bit of skepticism about our ability to compete. I think we've put that to rest. And if you look at the growth in
various categories, it's been fairly substantial and it's been very robust. So, we have the product capability as well
to go into some of the markets that we don't have density in within our existing seven-state footprint.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that, Vince. And then just last for me, just on the effective tax rate guide, it says, assumes no
investment tax credit activity. Can you just remind us quickly what the activity looked like last year? And just also
if you do move forward with any transactions there, what you guys typically look at from an opportunity
standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[ph] Yes. So, Vince C. (00:59:38) answer. Go ahead, Vince.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just say, I mean, it's a line of business for us. We don't have some transactions each year. I mean,
in 2022, I don't think we had – we had one in 2022. We had maybe a couple in 2021. So, I mean, there's an active
business process there. And we may have some this year, we just don't want to put it in the guidance. If we do,
then it's a positive additive to the guidance there. So...

...typically solar. They have a long [indiscernible] (01:00:17) period. So, there's a long – it takes a lot of time to get
to the finish line. So, there's some supply chain issues with the solar panels, so that's elongated some of those

Brian Joseph Martin Q

[ph] Thanks for (01:00:45) taking the questions. Just one clarification. I think it was Vince. Vince, you've
mentioned the pipelines. Just, can you – I guess was it 15%? I'm not sure if you were speaking more to the
commercial, the consumer. Just give us an update on what those pipelines – I know they're a little bit softer, but
just connecting the dots there, just whether it was commercial or consumer, just kind of how they're trending here.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And what I said, we had two very strong quarters in terms of production that tends to – you have to reset. We're
moving into a slower seasonal period. So, our pipelines are down. And even given all of that, when you look at it
on a comparable basis taking seasonality out of it, we're still down 10% to 15%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And they're rebuilding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And they're rebuilding the pipelines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's just something that [indiscernible] (01:01:49) illustrates where we are economically. I think there's a lot of
uncertainty. I think our borrowers are on the sidelines for a little bit here to see what happens, right? And it's going
to be a little while until we start to see that build back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Then the consumer...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[ph] That's probably (01:02:09)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Into second quarter. And then on the consumer side, how is that trending today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Consumer pipeline, there's seasonality there as well. So, it's kind of tough to say. I think the pipelines in
general have been pretty consistent where they've been seasonally, maybe down a little bit. Mortgage, there's
more production coming on line in terms of opportunities for us to take on adjustable rate mortgages on our
balance sheet. So, we're seeing growth in that category.

Direct consumer, we're seeing a little bit of slowness in the [indiscernible] (01:03:00) space now. But that tends to
build back up again as we move through the normal housing sales season, home improvement season starts to
pick up here at the end of March. So, it's a little tough to tell.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Small business is up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Small business is up, pretty much across the board. I mean, we have some good momentum in the number of
markets that we've entered. We have a fairly sizable portfolio [indiscernible] (01:03:26) with the total bank. It's not
– it's over $1 billion, but relative [indiscernible] (01:03:34) commercial portfolio is much identical. We're seeing
some really good positive momentum in the Carolinas, in the mid-Atlantic group, and the [ph] Middle East
(01:03:42). So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. No. Thanks for the color. And maybe just one or two others. Just on the – inside the guide on the fee
income side, just kind of your thoughts on mortgage, obviously being kind of a low point for the year and [ph] kind
of (01:03:59) – just trying to – as you think about next year, I guess, can you give any thoughts, just on high level,
on how you're viewing the mortgage activity, given kind of what we saw throughout the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think I'm going to turn this over to Vince in a minute, but I think [ph] on the phase of (01:04:16)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Basically, the mortgage business, we've always on a track globally what the expectations are from a number of
statistical sources that tell us where growth is expected to be. We tend do a little better – not a little better. We do
a lot better than what the typical forecasts are. So, I attribute that to the geographic dispersion of our originators.
We've had great success in certain segments as well. Physicians – the Physicians program that we had. That
portfolio has now grown substantially. It was over $1 billion. So, there's little pockets that we go after. But there's
also certain markets that tend to have better housing markets generally than our legacy markets like the Carolinas
and the mid-Atlantic region where we have originators dispersed.
I think we'll probably outperform the market overall again this year. I would expect that. I think that the servicing
portfolio that we have has been a good hedge for us from an earnings perspective.

Within the quarter, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, that's helped us. But – go ahead, Vince. You've got a couple of other [ph] factors (01:05:33).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I was just going to add that, look at production overall from the fourth quarter, $567 million. Seasonally
down from third quarter, but it's now 16%. So, it fell off a cliff. And then to Vince's point, I mean, the high-level
industry forecast right now is for production originations to be down 24%. Baked into our expectations and our
guidance, it's more like a down kind of 14%. So, we would expect to outperform the industry like Vince said. And
we have done that in the past, and we'll continue to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. So, a little bit lower. [ph] Honestly, you target (01:06:12) 14% year-over-year is kind of what you're
looking at there, right, Vince?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Full year to full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Perfect. And then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And just one more thing. I mean, we have – with the lowering of the 10-year interest rate, we have seen a pickup
in lockup volume in both mortgage and in the consumable. Just saying that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. No. That makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[ph] Brains do have a (01:06:39)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Yes. And just to remind me, I guess on the deposits, there's been a lot of talk about the beta. What did you
guys exit the quarter on the cost-to-deposits? I guess I know you talked about the betas, where they trend to. But
for, like, the month of December, where were the – I think you said loan yields were – I thought they're 6% for the
quarter, the origination yields, but the cost of deposits as far as exiting in December, where were you guys there?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Total deposit costs ended December at 79 basis points and interest-bearing deposits ended the year at
about 1.14%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Perfect. Then last one for me was just on the deposits. You guys talked about the guide being
relatively flat. Just the mix, I mean, I know you talked about the work it takes to keep the deposits where they are.
Just where you are now on the DD&A. As you kind of look throughout the year, I mean, do you expect that
number to come down a bit? Is that kind of in your forecast? Or I guess, do you think the efforts you guys have
can – you can kind of maintain this level you've reset to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're going to work hard to maintain and grow that source of funding for us, honestly. I mean, there's been some
mix shift into CDs, as you would expect, particularly in the municipal and commercial side. I mean, there's been
some shifting into CD. The key is that it's still kind of staying in the house, so it's moving around a little bit. And the
noninterest-bearing deposits, like I said earlier, it's a big focus in the company with existing clients, but also
bringing in new clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. But you – really, we have to see how things play out throughout the year. I mean, there's going to be
pressure on noninterest-bearing deposits with [ph] this intermediation (01:08:24) within the existing book as we
move into a period of extended high rates, Brian. So, we're going to have to work really hard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But I think we've outperformed, at least what we've seen reported recently. And we're going to keep doing what
we're doing to maintain those balances to the best of our ability because that really drives our profitability through
the next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
And you're in a much higher base now with all the efforts you guys have had here over the last year or two with
the money taken [indiscernible] (01:08:55)...

Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Hey. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but could you just give me a reset on the
Physicians First portfolio? You said it's about just over $1 billion, [ph] caught up (01:09:30) in year-over-year
growth. What are like new loans coming in on? Any kind of extra color there would be great.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have dedicated team that originates mortgage loans in the space. They've done a terrific job. We built out on
our eStore platform, a digitized product offering. It bundles a set of products from physicians. So, that's been
offered electronically on the eStore, and we use that, the eStore to promote the product digitally. And we've done
very, very well. I mean, I can tell you, the CAGR on this portfolio is fairly significant, 65% since we started in [ph]
2018 (01:10:21). So, it's grown nicely.
We started with originators first, and then we supplemented their effort with the digital offering and set up a
campaign. If you just look at households with physicians, we're up 66% in Eastern North Carolina and mid-Atlantic
region alone. So, we've had some good success in those markets. I – the full year production was over $0.5
billion. So, it's been – the portfolio stands at $1.2 billion at year-end. So, the program has worked very well for us.
And those are high-value households in that we feel confident that with our digital capabilities and our analytics,
we'll be able to continue to penetrate that household with additional products and services. So, it's a good
program for us. The credit quality is stellar in that portfolio. So...
