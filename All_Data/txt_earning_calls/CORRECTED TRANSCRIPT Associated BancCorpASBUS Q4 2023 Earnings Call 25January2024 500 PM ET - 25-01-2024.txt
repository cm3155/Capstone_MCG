Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening. And I'm
joined here once again by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. I'd
like to start by sharing some highlights for the fourth quarter and then 2023 as a whole. From there, Derek's going
to send an update on margin, income statement, and capital trends; and then Pat will provide an update on credit
quality.
Now, it's safe to say that 2023 was an extraordinary year for regional banks. From rapid interest rate hikes to
credit concerns to all our bank failures, the industry is forced to grapple with new challenges that created
uncertainty in the first half of the year. Here at Associated, we weren't immune to the volatility that impacted the
regional banking group as a whole, but we weathered the storm through decisive actions that bolstered our
liquidity and communication that was transparent with our customers.
Importantly, we also remained forward-looking. This enabled us to pivot quickly and maintain momentum with our
strategic plan. Over the course of the year, we reached several important milestones on our Phase 1 initiatives.
We reached nearly $700 million in combined balances in our asset-based lending and equipment finance
verticals.
We surpassed $2 billion in outstandings in our prime/super-prime auto book and expanded the business within
our home footprint. We launched a new brand campaign, made several product enhancements and sharpened
our digital sales capabilities, driving a 19% increase in consumer checking household acquisition and a 7%
decrease in attrition.
We continue to punch above our weight in digital, launching 11 major platform upgrades and achieving a three-
year high in consumer digital customer satisfaction scores. We maintained strong momentum in mass affluent,
where we added over $730 million in net new deposits since launch at the end of 2022. And all these efforts
helped us grow our core customer base by over 3% in the back half of 2023, with growth in both our consumer
and our commercial segments.
To further build on this momentum, we announced a multifaceted second phase of our strategic plan in
November, addressing expense control, organic growth and balance sheet repositioning simultaneously. The
expense cuts and repositioning were completed in the fourth quarter. Multiple leadership positions have already
been filled with top industry talent, and RM hiring is ahead of schedule. Simply put, we are on track.
Now, as we look at forward macro questions that remain with regards to the economy and credit and geopolitical
landscape, closer to home, however, we're confident in our markets, where unemployment rates in Wisconsin,
Minnesota and several other Midwestern states remain below the national average of 3.7%.
We're confident in our Associated Bank team, who have consistently proven that they can drive best-in-class
service, while continuing to bring new ideas to life. And we're confident in our plan that promotes growth and
diversification to enhance our profitability without abandoning our foundational discipline on credit and expense
management. With all these factors coming together at once, we are well positioned to deliver enhanced value to
all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.
With that, I'd like to walk through some highlights from the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2023, starting on
page 2 â€“ slide 2. On a GAAP basis, our fourth quarter results were impacted by onetime items tied to the balance
sheet repositioning we announced back in November and the FDIC special assessment that was finalized during

the quarter. After excluding these onetime items, momentum of our core business was reflected through adjusted
earnings per share of $0.53.
During the quarter, we continued to transform our balance sheet by executing on initiatives that helped us lower
our funding costs and improve our liquidity position, while improving earning asset yields. On the funding side, our
focus remains squarely on growing core customer deposits. After growing these core customer deposits by 2% in
Q3, we add an additional 1% growth in Q4, with growth once again coming from both the consumer and
commercial sides of the business.
All in all, we grew core customer deposits by over $800 million in the back half of the year as we continue to
realize the impacts of our customer acquisition and relationship-deepening initiatives. We also added brokered
CDs during the quarter as a way to replace FHLB advances. These actions and business results led to an overall
decrease in our wholesale funding of 9%.
Within our loan portfolio, our fourth quarter results were skewed by the $969 million in mortgage loans we sold
toward the end of the quarter. But on an adjusted basis, we were essentially flat for the quarter. On the consumer
side, we continue to see steady growth in our prime/super-prime auto book. This was offset by a decrease in our
commercial portfolios, which was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage warehouse balances. While
commercial loan balance growth slowed in the back half of the year, we still saw loan balance growth by 5%
relative to 2022 on an adjusted basis.
Moving to the income statement. Funding cost pressures have lingered in this dynamic rate environment, but this
pressure has continued to abate each quarter. Here in Q4, our net interest income was essentially flat versus Q3,
and our NIM decreased by just 2 basis points. Due to the mid-quarter timing of our Q4 balance sheet transaction,
we expect to see full benefit from our asset sales beginning in Q1 of 2024.
Regards to non-interest income, our GAAP number is impacted by onetime items tied to our balance sheet
repositioning during Q4. But on an adjusted basis, we saw another slight quarterly increase. Taken together,
despite the significant funding cost pressures the industry experienced in 2023, we were still able to grow our total
adjusted revenue by 5% for the year.
In 2023, we're once again able to demonstrate an ability to control our expense run rate by identifying cost saves
in underperforming areas and redirecting those funds into targeted investments that help us grow our customer
base, deepen relationships and enhance our profitability profile. We did see a slight uptick in personnel expense
late in the year, but that was largely driven by the acceleration of our previously announced hiring plan through
our initiatives.
As we execute on our growth strategy, our conservative credit culture remains foundational, and we've continued
to monitor asset quality closely. In Q4, our NCO ratio decreased 4 basis points and our ACLL ratio increased by 6
basis points. We continue to see modest signs of a gradual normalization to pre-COVID levels, but have not yet
seen indications of broader issues impacting specific industries or geographies.
Now, with several extraordinary items impacting our financials during the fourth quarter, we provided a detailed
breakdown of EPS impacts from notable onetime items on slide 3. These items can be summarized into two
categories. First, the balance sheet repositioning we announced during the quarter impacted our income
statement through a $133 million net loss from the sale of mortgages and another $65 million net loss on the
security sale we completed. Combined, these losses impacted our GAAP EPS by $1.30.

Secondly, the FDIC special assessment added $31 million to our non-interest expense during the quarter, which
further impacted GAAP EPS by $0.20. Net of tax, our EPS came in at a positive $0.53 for the quarter. This
adjusted number underscores the strength of our business, gives us confidence that we're on the right path with
our strategic plan. And importantly, it sets us up for continued success in 2024.
On slide 4, we provide a bit more context for why we're bullish heading into 2024. As we've discussed previously,
the first phase of our strategic plan announced back in 2021 was about laying the foundation through the addition
of new loan verticals, new relationship-focused deposit gathering initiatives and the launch of an open architecture
digital platform that enables us to control our own destiny.
Through these efforts, we've proven that we can execute as a company by driving diversified loan growth, riding
the ship of the multiyear pattern of household attrition and achieving three-year highs in digital customer
satisfaction. The second phase of our strategy is designed to build on our momentum and position us for the
future success of the company. This plan was dynamic in that it enables us to address expenses, enhance
organic growth and accelerate balance sheet repositioning inorganically, all at the same time.
We knew we need to start by managing expenses, and we did, by identifying and executing on $25 million to $30
million expense run rate reductions, including a 3% reduction in force, around the branch closures and additional
spending cuts. These actions, while difficult, set us up to reinvest dollars into initiatives that will help us accelerate
household growth, deepen relationships, remix our balance sheet and improve our profitability profile.
During the fourth quarter, we also completed a sale of mortgage loans and securities designed to further
accelerate the financial benefits of our organic initiatives by disposing of low-yielding assets and high-cost
funding. We sold nearly $1 billion of low-yielding mortgages and nearly $800 million of securities, enabling us to
free up funding capacity and reinvest at higher rates.
Now, successful execution of any strategy hinges on having the right talent in the right places. And we've made
significant strides in bolstering our leadership team with top talent across the Midwest, who align with our culture
and have a skill set to drive our plan forward. As our plans picked up steam in the marketplace, we're seeing that
the message is resonating, not just for our customers or our existing colleagues, but for the others in the industry,
who have started to view Associated Bank as an employer of choice.
It's how we've been able to grow our RM base by 33% since 2021 and it's how we've been able to add talented
leaders across key business segments in the past 12 months. Attracting top talent is the first step towards
execution, and it's clear we're off to a strong start.
Moving to slide 6. The second wave of organic initiatives we announced back in November are on track. In fact, in
some cases, we're ahead of schedule. In the 2.5 months since we made our announcement, we made significant
progress adding commercial and small business RMs throughout our footprint. We've also already launched
several marketing, product and digital initiatives, designed to drive customer acquisition, relationship deepening
and retention. We expect to continue to roll these enhancements out as a steady cadence throughout 2024.
Taken together, between the success we've seen in Phase 1 of our initiatives and the progress we've already
made in Phase 2 of our initiatives, we're well on our way down the path to building a higher return profile for our
company. That's what gives us confidence as we get into 2024 and beyond.
With that, I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the fourth quarter, beginning on slide 7. As we've
discussed previously, the first half of 2023 was marked by industry-wide volatility and an ongoing battle for
5

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
deposits. These dynamics combined to drive significant funding cost pressures and forced banks to rethink their
funding strategies. While we're not immune from this volatility at Associated, we saw meaningful stabilization of
balance flows and cost pressures in Q3, and that stabilization carried forward into Q4.
In this more stable environment, the impacts of our relationship-focused deposit gathering initiatives were seen
much more clearly throughout the back half of the year. After growing core customer deposits by 2% in Q3, we
saw incremental core deposit growth of another 1% in Q4. In both quarters, we saw net growth in both consumer
and commercial loan balance â€“ commercial deposit balances, demonstrated the broad-based impact of our
deposit gathering efforts.
During the fourth quarter, we also did flex into some brokered CDs as a means to help pay down FHLB advances,
which decreased by $1.8 billion during the quarter. As a reminder, our strategy is to fund our loan growth primarily
with customer deposits. We expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in check as we move through 2024.
And we remain confident in our ability to fund our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our
initiatives.
On slide 8, we show an annual view of our deposit trends. We've consistently grown our average annual deposits
as our balance sheet has expanded over the years, and 2023 was no different. With that said, our 2023 annual
deposit numbers clearly demonstrate a mix shift from non-interest-bearing products into higher-yielding savings
and CD accounts.
This dynamic reflects the impact of the rising rate environment and the period of volatility we saw in the first half of
the year. And as mentioned, however, the back half of the year told a different story. While our core customer
deposit shrank by 2% during 2023, they grew by over 3% in the back half of the year.
On slide 9, you'll see our deposit growth has come as a direct result of initiatives. Our deposit initiatives are
designed to attract new customers, deepen existing relationships and enhance retention. Throughout 2023, we've
seen proof points confirming we're on the right track across the bank.
As of the fourth quarter, our consumer household acquisition rate was up 19% versus the same period a year ago
and our attrition was down 7%. For the full year, our household levels were essentially flat, but we consider this a
key turning point for household growth as it comes on the heels of multiple years of shrinking total households.
Digital has also been instrumental in our success, and we continue to make regular enhancements to our
offerings after a very busy 2023. Recent launches include an upgraded digital platform for commercial customers
and a tool that provides easier switching for new checking customers.
Finally, since launching our new mass affluent strategy, we've added over $730 million in net new deposits in this
segment during 2023, more than doubling our full year goal. This growth represents a roughly 14% increase from
our pre-launch baseline. In the face of a very challenging environment in 2023, we've steadily continued to
execute this plan with proven results. In 2024, we expect to drive core customer deposit growth between 3% and
5%.
Moving to slide 10. We highlight our loan trends through the fourth quarter. On a quarterly average basis, loan
balances grew by $68 million, but they decreased by $977 million on an end-of-period basis, a reflection of the
$969 million mortgage loan sale that settled towards the end of December. On both an average and period-end
basis, Q4 loan growth was led by our auto finance business, where we continue to steadily add prime and super-
prime balances to our book.

As a reminder, we do not intend to become disproportionately reliant on auto loans. But we view this portfolio as a
means to diversify our customer book with high-quality, yield-friendly loans without stretching on credit.
On the commercial side, we saw growth from our utilities business, offset by net outflows in other verticals,
including mortgage warehouse and general C&I. Within the C&I bucket, the quarterly outflow was primarily driven
by a subset of lower-quality credits strategically moved out of the bank at par.
Across our broader portfolio, we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes relationships, quality and
diversification, while delivering accretive returns. This enables us to deemphasize lower-yielding, non-relationship
asset classes over time.
On slide 11, we show loan trends on an annual basis. Average annual loans grew by $3.3 billion in 2023, a trend
that reflects the torrid pace of broad-based loan growth we saw in the back half of 2022. Point-to-point, we grew
total loans by over $400 million during 2023, and that 1% growth figure is inclusive of the $969 million in mortgage
balances that were pulled off our books in December. Excluding that sale, we saw total loan growth of nearly $1.4
billion or 5% for the year.
Consistent with the rest of the industry, it's clear that lending activity is slow going into the end of the year as our
customers took a more cautious approach in the uncertain macro environment. With that said, we've continued to
see encouraging signs of activity in our markets. We also expect to benefit over time from the key leaders and
RMs we've already hired throughout our footprint as they get up and running. Taking into account the current
lending environment and the anticipated impacts of our initiatives, we expect to drive total loan growth of 4% to
6% in 2024.
With that, I'll pass it to Derek to walkthrough the income statement and capital trends. Derek?

Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our asset and liability rate trends through the year-end on slide 12. While Fed funds
rates stabilized in the back half of 2023, our total asset yields have continued to rise due to our remixing loan
book and the repricing nature of a large segment of commercial loans.
Since the fourth quarter of 2021, total earning assets have increased by 292 basis points or roughly 56% of the
increase in Fed funds target rate over the same period. This trend has been led by rising yields in commercial,
CRE and auto, respectively.
On the liability side, it's no secret that rising rates, liquidity pressures and a mix shift in customer deposits
combined to create significant funding cost pressure for the industry in the first half of 2023. In the back half of the
year, however, these trends stabilized meaningfully at Associated.
In aggregate, our interest-bearing liability costs have now increased by 328 basis points since the fourth quarter
of 2021 or roughly 62% of the move in Fed funds target. Our interest-bearing deposit beta has now climbed to
roughly 59% since the start of the rate cycle.
On the left side of slide 13, you can see clear evidence of this stabilization pattern in our net interest income and
net interest margin trends. Our NIM decreased by 27 basis points in Q2, 9 basis points in Q3 and only 2 basis

points here in Q4. On a dollar basis, our Q4 NII was essentially flat, decreasing by less than $1 million during the
quarter.
While it's true that this flattening effect was a function of the stabilization I described previously, we also received
partial benefit from the balance sheet repositioning we announced during Q4. Because the sale of mortgage loans
did not officially settle until late December, the benefit we saw was primarily driven by the securities sale and
reinvestment that settled in November.
Assuming both transactions were completed at the beginning of Q4, this would have represented approximately
11 basis points of incremental lift to our NIM during the quarter. We expect the full impact of our balance sheet
repositioning to take hold here in the first quarter.
As we've discussed throughout the year, however, we're not relying solely on the rate environment or balance
sheet repositioning to dictate our earnings going forward. Our organic initiatives are designed to improve
economics on both sides of the balance sheet to drive more durable interest income in future quarters.
Whether it's adding high-quality customer loans, attracting and deepening core customer deposit relationships or
layering in interest rate hedges, these actions have been designed to enable our company to achieve a higher
level of profitability through the cycle.
Altogether, the funding cost pressures from elevated rates and mix shift have slowed to a trickle, but they haven't
stopped completely. As such, we've not yet called the bottom on our NIM that we believe we're nearly there.
Based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, we expect net interest
income growth of between 2% and 4% in 2024. This guidance assumes six 25 basis point Fed rate cuts
throughout the year, beginning in March.
On slide 14, we continue to manage our securities book to remain within our 18% to 20% target during the fourth
quarter. With benefits of our securities repositioning starting to take hold in Q4, the average yield on our securities
book is now risen by 86 basis points since the same period a year ago. We also leveraged the securities
repositioning as a way to build our cash position during Q4.
Largely as a result of the macro rate improvements we saw during the quarter and our securities sale, we saw a
meaningful improvement in our AOCI in Q4. After adjusting our CET1 capital ratio to include the impacts of AOCI,
this impact would have represented a 52 basis point hit to CET1 in Q4. The spread of this impact narrowed
significantly when compared to Q3. As a percentage of total assets, our investment security and cash positions
grew to roughly 21% during Q4. For 2024, we will continue to target investments to total assets of between 18%
to 20%.
Our non-interest income trends are highlighted on slide 15. As Andy mentioned, our GAAP results reflected a net
loss for the fourth quarter, and this loss was driven by onetime items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we
announced in November.
Specifically, we recognized a onetime $136 million loss on the sale of mortgages and another $65 million loss on
the securities sale. Adjusting for these results, our fourth quarter non-interest income came in at $70 million,
representing a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter.

Our underlying results were primarily driven by a $6 million gain on the sale of [ph] Visa B (00:24:33) shares,
along with increases in wealth management, capital markets, BOLI and other income. These results were partially
offset by a $5 million decrease in mortgage banking fees and a $2 million decrease in service fees.
Taken together, we view our core trends as evidence of durability in our fee income in a year that was challenged
by market dynamics and changes to fee structure. As we look to 2024, we expect non-interest income to
compress by 0% to 2% as compared to our adjusted 2023 base of $264 million.
Moving to slide 16, our fourth quarter expenses were also heavily impacted by a onetime item. The special
assessment finalized by the FDIC during the quarter resulted in a $31 million expense added to our results.
Excluding this one item, our adjusted non-interest expense came in at $209 million in Q4. The bulk of the
quarterly increase stemmed from investments in our organic initiatives.
Of note, severance associated with the reduction in force we announced in Q4 in tandem with an acceleration of
hiring drove a $4 million increase in personnel expense for the quarter.
As Andy mentioned, we've seen strong momentum in the hiring of talent, whether filling key leadership roles or
adding commercial bankers to our footprint. Thanks to a strong candidate pool and a growing view that
Associated as an employer of choice in the marketplace, we've been able to pull our hiring plans forward. This
acceleration did drive an increase in Q4 expense, but it also positions us to accelerate execution on our strategy.
For the full year 2023, our adjusted non-interest expense came in at $783 million. While we continue to invest in
our strategies to support our growth aspirations, we are committed to keeping expense growth in check over the
long term. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to review our expense base and optimize where possible.
With that in mind, we expect total non-interest expense growth of between 2% and 3% in 2024 off of our adjusted
2023 base of $783 million. We also expect annual operating leverage of between negative 1% and 0% in 2024.
Shifting to slide 17, we saw a 23 basis point improvement in our TCE ratio during the quarter, finishing the year at
7.11%. Our regulatory capital levels fell slightly as a result of the balance sheet repositioning we announced in
Q4, but our CET1 ratio still remains well within our target range at 9.39% as of 12/31.
Given current market conditions and the expectations for short-term rates to remain elevated in the near term, we
expect TCE to remain in the range of between 6.75% and 7.75% in 2024. We also expect CET to remain in the
range of 9% to 10% over the same timeframe.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide us an update on credit quality.

Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start with an allowance update on slide 18. We've utilized the Moody's November 2023
baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains consistent
with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline forecast contains no additional
rate hikes, slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation.
Our ACLL increased by $5 million during the quarter to $386 million. Our allowance continues to be driven by loan
growth in select areas such as auto, nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the
stability of our Midwest footprint.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
As such, our reserves-to-loan ratio increased by 6 basis points versus the prior quarter and by 10 basis points
versus the same period a year ago, landing at 1.32% in Q4. Note that the loan sale and the corresponding
portfolio reduction contributed 3 basis points of the 6 total increase or a 1.29% adjusted from 1.26% in Q3.
Moving to slide 19, our portfolio has largely continued to hold up well as evidenced by our core credit quality
trends. During the fourth quarter, we saw net decreases in non-performing assets, non-accrual loans and charge-
offs.
We did see a slight uptick in our delinquent loans ratio during the quarter. This increase from recent levels was
primarily focused within a few credits managed by our special loan group. As with many workout credits,
negotiations can be prolonged, and the resolution for most of these credits did not take place until after year-end.
Overall, outside of these specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of delinquencies
around the bank. Also impacting this ratio is the mortgage sale we completed in Q4, reducing the denominator by
the $969 million, this sale represented about a 1 basis point of impact.
In Q4, we added another $21 million in provision, a $1 million decrease from the prior quarter. The decrease was
the result of a $3 million release from mortgage sale, partially offset by a build from limited credit movement and
macro trends.
As we shift into 2024, we remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty in the macro economy to ensure current
underwriting reflects the elevated inflation, supply chain disruption and labor cost, to name just a few economic
concerns.
In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio,
including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. Going forward, we expect any provision
adjustments to continue to reflect changes in risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes and other indications
of credit quality.
Finally, as we've done in prior quarters, we've provided a refreshed set of key metrics for our CRE portfolio on
slide 20. As we've discussed, our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past
several years, as we've built a diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial loans across our portfolios and a focus
on prime and super-prime consumer portfolios.
While CRE continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry, we feel well positioned given the conservative
approach we've applied across the bank. In building our CRE portfolio, we've focused on partnering with well-
known developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable Midwest markets. Over two-third of our CRE
portfolio is based in the Midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties.
Office loans represent just 3.26% of our total loans as a bank. And within that portfolio, we are weighted towards
non-urban Class A properties. The uptick in delinquencies were some of those same special loan group credits
referenced earlier.
We continue to take a proactive approach to CRE office credits, with the majority of those maturing in the first half
of 2024, already having strategies in place, whether that be refinanced sale or qualifying for extensions at
prevailing underwriting standards. While we feel well positioned given our business model approach in the
markets we operate in, we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely.

So, I'll close out our formal presentation by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 21.
First, our strategy is designed to drive quality, relationship-focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on
lower yielding, non-relationship balances, and enhances our profitability profile.
Based on the expected benefits of our plan and the current macro outlook, we expect total loan growth of
between 4% and 6% in 2024. On the other side of the balance sheet, the deposit environment is much more
stable than it was just six months ago, but it remains competitive.
Coming off two straight quarters of core deposit growth gives us confidence we're on the right track with our
initiatives, and we expect to benefit further as Phase 2 initiatives ramp up. As such, we expect core customer
deposit growth of 3% to 5% in 2024.
Shifting to the income statement, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas
and the rate environment. Our current forecast assumes six Fed rate cuts beginning in March. Taking all these
factors into account, we now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between 2% and 4% in 2024.
And lastly, our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our company. While we'll
continue to seek smart investments for organizational growth, we will look to offset those costs where possible by
shifting dollars from underperforming areas. Taken together with current marketing conditions, we expect non-
interest expense growth of 2% to 3% in 2024.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe just starting with a clarification on the margin guidance, first.
When you say you're not calling a bottom on the NIM, but it could move down slightly. I'm assuming you're taking
into account the 11 basis point benefit of the restructuring and like a pro forma NIM before that, or is it â€“ are you
talking about on an absolute basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Let me start that off, and I'll have Derek finish that. Daniel, what we're saying is the core underlying business
outside of the inorganic action is pretty close to bottom. Could it go down 1 basis point or 2 basis points?
Perhaps, but we're pretty darn close. We don't see a lot of volatility in the underlying margin. On top of that, we
expect to see the full force of the increase that we outlined from the inorganic actions starting in Q1. And then
based on what we're doing on our production and balance sheet, we expect to have a positive trend throughout
the year. Derek?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think that's right. And you're right, we're talking about looking at our start point levels at the pro forma 279.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure. And then I guess â€“ sorry. Go ahead. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. No, just following up on the NIM guidance. You've got six rate cuts in there. Wondering if you can kind of
frame for us what that looks like either on a per cut basis or if it was going to be more in line with the Fed's
guidance of three cuts in the back half of the year, how that would impact the guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think the easiest â€“ the only way we've modeled this [ph] probably most (00:36:21) recently to developing
sensitivities is what if you don't get the first cut. So, you get five cuts and that pulls through, you don't get the
March cut. That's probably worth about 2 or 3 basis points to us for the year.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just to be clear, so the rate cut is punitive to the margin you're saying, right? You're still asset sensitive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We are still asset sensitive. You can get into a longer discussion about what â€“ do you â€“ does the front end of the
curve get cut, or do you have a parallel shift? But the most likely scenario is we've tried to plan conservatively with
the six rate cuts and then thought about what if you don't get all six, and that does reflect asset sensitivity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate that. And then my second question, I just wanted to get a little high level here. Andy, you guys
have taken on some pretty big changes since you've been at Associated. I'm just curious, given the uncertainty
going forward, but certainly what you've â€“ the changes that you've made, if there's any kind of profitability forecast
â€“ or not forecast, but targets that you had in mind that you could share, or just kind of guideposts that we should
be thinking about as the bank goes through these transformations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Daniel, I just want to say, we expect profit to go up, and I was going to stop after that. But in all seriousness, what
I would say is the plans that we've put together, when you expand your lending verticals, when you expand your
product offering, when you modernize your digital platform and decrease your attrition, when you see a turning
point on household growth, when you start deepening customer segments on the deposit side, the reason that we
think that we have an opportunity is because we've put in the work in Phase 1.
Phase 2 is simply extending what we've done in the past. So, when we extend on the commercial side the pieces
that we've had, when we extend on the marketing side to the platforms that we already have, with a company that
has a large wholesale reliance on the funding side, we can either replace that or fund the loan growth we have.
And either way, that leads to increased profitability. So, what I would say is I don't have a specific number outside
of the guidance we've just now given, but we feel very good about achieving the guidance that we've given.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Derek, wanted to â€“ I guess I just want to try to be as
clear as possible on the margin. So just on a stated basis, the margin should go up, right, from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Right, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, good. And the starting point for sort of the core at this point is like the 279 and we get some additional
benefit due to the full-quarter impact of the restructuring, is that a good way to frame it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So just to connect the dots, we expected about a 16 basis point improvement, right? We got â€“ ended up
getting about 5 of it this quarter. We got another 11 to go. And so, any other movement in NIM is the underlying
BAU.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And I think that's what Andy is trying to get out about [ph] whether we're (00:39:55) calling the bottom. But on a
reported basis, we expect to go up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Andy, just on the notion of positive operating leverage, and it's going to be
sort of close call this year, it kind of feels to me like a rounding error, more or less, if it's zero to negative 1%. I
guess maybe major levers that, in your view, would make it harder or easier to achieve. And I guess sort of a
related question, Derek, just to go back on the trajectory of rates if we only got â€“ if we got fewer rates than the six
you've assumed, that would be better for your NII guide, is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A

Correct.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Going back to it, I mean, I don't want to be contrite on this, but we're in the business of doing loans and
deposits. And the deposit market, if we had a significant headwind, that could create a challenge. What gives me
confidence going into 2024 is the second half of 2023. So, the deposit market was challenged for the year, but we
had a six-month growth rate of 3%. So, clearly, if you have a funding issue that costs more, then you have a
challenge, but we don't see that as of the trend right now.
The second piece of it is that we emphasize with the team is the importance of getting out of the gate with good
commercial bankers. And I say good commercial bankers. We have a very good team already. We've attracted
talent over the last two years that I'm pleased with. And then we have people that were here before that, are
talented. So when we add 10 bankers over the course of 2.5 months, we're adding very high-quality bankers. And
so, it takes 90 days to ramp up, then you accelerate at 6 months, 9 months, 12 months.
So for that, the question is how quickly can we get quality bankers? And the answer so far is quite quickly. The
next question is how quickly can they ramp up their pipeline? And we'll see what that timing is. And so, that could
be a positive for us and that could create the biggest execution risk. But as I sit here and I look at the hiring and
where they come from and what they've done in their past, that gives me some confidence that we're right on
track with what we've suggested.
The third part of it, as I do think expenses are controllable, and going through the exercise â€“ expense exercise
line-by-line, business-by-business, category-by-category in the detail that we went through that and already
outlined it and have specific measurements on it gives me confidence that we'll be able to execute on the
expense line item of the budget.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, Terry, the way â€“ this is Derek. The way it works out in our current forecast is it's pretty flat for most of the
quarters during the year. So, that implies coming down a little bit off the core fourth quarter that we have and then
flat going forward. The hiring plans, obviously, have started this quarter and have been pleasantly â€“ we've had
pleasant results at the speed and interest. So, we don't want to slow that down. And then we obviously look at the
other areas where we have control and discretionary expenses to make sure that we have a balanced timing. But
there's not a hockey stick implied in there. We're mindful of where we're going to finish the year in delivering
economics and setting ourselves up for 2025 also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then the company has aggressive deposit growth goals this year versus peers, and Andy just ran through
what gives you guys the confidence. Derek, I guess, for you, how are you modeling deposit betas? Where do you
think they'll peak? And if the forward curve is correct and we get the rate cuts, how are you thinking about betas
on the way down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, we think they'll peak, obviously, at the end of the first quarter, around 61%, 62%. There's a number of
ways of looking at them. But if you start, the beta's going down, we're probably looking at between 45% and 55%.
The challenge, as you know, is how long after the last rate hike, and hopefully, we've had ours, do [ph] â€“ does
competitions (00:44:47) keep rates high before they start cutting it. And we tested that in the fourth quarter, I may
have shared before, with lowering some of our CD rates and competitors, even large banks kept the rates high.
And so, we went back to our seven-month 5% CD because of that. So, I feel good about our plans. They're not all
rate driven, but rates matter. And so, I think that's [ph] how I'd (00:45:16) answer that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Terry, I'll also reiterate, when I got here almost three years ago now, we were quite asset sensitive. And we've
drawn that asset sensitivity significantly down. So, we're not playing in the same space as we were three years
ago relative to the market or even our bank.

Hey, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Hey, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. A question on loan growth drivers on slide 10 that you lay out, I guess it could be 11 as well. But what do
you think that looks like in a year? Where are you seeing the opportunities to generate that kind of loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, a few different areas. We'll have very modest growth in CRE and be mindful of what the market is. Clearly, if
we add 20 to 25 commercial bankers, we expect for them to increase their productivity. And right now, we're
saying that should be about â€“ for the year, I think it's roughly $0.25 billion increase versus what run rate is. Then
the question of what run rate really is, and I would tell you that I think utilization was slightly down last year and I
think that's unlikely. I think there is a dislocation in the regional banking market that I don't anticipate having again
this year.
We had some purposeful runoff in C&I that we were able to get out of some loans at par that we thought would be
wise if there's softening. And so, when I look at commercial, I think between the quality of people we have and the
program we have and the focus we have and those other items I mentioned and the addition of RMs, I fully expect
that to be one of the significant drivers of growth for us. We'll have steady growth in auto, and that steady growth
will kind of grow at a decreasing pace each year that we go along as we execute on our commercial plans.
The other thing is â€“ and I know you asked about 2024, but this is a program that continues to build on itself. As
you well know, when you bring in quality commercial bankers, it takes time for them to grow their pipeline and
their portfolio. But as we head to the end of the year, having had people on as we got 10 people on, and we will
have significant amounts of this hiring done in the first half of the year, meaning that they will have fully formed
pipelines as we head into the end of the year, heading into 2025. So, I think you can see that as a continuation of
the balanced re-shift of our portfolio that leads to profitability improvement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Jon, Maybe I can add one titbit also because Andy will remind me later that I didn't bring it up. We do expect, and
as part of our strategy with the transaction we did for the portfolio growth, to change from a residential real estate
orientation that we had before. So, we are in that business. We have switched our product mix and made
17


Associated Banc-Corp

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
investments to support originate to sell and then judiciously use our portfolio for ARMs and wealth. But that mix of
our total loans should drop by the end of 2024 to about 25% of our loans being resi; and in 2025, something more
like 23%. So, you sort of have to have that piece in the equation to help make the NII and the NIM guidance work
the way we expect it to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And translated from mortgage, the importance of that is we're doggedly determined to lend to our customers. Our
customers [ph] defined (00:49:15) that people that do full business relationships, people that deposit with us and
tend to do that on the construction lending side for depositors and intend to do that on our core business, but the
third-party origination is something that we no longer do. And that will change the trajectory over time of the
residential real estate book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Got it. And I guess mass affluent is probably tied in with that as well on resi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It absolutely is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Just two more kind of more hypothetical, but back to Scott's positive operating leverage question.
Andy, would you be spending and investing more if the revenue environment were more robust, or do you feel like
you have everything you need from a budget point of view right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
That's a great question. Well, what I would say is we're being pretty aggressive on the hiring on the commercial
banker side. And no, we're not looking to fill seats, we're looking to hire talent. And so as we get good folks in, if
there's an opportunity, I've said all along to each line of business, if you find somebody that you believe is a game
changer, you should hire them. So, we will. But that being said, there's only so fast you're going to be able to hire
responsibly. And so we like the plan that we have. If we add the 20 to 25 bankers this year and they're all very
strong, I like where this company is going, based on everything else that we have in flight.
That being said, I promised halfway through the year I will be asking our executive leaders, okay, now what?
What's next on the deposit front? What other initiatives can drive returns? What is the next phase of what we see
being important in banking? And to me, really, that's just the way you stay ahead of the curve. And I will tell you,
over the last, almost, three years now, I felt like we had a first phase, and we ran hard to get that as foundational.
The second phase is additive, and the third phase is let's get ahead of the market. So, I like the path we're on,
and we'll think about investments that way, frankly, for as long as I'm here.

Hey, Timur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at the deposit guidance for 2024, can you just maybe talk us through the expectation for mix shift and
what the potential for mix shift out of non-interest-bearing remains here in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
You want to take that, Derek?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I'll take â€“ I'll answer the first part of it. The big challenge, obviously, has been â€“ aside from interest-bearing,
has been what's happening in the non-interest-bearing. That has slowed down quite a bit. The way we've got our
outlook shaping up is we expect us to bottom at about $5.8 billion or $5.9 billion, and then finish the year up a little
over $6 billion. I know people use the shorthand of percent of deposits, but that includes brokered and it's just
easier for us to communicate the absolute dollar expectation, and that's what's in our guidance and our
expectations.

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And I'll just say that a different way is that we're a pretty low point on non-interest-bearing. It's what gives me
confidence to say that I don't think there's a big story in margin destruction in the first quarter. So whether we call
bottom right now or we call it during the first quarter, I think you're only talking 0, 1 or 2 basis points. And so, I
think the story comes into can you shift your balance sheet? Can you bring in full relationships? Can you put
loans on the books that have a little bit better yield? And can you grow deposits, overall? So, I think from a
position of margin decrease, I think we're quickly closing in on the bottom.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then as we start looking at rate cuts, Derek, did I hear correct that beta's on the way
down, you're expecting 45% to 55%? And if that's not correct, and I guess, on the way down, what do you expect
the deposit beta to be? And is there going to be a lag for the first couple of rate cuts before that beta actually kicks
in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
That assumption includes a lag assumption, but I can't say we've formalized a view on it. We're going to try and
be as early as we can while still hitting our growth numbers, and we position the balance sheet that way. Our
brokered CD portfolio has a contractual maturity that runs the whole thing down and gives us options by the end
of the year. And of our $2.8 billion in the customer CDs, $1.7 billion of that is scheduled to roll over this year, and
95% of that by the end of July. So, we're trying to be very opportunistic while still growing and giving us lots of
pricing options so that we can take advantage of any opportunities and keep the beta where we'd like to have it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then, just last for me, you mentioned this briefly in your prepared comments, but maybe can you just
talk to the cadence of office paydowns in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Office paydowns? Yeah, I mean, we saw, I think, in 2023, a good trend of office. We had a handful of probably
half of the deals that we came through. Our maturities, end of 2023, were payoffs. I think it's still going to be kind
of a similar pattern, but it's all case-by-case. We've got about â€“ I think the ones that were kind of circled for the
first half of 2024, about 40% of them are going to either refinance or sell, and that's the strategy put in place. The
others are going to â€“ well, we have extensions in place or they qualified for extensions, but that's under the
current environment. So, it's still a mixed bag.
Clients are starting to â€“ the office market is hard to tell. I think that stabilization is still early to call that. I think in
other areas, we're seeing payoffs from multifamily, as long-term rates have come down, I think we're starting to
see a lot of clients kind of move off the sidelines there, and the industrial market as well, we're still â€“ it's not as hot
as it was two years ago, certainly, but still a pretty steady pace of lease-up and, therefore, sale in that asset class
as well.

is holding up. We're all over both the office portfolio and the overall CRE portfolio. And frankly, the experience
level of our bankers in the CRE group is very strong. And I think relative to the industry, we feel pretty good about
the position we're in. Certainly, it could be lumpy as time goes by, but have a pretty good handle on that. Thank

Hi. This is Nick Moutafakis on for Chris McGratty. How are you guys doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A

Good, Nick.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Moutafakis Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe just on the capital levels, given as we move through 2024 and further out, any appetite for a buyback or
even further tweaking or derisking of the loan portfolio as we look more longer term?

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Nick, I like our organic plan. If we can hire the most talent in the industry and grow our balance sheet in the key
areas that we have, I believe the investment community will be happy with the return. So, that's where our entire
focus is right now.
With regards to another action on the portfolio, we don't have anything planned there at this time. And buybacks,
that is not front and center for me. I think we have ways to use our capital that we'll be happy with the midterm
and long-term results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Moutafakis Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just on the cash flow from the bond book, do you guys have like the quarterly cadence of
runoff for the securities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
It's about 150 to 200. And because we're growing it with fixed assets, you would expect to reinvest maybe [ph]
$300 million (00:58:40). So, think of a 150, 200 runoff, [ph] $300 million (00:58:43) purchase quarter. And then the
spread on that, the runoff rate versus the buy rate would be 150, 200 basis point difference.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Moutafakis Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you for taking my questions.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hey, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. I just wanted to ask a handful of questions on the NII. Derek, just want to put a finer point on the beta
commentary. Was that 45% to 55% what you expect to achieve by year-end 2024, or is that more of a comment
about what it will be over the next couple of years?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
That's March to December of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
March to December. Thank you very much for that. Within the core deposit growth guidance that you guys have
laid out, how much of that is coming from CDs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I don't think we've provided that level of detail. I think it's going to depend on the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I'd be happy to [ph] go through (01:00:00) the mix detail I gave you already on the non-interest-bearing deposits
and the residential real estate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I want it all, Derek, [indiscernible] (01:00:09).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I wanted to say it, when you said five questions or six questions or whatever it was.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I did ask, Derek, why he's providing so much detail, and he said Brody demands it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
This is true. I'm a little bit of a pain in the butt. I just wanted to also ask on the BTFP. I noticed in the appendix you
kind of called out how much you have in capacity. I wanted to ask how much of the BTFP you've used at this
point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
As of the end of the year, none.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
None. Okay. Thank you very much for that. I felt like I had one more for you guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
That said, Brody, I feel compelled â€“ Brody, I feel compelled to say that I wouldn't be afraid to draw on that. In fact,
I think there's a reason that it's put in place, and if we can get advantageous terms relative to the market, then
we'll use it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Last couple for me on the loan growth guide, wanted to better understand, another mix question, how much
of that â€“ how much of the growth you're expecting to come from the auto portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We're looking at similar levels that you've seen quarter-after-quarter. So in dollar terms, it's about $200 million to
$250 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then the last one I had for you just on the auto yields, the pickup this quarter was pretty strong at 35
basis points. Wanted to understand if given the growth guidance that you just outlined for auto, what we can
expect for maybe the yield cadence from a repricing perspective within that book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We're not providing that specific guidance on that. Nice try.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
But I think you had a nice pickup from the fourth quarter. Look, the business is a good business for us, and the
average FICO in December was 786. So when you think about an opportunity, when you see the yields that we're
getting and you see the quality of the credit, we've said before we don't want to just be the auto bank, but it's a
nice portfolio for us that is performing well, that we're getting a good yield on and has a very, very strong
underlying credit [ph] with that (01:02:27).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. What is fair to say, Brody, despite my snarky comment there, was the spreads that we've seen, and I've
talked about the sweet spot has been getting sweeter, I think I've said that a couple of times, it really did stay that
way fourth quarter and it has stayed that way now. So, the inputs that are driving that sequential type of rate
increase are still strong.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Most of the book â€“ is most of your auto business used â€“ used car auto â€“ used autos?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
No. Maybe two-thirds or so, 70%, I think in the last quarter was what we saw in the used stuff.
