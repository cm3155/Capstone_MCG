Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Kerri. Good morning and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Q3 was our
seventh consecutive quarter of strong performance, continuing the momentum we've built over the last few years
and aligned with the growth plan we announced in 2022. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues,
which reached $15.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $3.30 was also a new quarterly record.
Based on our performance to date, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full-year revenue growth and EPS
growth that is consistent with the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And we are well-
positioned as we seek to achieve our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and
mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady-state macro environment.
My confidence is based on several factors, including the many attractive opportunities available to us because of
the businesses and geographies we operate in. Our unique membership model, which powers a virtuous cycle of
growth. The success of the strategic investments we've been making in key areas of our business, and our ability
to leverage our differentiated business model, which includes our premium global customer base, integrated
payments platform, strong partner relationships, and trusted brand.

Together, these factors have driven our strong performance over the past two years, including the continued
momentum we saw in the third quarter. In the quarter, Card Member spending remained strong, up 7% year-over-
year on an FX-adjusted basis. Spending was strongest in our US Consumer segment, up 9%, and International
Card Services segment up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis, and US small business spending increased slightly
from a year-ago.
Millennial and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our Card Member base, with
spending from this demographic in the US up 18% year-over-year, and they accounted for more than 60% of all
new consumer account acquisitions globally in the quarter. Demand for our products remain robust, particularly
for fee-based products, which represented more than 70% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter.
Customers continue to be highly satisfied with our products and services, which drives high levels of engagement
and retention. We were rated the number one US credit card company for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for
the fourth consecutive year and the 13th time in 17 years of the study, and our credit metrics remain best-in-class
as we continue our focus on growing with discipline and a strong focus on risk management across the portfolio.
A key reason for the momentum we're seeing is the investments we've been making in innovating our value
propositions to deliver generational relevance across all age groups. Resy is a good example of some of the ways
we're doing this. We acquired Resy and continued to invest in building out the platform, because we know that
dining is something that all generations of Card Members care about.
We've seen that in our results, as restaurants continued to be the largest and one of the fastest-growing T&E
categories in the third quarter. The number of Resy users, restaurants on the platform, and reservations booked
all continue to grow significantly. In Q3, reservations on the platform set another quarterly record.
Over the last few years, we've also ramped up the number of exclusive lifestyle experiences, sponsorships, and
access to events we offer that appeal to our Card Members across generations and geographies and reinforce
the unique value of membership. Our highly popular experiences cut across entertainment, sports, food, art, and
fashion. They generate strong on-site engagement with our branded activities and offers, and they help drive
interest among prospects.
They also continue to attract world-class partners who work with us to add new ways for our Card Members and
prospects to experience the power of Amex membership. Earlier this week, we announced our latest sponsorship,
an exclusive multi-year agreement with Formula 1 to be the official payments partner of Formula 1 in the
Americas. This sponsorship is our first new sports vertical in over 10 years, and it represents a great opportunity
to build on a rapidly growing popularity of formula 1 racing around the world.
Another way we're delivering generational relevance is by regularly refreshing and adding value to our products
on a global basis. These product enhancements are tailored to the interest and spending patterns of our
customers of all age groups in each local market. So far this year, we've made enhancements to over 20 premium
products across the company, some of the latest of which were refreshes of our Platinum Card products in Japan,
our Business Gold Card in the US, and just yesterday our Hilton co-branded consumer cards.
These examples and many others like them are further enriching our membership model, which helps us to attract
new premium customers, drive retention and deepen engagement with current customers, and add more
merchants and partners who provide offers and experiences that deliver additional value. Looking ahead, I feel
very good about where we are and where we're going. We'll continue our strategy of investing for growth and

adding more differentiated value to our membership model to deliver generational relevance while continuing to
leverage the strengths of our business model, all of which gives us a competitive advantage.
I'll now hand the call over to Christophe Le Caillec for additional details on our quarterly results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have my first earnings call be one where we
discuss our continued strong momentum, which is reflected in our record revenue and EPS in the third quarter. I
would like to take a minute at the outset to share my perspective on the company as someone who has been here
for a long time and through various business environments.
The company is very focused on driving high levels of profitable revenue growth. The key enabler of that growth
has been the discipline we use to deploy our resources. As a result, the underlying quality of our business is very
strong, and I have confidence in the sustainability of the growth drivers that we are seeing.
We have accelerated the pace of our revenue and EPS growth since before the pandemic. That acceleration is a
direct result of the strategy that underpins our growth plan, which Steve described. In the quarter, that strategy
has driven $27 billion more in billings versus last quarter. The company is also generating almost $2 billion more
in revenue and about $600 million more in net income compared to a year ago. This demonstrates the earnings
power of our business model.
Now, let's take a look at the details of this quarter's performance. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2.
Third quarter revenues were $15.4 billion. They reached a record high for the sixth straight quarter and were up
13% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of
$3.30, which grew 34% year-over-year.
Let's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results. In our spend-centric business model, that
begins with a look at billed business starting on slide 3.
Total billed business grew $27 billion this quarter versus last year, up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis as we continue
to see the more stable growth rates that we expected. This growth was driven by 6% growth in Goods & Services
spending, consistent with last quarter's growth rate and sustained double-digit growth in travel and entertainment
spending. This double-digit T&E growth has been driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences,
with restaurant spending, our largest category, up 13% this quarter.
Total network volumes grew 6% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you look at these results, I'd note
that we exited a small product last quarter that was reported in our processed volumes. This is reflected in the Q3
growth rate and expect to see the impact of the year-over-year growth rate continue for the next few quarters until
we lap this exit.
As a reminder, processed volume includes volumes from cards where we play more of a network role and from
alternative payment solutions that we facilitate. The revenue associated with these volumes makes up a small
portion of our total revenue, which you can see on slide 11.
As we then break down our spending trends across our businesses, there are a few other key points to take
away. Starting with our largest segment on slide 4, US Consumer grew billings strongly at 9% this quarter. Our
focus on attracting, engaging, and retaining our premium Card Members is driving growth across all generations
5

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
and age cohorts. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest billed business growth within this
segment, with their spending up 18% this quarter.
Looking at Commercial Services on slide 5, US SME growth came in at 2% this quarter, consistent with last
quarter's growth rate. As Steve discussed on our Q2 call, organic growth in this segment has slowed given unique
dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Importantly, we do continue to see strong, high-
quality demand for new accounts within this segment. Looking forward, we focus on continuing to help SME
clients run their businesses.
Billings from our US large and global corporate customers were flat year-over-year. As we have said for many
years, these customers are not a major growth driver for our business but they remain an important foundation for
the company's business model.
And lastly on slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services. We saw strong
growth across our geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from
international SME and large corporate customers each grew 15%. Overall, strength in spending growth from our
US Consumers and Card Members outside of the US continues to offset the softness with Commercial Services
that we've been talking about for the past few quarters.
Taking everything into account, our spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the full
year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were generating pre-
pandemic.
Now, moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth of 15%, as well
as good, continued sequential growth. As our customers continue to rebuild balances, the interest-bearing portion
of our loans and receivables balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see. Importantly, over
70% of our revolving loan growth in the US continues to come from our tenured customers.
As you then turn to credit and provision on slide 8 through 10, the high credit quality of our customer base
continues to show in our best-in-class credit performance. As you can see on slide 8, our Card Member loans and
receivables write-offs and delinquency rates both remain fairly flat to last quarter and below pre-pandemic levels.
Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect this delinquency and write-off
rates to increase over time and they're likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.
Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan
balances, combined with the modest increase in our Card Member loans and receivables delinquency rate,
resulted in a $321 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of
provision expense in the third quarter.
As you see on slide 10, we ended the third quarter with $5 billion of reserves, representing 2.7% of our total loans
and Card Member receivables. This reserve rate remained about 20 basis points below the level we had pre-
pandemic or Day 1 CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit in the balance of year, similar
to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters.
Moving next to revenue on slide 11. Total revenues were up $1.8 billion, or 13% year-over-year in the third
quarter. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 7% year-over-year in Q3, as you can see on slide 12,
driven by spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an FX-
adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 13. This growth remains very strong and is powered by the continued
6

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
attractiveness to both new and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investment we've made
in our premium value propositions.
As we expected, growth moderated a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our
cycle of product refreshes. This quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards. Importantly, the acquisition levels you
see on slide 13 remain consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. The spend, revenue, and credit profiles
of our new Card Members continued to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic.
Moving now on to slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 33% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted
basis, driven mostly by the growth in our revolving loan balances.
To sum up revenues on slide 15, we're seeing broad-based revenue momentum across our diversified revenue
lines. For 2023, we expect revenue growth to be within the range we communicated in January, at around 15%
growth for the full year.
Moving to expenses on slide 16. Variable customer engagement expenses came in at 40% of total revenues in
the third quarter. Therefore, I now expect these costs to run at around 42% of total revenues on the full-year
basis. Looking forward, we view this cost as a key driver of our momentum, as we continue to innovate our value
propositions, to deepen engagement with our premium Card Members, and to attract new ones, as Steve
discussed earlier.
On the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the quarter. I still expect to have marketing spend of around $5.5
billion for the full year, fairly flat to our 2022 expense. We feel really good about the quality of our new card
acquisitions, which I've talked about earlier, and I continue to see great demand for our products across a wide
range of attractive investment opportunities. Given this strong set of opportunities, I would expect to increase our
marketing spend in the balance of this year, and we're confident that our sophisticated acquisition engine will
continue to do so in an efficient way.
Moving to the bottom of slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.7 billion in the third quarter as
we invest in critical areas such as our talented colleague base and technology. Taking this into account, we now
expect our full-year operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion. Looking forward, we continue to view
marketing and OpEx as a key source of leverage.
Turning next to capital on slide 17. We returned $1.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter. This
included common stock repurchase of $1.3 billion and $438 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of
strong earnings generation. As you can see on slide 17, we target a CET1 ratio of between 10% to 11%. We
ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%, which is well-above our current regulatory minimum of 7%.
As we think about the Basel III proposal, the RWA increase could consume the buffer above regulatory capital
requirements if the proposal is adopted as written. Notably, we believe there are clear opportunities for
improvements between the proposal and the final rule. In fact, the regulators themselves have posed questions
about potential issues in applying these rules broadly, and we are actively engaged in that dialogue. We plan to
continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We
do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach.
That brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on slide 18. As Steve and I discussed in our third quarter
results, our third quarter results are a continuation of the strong momentum we've built over the last few years,
evidenced by our performance across diversified revenue streams.

For the full year, we expect revenue growth of around 15%, consistent with the revenue guidance range we
provided at the beginning of the year. As I discussed before, we now expect variable Card Member engagement
expenses to be around 42% of total revenues on a full-year basis, modestly below our original expectation.
On marketing, we still expect to spend around $5.5 billion for the full year. And lastly, we now expect our
operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion this year, modestly above our original expectation, as we invest in
areas critical to our success.
Taking everything together, our earnings per share guidance remains between $11 and $11.40. Looking forward,
we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess
of 10% and mid-teen EPS growth in a steady-state macro environment.
With that, we'll open up the call for your questions in a moment. A final point which relates to our Investor
Relations team here at American Express. Steve and I have decided to move Kerri Bernstein to the critical role of
Corporate Treasurer. I'd like to thank Kerri for leading the IR function during a period of strong performance for
the company. I'd then like to welcome Kartik Ramachandran, our new head of Investor Relations. Kartik was most
recently a key finance leading our US Consumer business and has had a number of finance positions over 11
years with the company.
Now, let me turn it back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. God morning and congrats, Christophe, Kerri, Kartik. Steve, just a question. We hear a lot about the
choppy macro backdrop and its impact on spending. I'm just curious if you've seen any changes, behavioral, over
the past quarter that might make you more sanguine on the outlook or do you feel like your customers are
unphased? And just on a related point, I know the Delta stuff, there's been a lot of headlines on the changes that
Delta's made to the Medallion qualification process. I'm just curious if you've seen any impact. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, thanks, Sanjay. Let me start with Delta first. I think as Delta makes changes, we're in lockstep with
them all the way. And one of the great things about having Delta as a partner is they are a very customer-focused
organization and they made some changes. The team got some reaction and I think they made some other
changes, which I think will be – and have been received in a very good fashion.
But as far as spending or card acquisition, it has had zero impact, so we haven't seen anything from a card
spending on Delta or from a card acquisition. In fact, Delta card spending year-over-year was up almost 20%, so
we feel pretty good about that.
As far as the US Consumer, let's just talk about the US consumer and international consumer. It's still strong. We
had 9% US consumer spending, 6% growth in Goods & Services, 13% growth on T&E, and that continues to be
very strong off a high base. And from an international perspective, we've seen 15% spending from an
International Card Services perspective, and strong both from a Goods & Services and a T&E perspective.
And I think it's important that I'll remind everybody, our card base is a really small piece of the overall US
economy. And one of the reasons we have such great credit metrics is we have a really high-quality Card
Member. And so, at this point in time, they have not been impacted by anything.
But the other thing that I would say is you probably had the same question at this time last year, and I probably
gave you the same answer. And right now, look, we can only manage the business for what we're seeing in our
business, which is still strong growth. And we used the Blue Chip Economic forecast, and that calls for pretty
much more of the same. So, in a steady-state macro environment, I feel really good about delivering on our plan,
as Christophe said. We are well-positioned and, as I said in my remarks, we're well-positioned to continue to
deliver on our growth plan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Look, as a follow-up to Sanjay's question, obviously, it was good to see the solid revenue growth, given the
challenging economic backdrop and you're still talking about double-digit revenue growth next year. But can you
maybe just talk about some of the pieces or the drivers you expect to see, given what's going on in billings
growth? And are you leaning more into lending in order to drive this growth? And then just lastly like, do we need
to see billings to improve in order to be able to drive double-digit revenue growth? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, those are a lot of questions, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I know. Tried to phase one in this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
You actually only asked one, you just put it in multiple parts.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
That's exactly full.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, right. We'll leave that one alone. But when you look at our model, there are many ways for us to grow
revenue. We grow revenue from a billings perspective, we grow revenue from a card fee perspective, and we do
grow revenue from a lending perspective. The current revenue growth that we had – the current billings growth
that we have is in line with what our long-term growth aspirations are. So, where we are from a billings growth
perspective, we feel really good about that.
From a fee perspective, and I like to point this out, is that the major driver of our fee revenue is actually new card
acquisition. It's not raising fees. It's really new card acquisition. And look, we've invested – we're going to invest
approximately $5.5 billion this year. We'll probably step that up next year. So, we're very confident in our card
acquisition, as Christophe said. There are a lot of great opportunities out there for us.

American Express Co.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
And from a lending perspective, and we've mentioned this multiple times, our book today, we believe, is better
than our book was in 2019. And if our Card Members – we continue to lend responsibly and our Card Members
have various needs at various points in time. And I think it's that model, it's our three legged stool of revenue
which will continue to provide confidence that we're going to be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth next
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And maybe, Ryan, I can add one point on the lending side. As Steve said, we have a premium customer base
and we're growing lending of that premium customer base, 70% of the balances are coming from established
Card Members that we know well. So, those Card Members, we know revolve with competitors' products and
historically, we under-index on that. We capture a big share of their spend, a smaller share of that lending, and
what we do in here is just deepening the relationship with them and capturing a bigger share of their revolving
needs.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you and congratulations to everyone. Kerri, it's been great working with you and good luck. So, a question,
Steve, on the SMB business. That's a really important business for you. It's only growing 2%. I think there're large
opportunities there. But can you maybe give a little color on what's going on in SMB and your thoughts about
SMB as we move into 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think this is probably the second quarter in a row it's been low growth. I think a lot of it – a lot of our high
growth was really driven by organic growth, and we haven't seen as much organic growth from a small business
perspective. I think from an acquisition perspective, we're still very happy about the opportunities that are out
there. We're still happy about the lending opportunities that are out there. And I think small businesses went
through a very interesting cycle over the last few years in terms of not having a lot of inventory and stocking up on
inventory.
And so, we're still very positive on small business, albeit the last two quarters were relatively slow. But we share
your perspective that it's still a huge opportunity for us, and it's a big part of our business from a billings
perspective. And to remind people, our small business footprint is across a variety of small businesses, whether
it's restaurant and retail or professional services and construction and so forth. So, we still feel good about it, and I
think that we'll see just when organic does come back, but we're still very positive on small business.

raising the reserve rate modestly as we move forward. Obviously, that's not a function of changing economic

outlook because you don't know what that will be. I'm assuming it's a mix shift issue. Can you talk about that a
little bit in terms of what components are shifting in the mix and the different reserve rates for those products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, the trend, there is like still a bit of normalization going on. So, if you look at our
delinquency rates, they are fairly flat. If you squint a little bit, you're going to see a couple of basis points increase,
and that's effectively what I meant when I said that you should expect that reserve rate to increase a little bit,
where there's still a little bit of normalization happening here. But as you know well, those delinquency rates and
write-off rates are very strong relative to our historical performance and, of course, relative to peers. So, there's
nothing that gives me concern in that comment. It's just to preempt a little bit what we are seeing.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Christophe, on the Basel III Endgame, is the message still unchanged? I mean, it seems like
that's a pretty big increase in RWAs and maybe you might have to ultimately dial back the buybacks at some
point. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, this is, as you know, a complicated set of rules, like over 1,000 pages. So, let me try to summarize it for
you and the way we are thinking about Basel III.
I think the right starting point is to remind ourselves that, first, we generate a lot of capital ROE in the 30% range.
The second element of the starting point is that, although our regulatory capital is at 7%, CET1 at 7%, we actually
operate with a target of 10% to 11%, so that's 300 to 400 basis point north of the regulatory level. And what I
meant to say in my comment was to say that that buffer could be consumed by the Basel III rules, if they're
adopted as currently drafted.
Another way of saying the same thing is that our level of capital today is very healthy, given those rules. I also
need to highlight the fact that in the rules themselves, the regulators post some questions about the applicability
of these rules to businesses such as ours, and they reference the charge card, for instance, business. And as you
know, over 75%, 78% of our revenue comes from fees, but those fees are stable, visible, such as card fees that
we talked about a bit earlier, and we are actively engaged with the regulators to figure out what's the right thing to
do here. So, we'll see where we land. No one knows, but for now, I don't expect any change to our near-term
capital management policies and practices.

Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus a little bit on the spend versus account growth
dynamics. It looks like your average spending per card or account is flattening out, and your account growth is
finally slowing more flat sequentially this quarter even though as you continue to add 3 million new accounts or
12

cards a quarter. And [indiscernible] (00:35:18) the backdrop of your marketing a little bit lower this quarter,
although it sounds like you're going to be leaning back in next quarter to hit that $5.5 billion. So, I guess my
question is, are you seeing something that's causing you to drive a little bit slower account growth here or is there
anything going on with attrition or anything with Delta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No. I think it comes down to timing, and what happens is quarters happen to cutoff on particular days and that's
just the way it is. But no, we're committed to the $5.5 billion overall approximately of marketing. You saw a slight
sequential drop. I think we went under the 3 million for the first time in a while. And we look at account growth as
– or cards acquired from an overall revenue perspective. But we still see tremendous opportunities out there,
which is why we sort of signaled here – more than signaled, we said we're going to raise our marketing expense
for next year as well. So, no, we're not seeing anything at all that gives us pause, and we will continue to acquire
those cards as long as those opportunities are out there. So, you will see a higher level of marketing spending in
the next quarter.

Bill Carcache Q

Can you share any initial thoughts on the open banking rule that the CFPB recently proposed? There's a view that
open banking essentially forces banks to hand over the keys to their customer relationships. I was just hoping you
could speak to any opportunities that may present for Amex.
And then, following up on the capital commentary, Christophe, there's a view that you could reduce your op risk if
you treated the rewards expense as a contra revenue. Any thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Look, as far as FedNow, I think let's just go to the UK. UK has had open banking for 10 years or so, and it's
really had no impact on our business, either positively or negatively. So, I don't really see this as either a big
threat or big opportunity. And I think what I'd like to take you back, Bill, to is what product we're actually offering.
We're offering a membership model product basically, which has lots of different components, other than just
commodity paying. And our product has so many more benefits from a security perspective, a fraud perspective,
13

a dispute perspective than an open banking product would have. And so, I really don't see this as either an
opportunity or as a threat to our business, either in the short term or in the long term.
I will turn the other question over to Christophe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, on Basel, Bill, there are various things that we're discussing with regulators. I don't think it would be useful to
go through the list here this morning on the call, but you raise an important element here, which is that nothing is
really changing in our business, right? We're still doing the exact same thing, and so we need to figure out with
regulators what the right level of capital here and not be dependent upon accounting treatment or anything like
that. So, too early to discuss this in detail. When we have more clarity, we'll provide you with a ton of Basel III
detail.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Pleasure to meet everybody and Kerri, thanks so much for all the help. I was just curious on
your Card Member rewards as a percentage of billed business. It stepped down quite nicely quarter-over-quarter
and year-over-year. I was just curious if you're seeing anything in particular on the utilization of rewards recently
or any commentary around that. Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, yes, our total VCE, I called out, was lower this quarter, about 40%. So, as you know, variable Card
Member engagement – and rewards is the biggest number there. It's a very large expense base. So, we're
constantly looking at when we do product refreshes, when we launch products, we're looking at ways to make
sure that this value proposition works best and we price for this, and there's always changes. There's always
changes as well in terms of how the Card Members choose to redeem their points from one quarter to another.
As you know, we're also adding constantly new redemption partners. That changed the mix in terms of the
weighted average cost per points. So, there's, at any point in time, a lot of variables that will impact that ratio. We
are very focused on making sure that we have the right ratio versus revenue, and we also have the right value
proposition that we'd be compelling in the marketplace. So, it's a little bit lower this quarter.
I think we said 42% for the full year because we are seeing it's a bit better as well from a full-year standpoint. It's
still going to be an area of investments for us. It drives a lot of growth as well. That's one of the key reason why
Card Members sign up for the cards and engage with it, and we're going to keep working on those value
propositions and make sure that we have the right balance here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
The only other point I'll add is that within our value propositions, because of our really premium card base, lots
and lots of partners want to work with us and include benefits within our value propositions to reach our Card
Members. And so, when you look at the overall value proposition, it's just not rewards based. It is partner based,
14


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
and there are different mechanisms from a funding perspective of how that all works out. So, that's part and
parcel of our value proposition as well.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. You continue to outperform on credit, at least very much relative to your peers and below pre-pandemic
levels. What are your thoughts on net charge-offs heading into 2024? And maybe you could touch a little bit on
how the seasoning curves are happening for your recent vintages.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, yeah. So, we're not going to give you a lot of details about 2024 on this call. We plan to do that at the
beginning of next year when we speak about 2024 guidance. But what I can tell you is that the starting point for us
of our credit performance and all our credit decisions is the quality of the products and the fact that it attracts
premium Card Members. That's the starting point, right?
We have a very talented risk organization. We have a very disciplined execution of our risk decision. But it starts
with the quality of the product, and that's the key differentiator vis-à-vis our peers, and that's what we focused on.
And as you know, we've said this many times on this call, if anything, we are focused even more on the
premiumness of the portfolio. The new Card Members – because you're talking about vintages, new Card
Members we're bringing in, 70% of those consumer Card Members are joining the franchise on a fee-paying
product. That's a big statement to join the franchise. And so, that's what we use to start projecting out.
There's still – as I've said before, there's still a little bit of COVID noise and normalization going on, but we are
very pleased with our credit performance that we're seeing. And as you pointed out, the gap versus competitors, if
anything, is increasing further.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, FTP Securities LLC
Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats, Kerri and Kartik, on your new roles. The net
interest yield on Card Member loans saw a nice improvement in the quarter, up 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter
and you're now above Q4 2019. And while I understand what rates are doing, the increase was pretty substantial
this quarter, so I was – versus prior quarters. So, I was wondering how we should expect that to trend. And
secondly, given your visibility due to the accounting treatment of card fees, how should we expect that to trend
over the coming quarters considering it's decelerated for several quarters in a row? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, yeah. So, on the yield, the key thing here – there are many moving parts, right? There are – as you know,
in terms of the funding, in terms of their pricing, in terms of their – there is vintages, but the key, the biggest
element that is driving that small increase in the yield is the revolve rate. So, the share -the revolving balances,
15


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
the interest-bearing balances in our total loan balances is increasing a little bit, and that's an outcome of our
tenured Card Members rebuilding their balances, which is something we've called out for several quarters now.
And I just want to point out again that most of that growth is coming from – most of that growth, i.e., 70%, is
coming from tenured Card Members that we know well and we can underwrite well. So, that's the key driver
behind the yield improvement.
When it comes to card fees, you're right, we have good visibility, because we amortize those fees over 12
months. So, we see that trend, so you should expect that trend to continue a little bit, i.e., the growth rate to
moderate. As I said, a key driver to this is going to be the cycle of product refreshes, and it's also going to be a
function of us investing more marketing dollars, bringing on more fee paying Card Members, and that dynamic is
just going to play out.
So, you should expect in the next few quarters a bit of a moderation there. But I need to call out that it's a
moderation from a very high level, and as we used to say on this call, even during the pandemic, that specific
category was still growing. So, it's still going to grow strongly in double-digit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Right. And if you go back to the pandemic, we were growing in the 10% to 11%, and so when you look at the
outsized – let's call it the growth rates that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2022, you had not acquired cards really in
2020. And so when you got to that amortization in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, it was lower, so the growth
rate was a little bit higher as we got in there. But look, we're pretty happy with 19% growth rate over numbers that
continue to get bigger.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in here. And congratulations to Christophe, Kerri, and
Kartik. I wanted to maybe switch from talking about the card products that the whole call has been talking about a
little bit. And maybe just talk a little bit about the non-card products. I think other loans and receivables is now
over $10 billion in total now. It's, obviously, been an area where you've spent a lot of time investing in. Maybe just
talk a little bit about that, both on the consumer and commercial side, where are you seeing some of the strongest
growth, how do you expect that to trend, how much is that contributing to interest yields and etcetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, let me sort of just HIT from a strategic perspective of what we're trying to do, and even at $10 billion it's
still a relatively small piece. One of the things we're trying to do from a small business perspective is to make sure
that we can provide a variety of working capital needs to our small business customers. And in that case, it can be
non-card loans for working capital, it can be shorter-term loans for up to two years or so forth.
And I think part of that was the overall Kabbage acquisition that we did to be able to do that, because what we
wanted to do – and it goes along with what we did with sort of our checking account as well, is we wanted to
make sure that we could provide for small businesses a host of products and services from having a check – a
transaction account, having a lending product, having a charge product, and then having working capital loans.
And so I think that really fits in, but that's not the driver of growth for us in that segment.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
From a consumer perspective, what we've continued to try to do is to really grow our organic footprint with our
consumers. And you can go back in history, it started as a charge card, and then we put lending, and then we put
pay over time, and plan it within the product and came up with a savings account and a debit product, and also a
small component of personal loans. And so, we've been judicious and careful about how we've gone about that.
But I think it's an important add to make sure that our customers are not going to our competitors when they need
products and services like that. So, that's the sort of strategic sort of backdrop on why we have that.
