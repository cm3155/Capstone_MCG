Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our third quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Our approach to both our colleagues and
customers continues to be grounded in our purpose. Our colleagues again demonstrated that we make people's
lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities we serve.
Now, on to slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, Huntington is
extraordinarily well positioned to manage through the evolving landscape for banks. The near-term environment
includes higher for longer interest rates, an uncertain economic outlook, expected new capital regulations, as well
as heightened regulatory requirements.
Huntington operates in this dynamic period from a position of substantial strength. Our balance sheet and risk
profile were intentionally built over more than a decade, explicitly for these times. Our market position, digital
leadership and momentum and core growth strategies put us in the top of the peer set. We intend to lean into this
position of strength to drive incremental growth through existing and new capabilities. Second, we've managed
top quartile CET1 inclusive of AOCI. We will continue to drive additional capital expansion for the remainder of
this year and over the course of 2024. Third, we benefit from a cultivated, granular deposit franchise and have
delivered consistent core deposit growth. Our balance deposit base forms the foundation of our robust liquidity
framework and has been a driving factor in our well-managed beta over the rate cycle today.

Fourth, credit quality remains strong across our portfolios, driven by our disciplined customer selection,
underwriting, and rigorous portfolio management. This approach is unwavering, starting with our tone at the top
as we maintain our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategy. We are executing with discipline while expanding with
existing and new capabilities to support our long-term growth. And very importantly, we are remaining steadfast in
our commitment to drive operating efficiency over time with continued execution of proactive expense
management programs. We expect the level of uncertainty in the near-term and some level of higher expenses to
manage through the realities of the current operating environment. However, these investments will also be
accompanied by sustained revenue growth, and the net result will be a Huntington that continues to be a strong
regional bank with significant growth opportunities ahead.
I will move on to slide 5 to further illustrate our position of strength. Our adjusted CET1 ratio is strong and near the
top of the peer group. We intend to drive this ratio higher throughout this year and 2024. This plan extends our
position of strength, supports continued execution of core growth strategies, and puts us well ahead of the
proposed Basel III endgame and other requirements.
Deposit growth has also outperformed our peers by nearly 10 percentage points since the end of 2021. We built
one of the most granular deposit bases with a leading insured deposit percentage, and we continue to drive the
expansion of primary bank customer relationships. Our liquidity is best in class for coverage of uninsured
deposits, representing nearly twice the level of peers. And we already meet the liquidity coverage ratio on an
unmodified basis. Credit metrics are also a differentiator for Huntington, with top quartile net charge-offs
compared to peers, and our credit reserves are top tier. Our management team has a long track record of
disciplined execution. For example, we were recently named the number one SBA lender nationally for the sixth
consecutive year. And we continue to expand the reach of this business and our support of access to capital for
small businesses.
Interest rates continue on a path towards the higher for longer scenario, which we've been anticipating for some
time. As rates remain higher, the potential for economic activity to be negatively impacted has increased.
However, thus far in the cycle, overall, our customers are effectively managing through it. We remain highly
vigilant and are proactively managing all loan portfolios. Our top tier credit reserves and expanding capital support
our approach to be front footed, to take advantage of opportunities to new customers and grow our businesses.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.35 and adjusted EPS of $0.36. The quarter included $15 million of
notable items which impacted EPS by $0.01 per common share. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE
came in at 19.5% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 20%. Further adjusting for AOCI,
underlying ROTCE was 15.3%.
Average deposits grew during the quarter, increasing by $2.6 billion or 1.8%. Loan balances decreased by $561
million or one-half of 1% from Q2, driven both by seasonality and our continued optimization. Net interest income
on a dollar basis expanded quarter-over-quarter, driven by a rising net interest margin. We continue to proactively
manage expenses and have begun a new set of incremental actions in the third quarter including branch
consolidation, staffing efficiencies, and corporate real estate consolidations. These actions, coupled with our

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
ongoing long-term efficiency programs as well as the measures we implemented in Q1 of this year, will help us
drive rigorous baseline expense efficiency while sustaining capacity for investments in the franchise. Credit quality
remains strong, with net charge-offs of 24 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.96%. Return on capital
was robust, driving capital accretion with reported CET1 now above 10%.
Turning to slide 7. As I noted, average loan balances decreased one-half of 1% from Q2, driven primarily by lower
commercial loan balances which decreased by $1.2 billion or 1.7% from the prior quarter. On a year-over-year
basis, average loans increased 3.3%, reflective of our intentional optimization efforts. Primary components of the
commercial loan change included CRE balances, which declined by $387 million driven by pay downs, distribution
finance decreased $434 million due to normal seasonality with lower dealer inventory levels in the third quarter
before the expected inventory build in the fourth quarter. Asset finance decreased by $271 million. Auto floorplan
increased by $122 million. All other commercial categories net decreased as we continue to drive optimization
towards the highest returns. In consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage and RV/Marine, while auto loan
balances declined for the quarter.
Turning to slide 8. As noted, we continued to deliver consistent deposit growth in the quarter. Average deposits
increased by $2.6 billion or 1.8% from the prior quarter. Turning to slide 9. We saw sustained growth in deposit
balances in the third quarter, including sequential increases during July, August, and September. Continuing the
trend we have seen previously. Importantly, core deposits represented the entirety of the deposit growth for the
quarter, with broker deposits declining quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to slide 10. Non-interest bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast with the deceleration
of sequential changes that we would expect at this point in the rate cycle. The non-interest bearing percentage
decreased by 120 basis points from the second quarter, and we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and
stabilize during 2024.
Onto slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $22 million or 1.6% to $1,379 million, driven by
expanded net interest margin. We continued to benefit from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins
that has occurred throughout the cycle, with net interest income growing at 9% CAGR over the past two years.
Reconciling the change in NIM from Q2, we saw an increase of 9 basis points on a GAAP basis and an increase
of 10 basis points on a core basis excluding accretion. The drivers of the higher NIM quarter-over-quarter were
higher spread net of free funds, lower fed cash balances versus the prior quarter and higher FHLB stock
dividends in the quarter.
Interest rates rose during the quarter, particularly at the longer-end. And as we expected, that drove a net benefit
to NIM. In addition, our optimization efforts across both loan growth and funding mix continue to perform very well.
These factors resulted in the margin coming in better than we had expected when we shared our outlook in July.
We continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and guidance
continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the low end by the forward yield curve, and at
the high end by a scenario that projects rates stay higher for longer.
The higher for longer scenario today assumes one additional rate increase in 2023. Flat Fed funds through
October of 2024 and ends 2024, approximately 75 basis points higher than the forward curve. With the move in
rates higher, we now anticipate net interest margin for the fourth quarter to be around 305 basis points to 310
basis points. This is 5 basis points to 10 basis points higher than the level we shared previously. Looking further
out, our modeling continues to indicate 2024 NIM trending flat to higher from the Q4 2023 endpoint.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Turning to slide 12, our cumulative deposit beta through Q3 was 37%, up 5 percentage points from the prior
quarter, tracking closely to our expectations. Sequential increases in beta are slowing quarter-over-quarter as we
have forecasted as the interest rate cycle nears or hits its peak.
As we have noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle
in terms of the level and timing of the peak, the duration of any extended pause before a decrease. Given the
outlooks for possibly a higher peak and very likely a more extended pause and was the case three months ago,
our current outlook for deposit beta is to trend a few percentage points higher than our prior guidance of 40%. We
will have to see how the rate environment plays out into 2024 to know with certainty. What is critical, in our view,
is to ensure we continue to manage both deposit and loan pricing exceptionally rigorously, drive asset yields
higher, deliver solid incremental returns, and deliver a better overall NIM from the higher for longer rate
environment as a result.
Turning to slide 13 and expanding on my point on loan yields. The construct of our balance sheet is approximately
half fully variable rate, 10% indirect auto, which is a shorter approximately two-year duration fixed product, 10% in
ARMs with a five-year duration, and the remainder of approximately 30% is longer durated fixed. This mix
contributes to the asset sensitivity of our overall balance sheet and has helped us to benefit significantly from the
current rate cycle. We are seeing solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yields. Given the higher for longer rate
environment, we expect to continue to benefit from this fixed asset repricing going forward, supporting the higher
NIM outlook.
Turning to slide 14. Our level of cash and securities was down slightly from the prior quarter as we lowered some
of the elevated cash we've been holding in Q2. During Q3, we did not reinvest securities cash flows, and the
securities balance moved modestly lower as proceeds were held in cash given the attractive short-term rates.
We're managing the duration of the portfolio lower, continuing our management approach since 2021.
Turning to slide 15. Our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $91 billion and has grown
quarter-over-quarter. At quarter-end, this pool of available liquidity represented 204% of total uninsured deposits
appear leading coverage.
Turning to slide 16, we continued to be dynamic in adding to our hedging program during the quarter. Our
objectives remain two-fold, to protect capital and upgrade scenarios and to protect NIM in down rate scenarios.
The most substantive increase was in addition to our forward starting pay fixed swaption strategy, which
increased by $5.9 billion during the quarter to $15.5 billion total. This program is intended to protect capital from
tail risk in substantive up rate scenarios and once again benefited us as rates moved higher in the quarter. We
also added $2 billion in collars to support our NIM against longer-term down rate scenarios.
Moving on to slide 17. GAAP non-interest income increased by $14 million or 2.8% to $509 million for the third
quarter. Excluding the mark-to-market on the pay fixed swaptions, fees were relatively stable quarter-over-
quarter. On an underlying basis compared to the second quarter, we saw increases in deposit service charges,
including higher payment-related treasury management fees. This growth was largely offset by lower capital
markets fees.
Moving on to slide 18. We're seeing encouraging and sustained underlying trends across our three areas of
strategic focus for fee revenue growth. Capital markets, which has grown by a 19% CAGR over the past six
years, benefits from a broad set of capabilities bolstered by Capstone. While 2023 has certainly been a
challenging environment for capital markets activities, in both advisory and several credit-driven products.

Forward pipelines within advisory are solid and we continue to foresee this as a primary contributor to fee revenue
growth over the moderate term.
Our payments businesses represent one of the biggest opportunities for both relationship deepening and revenue
growth across both treasury management and card categories. In wealth management, we see a great
opportunity to increase the penetration of the offering across our customers, leveraging our number one ranking
for trust as we grow advisory relationships and drive higher managed assets with recurring revenue streams.
Moving on to slide 19, on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense increased by $40 million and underlying core
expenses increased by $25 million. As I mentioned, we incurred $15 million of notable item expenses related to
the staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding these items, core expense
growth compared to the prior quarter was driven by higher personnel, occupancy, professional services, and a set
of smaller items within all other expenses. We have taken proactive actions throughout the year to support the low
level of core underlying expense growth we have delivered.
In the first half of the year, we executed on the voluntary retirement program, organizational realignment, moving
from four revenue segments to two, and 31 branch consolidations. Now, in the third quarter, we're taking another
set of incremental actions. We are accelerating the implementation of our business process offshoring program
and we're creating efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of prioritizing resources toward the
largest growth opportunities in the near-term. We're also driving incremental saves in our corporate real estate
footprint, as well as implementing another set of branch consolidations with 34 planned closures early next year.
These actions demonstrate our commitment to disciplined expense management and will support the continued
investment into critical areas of the company to drive long-term value.
As we manage expenses, we're balancing both short-term investment and revenue growth with the longer-term
opportunities we know are in front of us. Slide 20 recaps our capital position. Reported common equity Tier 1
increased to 10.1%, and has increased sequentially for four quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1
resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 8%. Our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital, while
maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We're actively managing adjusted CET1 inclusive of
AOCI and expect to drive that ratio higher over the course of 2024.
On slide 21, credit quality continues to perform very well, with normalization of metrics consistent with our
expectations. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 24 basis points for the quarter and, while higher than last
quarter by 8 basis points, are tracking to our guidance for full year net charge-offs between 20 basis points and 30
basis points. This level continues to be at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net charge-offs of
25 basis points to 45 basis points. As previously guided, given ongoing normalization, non-performing assets
increased from the previous quarter, and the criticized asset ratio increased with risk rating changes within
commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses is higher by 3 basis points to
1.96% of total loans, and our ECL coverage ratio is amongst the highest in our peer group.
Let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter on slide 22. We forecast loan growth of approximately 1% in the
fourth quarter, which would put full year loan growth at approximately 5%, matching the lower end of our prior
range. Deposits are likewise expected to grow in the fourth quarter by approximately 1%. Core net interest
income for the fourth quarter is expected to decline between 4% and 5% from Q3 before expanding throughout
2024 from that level. Non-interest income on a core underlying basis is expected to be relatively stable. Expenses
are expected to increase between 4% and 5% into the fourth quarter, primarily driven by revenue-related
expenses associated with the expected growth in capital markets, a seasonal increase in medical claims, and
7

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
sustained investment in new and enhanced capabilities. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near the
midpoint of the 20 basis points to 30 basis points guidance range.
Finally, let me close on slide 23 with a few thoughts on our management priorities for 2024. We're still finalizing
our budget for next year. And as always, we look to share more specific guidance during our January earnings
call. First and foremost, we're committed to driving continued capital expansion while we continue to optimize
lending growth to drive the highest returns. As Steve mentioned, we're playing from a position of strength and we
expect to maintain that position as we get ahead of proposed capital regulations and phase-in periods. Related to
deposits, we're continuing to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. This should result in
continued growth of deposits into next year, while supporting our disciplined management of deposit beta.
Given the expected higher for longer rate scenario, we will continue to position the balance sheet to remain
modestly asset sensitive, which will support the margin and we expect will deliver growth and net interest income
dollars on a full year basis. Non-interest income remains a critical focus for us, with sustained execution on three
primary strategic areas for fee revenue growth; capital markets, payments and wealth management. Over the
medium-term, we expect that non-interest income has the potential to grow at a rate more quickly than both loans
and spread revenues, given the opportunities for these fee businesses.
As I mentioned, on expenses, we have taken considerable actions to hold baseline expense growth to a low level.
This focused on sustained efficiencies, including Operation Accelerate, business process offshoring, and the
other actions will yield multiyear benefits. These actions are necessary to allow for the continued investment into
new and enhanced capabilities, which will set up growth over the course of the next few years. We expect the net
result of these actions for 2024 will be an underlying growth rate of core expenses somewhat higher than the level
we saw in 2023. Our current working estimate is underlying expense growth of approximately 4% compared to the
approximately 2.5% level we were running in 2023. We believe this level of expense management is the right
balance to position the company to operate within the current environment and sustain our momentum into 2025.
We will also maintain our rigorous approach to credit management consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low
risk appetite.
Finally, to close, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to proactively stay ahead of the evolving
environment. We will be dynamic and address these numerous topics head on. And over time, we believe this will
result in opportunities to benefit substantially in the coming years.
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hi, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Can you talk about the puts and takes in that 4% expense growth number for next year? What sort of revenue
environment is that baked in? What are the areas that are pushing up expenses and maybe also where you have
flexibility to manage more if the revenue environment is weaker?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. And this is Zach. I'll take that one. Just to [indiscernible] (00:24:16) and set a framework for
the answer, let me reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks just a minute ago which is driving efficiency in our
core expenses is a key priority for us. We're one of the most efficient banks in the regional banking space, and
that's been a product of years of efforts. I mean what we're trying to do right now is strike the balance of the short-
term and the medium-term. In the short-term, managing expenses to a low level of growth given the overall
revenue environment. But also in the medium-term, we see significant growth opportunities over time for
Huntington. And we want to make sure that we can maintain that the momentum in our key strategies and in fact
capture the higher revenue outlook that we just shared.
Even as we quickly get ahead and stress that work quickly get ahead of the new and expanded risk management
capabilities that we need to operate. If you take a step back, it was just over a year ago that we were fully
delivering over $0.5 billion of annual expenses from the TCF merger. Over the last year, since then, we felt
underlying core expenses to 2.4%, and we did that with all the programs I've just talked about in prepared
remarks, the long-term efficiency programs, the proactive actions we took in the first quarter of this year. And
now, a new set of actions that we're implementing in the third quarter including another tranche of branch
optimization, accelerating the business process offshoring, driving efficiencies across the bank, and finding
efficiencies in our core real estate portfolio.
And as we look at the 2024, to your question, we're seeing the opportunity for incremental revenue upside,
particularly in the really strong performance we've seen in our NIM management program, which is higher than
our prior outlook and good momentum in the key businesses as we look forward.

We want to quickly address the lessons learned from the last year's environment address the new regulations
coming around Basel, CCAR, resolution planning, and ultimately enhance our risk management, so we can
operate in – from a position of strength just as we are right now going forward, which will require investment. So,
the kind of things that are driving at roughly 1.5% higher run rate, our investment into teams like treasury, risk
management, technology is where they are focused on enhancing data, underlying process capabilities and
automation.
The goal, we'll take a step back, is to get ahead of these requirements, to quickly move through this period. We
expect to see around a year's worth of this higher expected run rate expenses to get around 1.5% higher. And
then, that expense growth rate will come back down again as we exit 2024 and we'll see the underlying core
expense management come through. It all goes back to the goal of maintaining our [indiscernible] (00:27:14), our
momentum, and really ensuring that Huntington continues to be in a position of strength to go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And this is Steve. Just to sort of coming over the top of that, we think this is the time to be dynamic, to play off us,
to be front footed in terms of the number of other businesses. And we intend to do that and that will require
investment. We'll have more colleagues, more talent, if you will. We'll have some new capabilities. All of which are
in the plan and the numbers Zach shared with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, just putting it together because you mentioned you're modelling NII trends higher as you go
through 2024. There is more upside to see. How does that play into operating leverage for next year? Do you still
think you can drive positive operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It's a little [indiscernible] (00:28:09) precise guidance on that. But driving toward operating leverage over time is a
key element of our goals. You'll remember that it's one of the three major financial targets we've set for ourselves.
And we do see a solid opportunity for revenue growth next year on both spread and fees. But I would stress,
again, coming back, what's critical for us is managing for the medium term at this point. And we want to make
sure that we can maintain those critical investments even as we're driving the efficiency during the underlying
expense growth rate. Talk about our operating leverage over time, we will have some part of the plan and we'll
have to see the precise outlook for 2024 [indiscernible] (00:28:47).

Just on the net interest income front, I know you indicated that you implied a – you expect a trough in the fourth
quarter and then expanding through 2024. Maybe can you help us frame the magnitude of growth that you think is
achievable under the current curve assumption as you look at the NII upside? And then I guess the same
question would be for your commentary around the margin in terms of expansion through the year. Maybe if you
can help us size that up in terms of what's a fair assumption based on what you're looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. This is Zach. I'll take that one. Now, I think just to take a step back, and we saw in
the third quarter really highlighted the effectiveness of our overall asset sensitivity management program where
we saw NIM expand and the benefits of after repricing really coming through into a stronger NIM. What we saw in
the third quarter was about 10 basis points increase in NIM from the second quarter. Around half of that, I will
note are items that were temporary in nature, reducing Fed cash in Q3 from Q2 to around 3 basis points. We've
got some elevated levels of dividend from the FHLB stock. That was a function of Q2 FHLB borrowing. Those
items won't recur. However, we did see a positive 4 basis point move in underlying spread in the third quarter, as I
noted.
As we think about Q4, our expectation is that we'll see a NIM of between 305 and 310 basis points, which is
around 5 or 10 basis points better than I would have thought this time last quarter and it's really driven by the
benefits we're seeing coming through from the higher for longer rate scenario, which as we've noted, we would
expect to be accretive to overall NIM and that is bearing fruit.
Based on the trend we're seeing in earning assets, I expect dollars NII in Q4 to be down around 4% to 5% from
Q3 and forming a trough both in NIM ratio and in net interest income of dollars in the fourth quarter and trending
higher from there. The NIM outlook for 2024, I expect to be flat to rising, as I noted. And I think the things you're
going to see are continued, really solid progress on a fixed asset repricing. Major asset categories on the fixed
side this quarter is seeing again sequential increases into Q3, expect to see that continuing on. Particularly in the
higher for longer scenario. Even as we do see beta continuing to trend as well, it'll be accretive to overall spread
throughout the course of next year, we think.
We'll also benefit, as we've noted before, during 2024 from a gradual reduction in the negative carry from the
received fixed swap hedge portfolio. We estimate roughly 5 basis points throughout the course of next year on
that benefit mainly in the second half of the year. So, as there are couple of that flat to rising NIM with growth in
11

loans, growth in the assets that as I know will drive overall NII dollar is higher. We'll get more precise with
guidance as we get into January, but those are the major drivers that we're seeing at this point.

Very helpful, Zach. Thank you for that. And then separately on credit, criticized loans up 17% linked quarter. It
looks like and I believe you alluded to it in your comments, a lot of that was commercial real estate. Can you –
and I know you added to your reserve and commercial real estate non-performers are also up pretty sharply. Was
there a dedicated effort to scrub the portfolio that you were working through your exposures there that drove a
lumpier move here or is this the deterioration that's starting to take shape as we all stacked in this sector.

Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, John. This is Rich. Let me start with that, and then I can turn it over to Brendan to give you a little bit more
color on what happened in the third quarter. So, if you think back in Q2, our NPA level was at 46 basis points,
which was the lowest level we've had since the GFC, and we've had eight consecutive quarters of declines
totaling over $450 million, since that. The Q3 level that we're at today, 52 basis points is right around where we
were this time last year. So, to me, it's not at a level that's concerning to your point around being proactive. We
have been – a lot of the ads to non-accrual that we had in the quarter were discretionary. We have about two-
thirds of our commercial NPLs are current on their principal and interest.
The CRE class is a similar story. We had reductions in five of the six previous quarters. And as you talk about
credit normalizing, you would expect to see an increase in CRE class on front of that. So, I wouldn't categorize the
movements as huge jumps. I think it's just a normalization of very low levels for us. But, Brendan, why don't you
give a little bit of insight into the Q3 specifics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Lawlor A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Credit Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Rich. To provide just a little bit more color, approximately for CRE class, approximately 60% of the
increase was focused in commercial real estate and our ABL group. There are two places you expect to see
higher levels. On the NPA side, it was split more equally between commercial real estate and C&I. For both NPA
and CRE class, as you noted, the real estate exposure was focused mostly in office. And on the C&I side, beyond
the ABL concentration I mentioned, there really weren't material concentration. So, I think what you're seeing in
the numbers, as Rich said, is just bounce off the very low bottom.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, just maybe a question for you, Steve. I think I mean you all have talked about being front-footed. There are
banks that are talking about coming back to loan growth next year. But I'm just wondering if there's going to be a
ton of loan demand to speak of for banks to lend into. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing across
your footprint, where that loan demand is coming from, or are you seeing customers get increasingly cautious?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, great questions. Thank you. I believe there is a growing cautiousness, what's going on in Israel and the
Middle East, what's going on in Washington. We've got a UAW strike that does not have an apparent resolution.
And I think businesses are reacting to that. 99% of our customer base are privately owned companies. Rates are
up. They're using their liquidity but the uncertain economic outlook and where rates are going, all sort of are
headwinds to the next round of growth.
Having said that, our businesses are doing well. We'll have good growth. We'll be within the guidance that we
gave you that Zach gave you earlier in the – will be up about 5% year-over-year. And we'll continue to see growth
next year, I believe, in a couple of areas, in particular.
Our distribution finance is a powerful engine. It seasonally reduced this quarter. It will be up net – in the fourth
quarter and we expect to continue to growth that by winning new business. We are a significant equipment
finance lender. And more and more onshoring, more automation, there will be continued demand albeit probably
not at the levels we saw in 2022 and before, that will play well. And we're top 10 asset based lender. So, all of
those asset-related finance activities should do well in this environment. And as you know, we are a huge small
business spend. Small businesses will need more support and we'll be there for them. And those will be sources
of growth. But there's an overall more cautious outlook within our customer base just that we'll have some
moderate impact on – I think on overall loan demand next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And I guess a follow-up, Zach, you mentioned solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yields
as they reprice. Just talk to us in terms of when these are coming up for repricing. Is it just kind of playing out
contractually? Is there some negotiation in terms of the spreads narrowing at the time of repricing of these fixed
rate loans? And if that's kind of impacting credit trends, are some of these borrowers looking a bit worse in terms
of their ability to service the debt post-repricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great questions. Let me address those. So, what I say is in terms of the trajectory on asset yield, take it
back, over 200 basis points through the cycle to-date. And it's really been a couple of things, most notably the
intentional outcome that we've had in terms of how we're incrementally driving new loan production into – and
really driving for higher returns, which also is often higher [indiscernible] (00:38:46) so we're seeing that come

through in a lot of the areas where we're actively modulating and optimizing indirect auto, for example, is a great
example that fields up tremendously on the new portfolio course of the cycle.
It's also, though, just a natural outcome of the structure of the balance sheet. And one of the reasons why we
added the slide we did I think this quarter in terms of detail there was still just provide more transparency into that,
we're around 50% fully variable and so we're seeing the benefits of higher rates come through on that portfolio,
another roughly 10% in shorter durated fixed indirect auto. As I just noted, we're seeing – really excited of all the
increases in portfolio there. Another 10% in ARMs, five-year duration which we're gradually seeing that come
through. In the higher for longer scenario, every one of those fixed asset categories, including the longer durated
remaining third of the portfolio, are really staying dependent that we've seen. Just in Q3, 50 basis points increase
in the coupon yields across the portfolio, greater than 20 basis point increase in back book portfolio yields and I
do think that will continue to trend here, be one of the key drivers for NIM, the stability and growth as we go into
2024. We're not seeing any substantive portfolio-wide credit-driven yields and pricing assumptions. And really, it's
much more fundamentally driven as I noted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, just to add, we've got a very diversified portfolio. We've been very disciplined with our aggregate
moderate to risk appetite over the years you've seen us report quarterly since 2010 on the consumer book which
is super-prime and auto and resi, et cetera. So, we're sitting in a position we feel strengthening the confidence
and the portfolio and our ability to manage through even in a tougher cycle. And as we've said to our customer
base with that relationship orientation, we're here to support them and we will – we're positioned to do that with
our reserves, our capital, our robust liquidity. And that leads us to this stance of playing offense and moving share
during these next couple of years.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Hey. Zach, I just wanted to clarify if I heard correctly is on the NII. Are we expecting it to grow full year 2023 –
pardon me, full year 2024 over 2023 or just positively off the fourth quarter base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, Scott, great questions, happy to clarify both. Expect to see trajectory of growth out of the year and on a net
basis, full year growth as well, which is going to be a function of flat to rising NIMs and pretty comparable over our
full year and then year-on-year as well as growth in earning assets and loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that. And then wanted to kind of revisit the cost equation a bit, maybe on the
initiatives that you began in the third quarter. Maybe just some thoughts on how substantial they are. And I guess
ultimately, I guess the question becomes, we'll have about 4% expense growth despite these initiatives sort of
what cost growth might have been without them. So, just any sort of further thoughts on exactly where we're
investing, what this will ultimately end up driving, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Terrific question. I'll let [indiscernible] (00:42:38) expand on that. If I think about the equation that we're
managing in 2023, we've been seeing around 2%, 2.5% underlying expense growth, and that's with the benefit of
significant efficiencies that we're generating this year. I estimate that sort of around 1% benefit in expenses in
2023 from these cumulative initiatives going from last six to 18 months.
And self-funding underlying investments. We've talked about this model before, drive efficiencies in the core,
keeping the underlying core at a low level through the funnel, an outsized level of investment and expense growth
into key investment areas like tech. Marketing, new additions to personnel to support the strategies that those
underlying investments are up almost 20% in 2023, which is what I will call the competitive capabilities that we've
got. As we go into, that model, it's what drove the overall and roughly 2.5% growth that we saw in 2023. I think
what we're seeing as we go into 2024 is roughly similar sort of underlying expense management program. We will
be modulating down somewhat the underlying investments in light of the environment clearly. But also bearing
some modest incremental impacts of just the cumulative inflationary environment.
And the efficiencies will rise as well. And so, the net kind of underlying run rate that I would have expected into
next year was around 2.5%. And then on top of that, we are accelerating – again these investments in regulatory
response, risk management capabilities that represent the additional 1.5% expense as we go into next year.
That's the 4% trajectory.
If I think about where we're investing, [indiscernible] (00:44:35) touch on this briefly, continue to focus on core
strategy investments, delivering the TCF revenue synergies, growing our commercial base through vertical,
specialty – specialized – specialties, expertise, digital and product development in our consumer banking and
business banking division. Continue to drive the fee revenue strategies in capital markets, payments and wealth,
and then on top of that, clearly dealing with these additional areas around Basel III, CCAR, liquidity and interest
rate risk management, resolution planning and data [indiscernible] (00:45:12).

[indiscernible] (00:45:16) just to add on, you'll also see several new initiatives that are also included in that
number of 4% that we'll be announcing Q4 and Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And I guess just one final ticky-tack question. The fourth quarter cost increase, will that include any
unusual charges the way we saw this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, we saw around $15 million of onetime costs this quarter. Some portion of onetime costs that we expected to
arise as a result of the new initiatives were taking place were not able to be accounted for within the third quarter.
I'm expecting roughly $10 million additional onetime expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the same initiatives
that's not included in the guidance that I gave earlier [indiscernible] (00:46:14) of things. So, the total one-timers
really for those actions I expect to be approximately $25 million in total, of which again we've taken $15 million
[indiscernible] (00:46:23).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

So, just circling back on capital, obviously strong, really any ratio you look at and including AOCI. And I
understand the logic of building capital from here given uncertain macro and you're kind of [indiscernible]
(00:46:51) the business. But is there a level that you're like, once we get here, it's just more than we need under
almost any scenario and you'd [indiscernible] (00:47:01) to deploy it more aggressively?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. It's a great question. Let me take a minute to expand on that. As you know, driving capital higher from here is
a key focus. We have fully transitioned within the company to managing the primary metric of adjusted CET1
inclusive of AOCI. And on that basis, we're at 8% in the third quarter. Our operating range for CET1 is between
9% and 10%. And so, we want to drive that 8% ratio up into that operating range of between 9% and 10%, and
that's the key goal. I think by the time we get there, I expect that we have significant confidence in being able to
16


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
do that by the way over time. By the time we get there, presumably, we'll have clarity on the final Basel III
requirements, any other implications to capital coming out of the new regulatory environment, and we'll be able to
also reassess where the macro environment is and where the lending trajectory. So, [indiscernible] (00:48:09).
And so, hard to [indiscernible] (00:48:11) sort of exactly where within that range we want to go, but my
expectation is once we get into that range, there'll be an opportunity to get back to a more normalized capital
distribution model, support elevated and a longer-term run rate levels of loan growth that we've seen in the past
and move through it. I'll just tack on our current working hypothesis and modeling estimate around the Basel III
proposal which was adopted exactly as was proposed. There's roughly 5% increase in RWA, based the phase-in
schedule that was proposed as part of the NPR. That wouldn't be phased in until 2027, and would represent
about 40 bps of CET1 in 2027 again as that proposal is written. And so, part of this is just quickly get ahead of
that, even far out in time [indiscernible] (00:49:07) far out of time and that really is and allow us to move forward
on front foot starting 2025 and beyond from an accelerated loan growth perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. That was helpful. And then just quickly squeeze in the mark-to-market impact of the paycheck swaptions.
Maybe it's a silly question, but we just kind of put in some gains when rates go up and then if rates go the other
way, is it mark-to-market on the negative side or how should we think about modeling that and the drivers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Let me expand on that and I'll [indiscernible] (00:49:44) question. The strategy of those instruments was to
protect capital against really substantive operating scenarios. When we purchased them, they were roughly 200
basis points out of the money. We've got about a nine to 12 months of forward life. And they would be designed to
protect, a third to maybe as much as 45% of the securities value of risk in those really substantive about 200 to
300 basis point shock scenarios. I think that you put a lot of them on early in the second quarter. We added to that
portfolio early in the third quarter. And we've seen – we've spent roughly $30 million in premium [indiscernible]
(00:50:28) service. In our view, a pretty small insurance policy for a very significant benefit in those shock
scenarios.
What we've seen thus far is gains. We saw $18 million of gain in Q2, a $33 million of gain in Q3, and a $51 million
cumulative gain. I'll tell you if you were to strike them, right now, you see another gain into the fourth quarter, but
clearly they get [indiscernible] (00:50:53) at the very end of the quarter. The answer is yes, in the near-term, if
rates rise, you would see a gain in them. If rates fall, you would see a loss in them.
The key thought process for us is how critical is that insurance policy to continue to maintain. And so, versus the
gain in them. If we continue to hold them, I would expect that over time, they would expire unused and out-of-the-
money. And you would see that gain run back through as a negative through fee income, if they [indiscernible]
(00:51:27) close it out. And we will be dynamic and continue to watch the interest rate outlook with a primary
focus on protection of capital. At this point, again, pretty di minimis cash outlay for a really strong insurance policy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning. Steve, I know you talked about, generally a little bit of softening demand out there. But one, I
wanted to ask to ask you on your auto business, I did notice that your originations were up. And obviously, a lot of
peers have pulled away from this business. And it's a business that you guys have been historically very strong in
and now has really good incremental yield. Just wondering if that's an on opportunity set and have you kind of –
how do you think through reengaging there as one of those potential growth engines especially as you're
[indiscernible] (00:52:27) been able to show that deposit stability? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, great question. And auto has performed very, very well for us. We have a confidence in its credit and
spreads are very attractive. It's a cyclical product. And in the past, we've – when spreads have widened, we've
chosen to do a bit more. We'll be dynamic as we look at this as the interest rate environment clarifies. And I think
it's a short, you know, it's a relatively short asset. It's roughly a two-year average duration. So, we like this asset
class a lot and we certainly like it counter cyclically. And that'll be something we'll be looking at closely as we go
through to 2024 and 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then last thing, Zach, just looking at, what you moved around a little bit on the swaps portfolio.
So, can you just kind of walk us through some of your decision trees with regards to this, this quarter's
terminations and locking in here and any anticipated future activity you're thinking about in terms of just the book
as it stands and going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I will tell you, this is a very dynamic and active discussion. It's a weekly pretty
rigorous data analysis process that we do. And it's always focused on two key strategies. Protecting capital
against upgrade scenarios and protecting NIM against downgrade scenarios. As I noted in the prior question
around the pay fix swaptions. We did have during the quarter to that anticipating that the rates have the strong
potential of moving higher and want to protect capital against that. And we did a rate in fact [indiscernible]
(00:54:08) as you saw clearly. And so, that benefited us there. But what's interesting as well is that the curve has
steepened, the longer it has come up and as much as it has.
The opportunity to optimize and take incremental downgrade hedging opportunities in a more efficient manner
with less upfront negative carry is increasing. I would say as it relates to that, our view is still lagging into it, no big
bets, and we're seeing very significant benefits that come through in the base asset sensitivity, clearly. But over
the longer-term, think of it as a 2025, 2026, 2027. We certainly want to protect those revenue streams. And we'll
18


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
be seeking opportunities to increase downgrade hedging here if the environment continues to be what it is. In the
meantime, it's more of an optimization, I would say.
You saw us exit some receive fixed swaps in Q3. Those were mainly shorter durations, less efficient structures by
[indiscernible] (00:55:10) increased capacity to re-up for longer structures. We entered in some collars, which
would give us the option for down rate hedging if rates are attractive out of the future. And I do suspect that
there'll be more of that down rate hedging opportunity as I know – like you know as we go [indiscernible]
(00:55:31) next year if the curve continues to be the way it should have done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And is there a way of kind of just putting all that together in terms of like the net impact of the swaps book,
on your net NII, and is that getting better going forward or worse? Can you just kind of help us put it in context, if
you can?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. That's a great question. So, just zooming into 2024 for a second, based on the swaps we've got in the
portfolio today, I do expect we're seeing roughly a 15 basis point to 17 basis point drag in currency NIM. It was 15
bps in Q3, expected to be roughly 17 bps of drag in Q4 of 2023 from the overall swaps coming through NIM.
As I noted, one of the earlier questions in this hour, by 2024, I expect that to reduce by about 5 bps, particularly
second half of the year when the curve starts to fall in the forecast. Yeah. So, that's probably the best way to
answer your question. In the end, the goal is to call it a NIM really just to support it in this type of range for years
to come.

Hey, Richard, Brendan, what – what's the message you want to send us on the outlook for provision and
reserves? I mean it feels like you feel fine on credit. But I'm curious if you feel you need to build reserves and how
you want us to think about provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Let me start with kind of where we are in the quarter. We went up by 3 basis points, our coverage ratio.
There's really a 1% dollar increase. We went up $26 million, and we put most of that into the commercial real
estate reserve just given the uncertainty that we got there. Where we go from here. I mean we don't get specific
guidance around the coverage ratio, particularly around the provision. But, it's going to depend on where the
economy goes to the extent that we see further weakening, or reevaluate it. But I would imagine that any builds
from here would be similar to what you would see in the third quarter, fairly nominal from a dollar standpoint. It
may be moving some things around. But in general, we feel really good about where the reserve is right now. And
as we get to the other side of this and the economic outlook starts to improve, I could see us bringing the
coverage ratio back down into that 1.60 range over time. So, we'll look at it every quarter, Jon, and but we feel
good about the 1.96 right now.

Yeah. Okay. Late in the call, Steve, but just a bigger picture question for you. You had a good quarter, but when I
saw the guide and – for the fourth quarter for lower NII and higher expenses, and then, heard the expense guide
for 2024, it kind of pulled back some of that optimism. I guess my bigger and I think you understand that, but my
bigger picture question is what's the message for 2024? Is that – is it a year of investment and you're not going to
push revenue growth or are we just all being a little bit too pessimistic here and just focusing on the expenses and
some of the near-term NII headwinds?

Zach also talked about improving net interest income and NIM at 2024. So, I don't think of that as and our outlook
is not of a negative nature. We're investing in the businesses. We're going to do a number of things that I think will
position us really well for the medium-term, like 2025, 2026. In terms of further growth, we'll have some new
capabilities and some additional talent in the company. We'll be in a position to manage with data and processes
even better as we go forward. We're accelerating some of our multi-year plans into 2024.
And as Zach said, that's the – that growth in outlook for expenses in 2025 comes back to a more normal level. So,
this is us being intentional, positioning the company to play OpEx. And we think we're in that position. We're
confident on our credit. We've got good and growing capital on both a gross and an adjusted basis. Liquidity is
exceptional. The deposit growth continues. And as you saw in 2010, for those who were out in that period of time,
there are moments to take advantage. And so, we launched Fair Play and as we did a number of things in

commercial bank and really opened up SBA lending, et cetera. We think this coming year is one of those
moments and we intend to play offense.

Okay. So, it's – okay. That's good. I had to ask it, Steve, I'm getting asked that question, but I just – I just needed
to know if you're optimistic or pessimistic for 2024. It sounds like you're...

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Steve, I've heard all the commentaries for the past hour on expenses. And I guess what I still don't understand is,
is the step-up in expense growth in 2024. Is that tied to you seeing a better revenue environment to absorb a
higher level of spend for something going on that's going to require you to spend more in 2024 agnostic for the
revenue environment [indiscernible] (01:01:40)?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
So, we're gearing the company to manage the growth dynamic that we expect will be in place in 2024 and
beyond. We also are accelerating certain multi-year investments into 2024, so that we're in an even better
position with data. And it's principally data to manage in managing company, right? We're at different scale now
post-GCF. We saw a lot of unique activity in March around Silicon Valley. Things move very quickly. We want – I
want and the board wants better data, better access to information that we have and pushing the button
[indiscernible] (01:02:32).
So, we're – we've been on a multi-year journey. We're going to pull that forward and position the company to be
even stronger. We've been managing market risk, as you've seen, with us hedging about half of our AFS portfolio
since 2019, but our processes have not been as automated as we would like them to be given the speed at which
things can change. And so, we said we will take advantage of lessons learned out of Silicon Valley and others in
this most recent episode that has resulted in us making a number of adjustments in our treasury and
[indiscernible] (01:03:13) policies that I think will prove to further bolster our aggregate moderates low risk
appetite and then these investments in data and some other areas in addition to the revenue area investments
will also position us to more effectively manage the company on a real-time basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. It will set the pace of investment. Is that a 2024 story or is that a 2024 and beyond story?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
But we're trying to pull things forward into 2024 as Zach said. And I think as we think about the 2025 and beyond,
we'll be back to more normalized. Again, this was an [indiscernible] (01:03:54) part, an overall view of trying to
take advantage of the environment that we see in 2024 and beyond and position the bank for growth.
I like what we did in [indiscernible] (01:04:14).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Well, it sounds like it's partially opportunistic and partially need to invest in systems. Right. Sounds like
that's a portion of this, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We had multiyear plans that we're accelerating. That's choice.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. If I could ask one last question. So, I don't know if it was Bryan of First Horizon recently was asked
about crossing $100 billion or you really don't want it cross organically. Right? You don't want to be $101 billion.
But you guys did $186 billion today. How do you see this with these proposed changes coming? You think you're
at a good spot at this level or do you think you need to boost size and scale too? Just given what just potentially
comes? Thanks.

We own the risk and risk management. We're going to maintain this aggregate moderate to low risk appetite
where we've done things well in the past, we'll continue to do them in the future. I think the size of the business is
not the only determinant. I think the business model itself is very, very important. Part of the strategy over time is
to be deep in certain markets where our consumer and regional bank giving us brand awareness and other
attributes that let us continue to grow the core. And then we've invested selectively in a variety of commercial
businesses, and our asset finance or equipment finance ABL, the distribution finance, a number of these
businesses that and beyond the specialty businesses that are national in nature, complemented by things that
we've added on the payments space last year. The acquisition of on the investment banking side, all of which give
us more products and capabilities to strengthen our customer base. And we are going to continue that. We've
alluded to additional talent and capabilities in the near-term and what we expect to be in a position to start talking
about that. But all of that's in that 4% guidance for [indiscernible] (01:06:21) for next year.

Okay. So, we're grateful for you joining us today. I just want to compliment Rich Pohle one more time. We do this

quality, improving capital and robust liquidity, and that's supported by consistent efforts from our 20,000
colleagues across the bank to deliver these results. We are a team, you know this, we're disciplined operators
