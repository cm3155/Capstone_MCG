Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact
of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to very little strategic
activity in capital raising.
Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered an ROTCE of 16%,
including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our most
stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses, offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard
evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8%
ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on
growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position.
Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now
how we plan to achieve these goals and our annual strategic update, appropriately titled, Delivering (sic) [Driving]
Growth Through The Next Decade.
Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he
is retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best.
Please now turn to the deck and to slide 3. What informs our confidence in growth strategy is that we know who
we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our
success to date and the next decade will be no different.
On slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a
common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We committed to
our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of
our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our
strength.
Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decade with a focus on aligning markets –
ourselves to the market where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets that
are on the whole more balance sheet light and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to
invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have a proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate
the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management.
Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of the businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we
may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured
consumer credit, payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we know
best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets. Please turn to slide 6.
This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we
expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pre-tax profit.
The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent
institutional franchise.
Fair to say our business model was tested this year, as you can see on slide 7. 2022 as the paradigm shift with
firstly the continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe over 70 years and the highest
inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well.
We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE, had the the most excess risk-based capital of our peers and
attracted over $300 billion of net new assets, all while integrating two major acquisitions.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
So now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade. Let's start with Wealth Management.
On slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class
advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth
accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provide the opportunity for clients
to migrate across channels. The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues,
something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80
million and over one-third of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only three years ago, where
95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million and none exceeded $100 million.
The history of the journey is illustrated on slide 7. Wealth Management has gone through a powerful
transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions of E*TRADE and Solium,
which have expanded our client base with two new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We're
focused on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets
under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach – and the reach that will propel
future growth.
Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to-date, and you can see the driving
forces highlighted on slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings allowing us to offer attractive
products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending
balances over the last three years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive, high-quality loans.
On the other side, our deposits franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII
through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base.
And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the
last rate hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes.
Let's turn to slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth, net new assets. Over the last three years, our platform
generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets, showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking
Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our
businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be ups and
down in individual years. But over a three-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new
assets.
Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater
than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a
combination of several things, which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money.
You can see on slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets. We've experienced that through our workplace
channel. We estimate now that relationships – well, held away has expanded by about four times in the last three
years. Our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion
of these assets.
Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps
to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants
and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
The results of our advisor-driven strategy are illustrated on slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the
majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take
several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering, that of our stock plan
administrative services.
Over the last three years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives
us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of
advice. To date, we've already seen advisor-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a
workplace relationship. Portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from
assets that were previously held away. In short, as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract
clients to advice is working.
Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as
you can see on slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more
than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger
revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from Fixed Income, Customization and Alternatives
continues to support results in more volatile equity markets. We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our
Alternatives investable capital is at $210 billion with strong growth in private credit, real assets, including
infrastructure, our multi-strategy hedge fund platform and special situations. And customization by our market
leading Parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine.
Shifting to Institutional Securities on slide 15. We have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated
investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as
our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and investment banking
and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities.
On slide 16, you can see our Institutional business remains the top three global leader in the industry, as
demonstrated by a wallet share position. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in
relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence of our resources as illustrated
clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from 2021 to 2022 and our consistent G-SIB
surcharge of 3%.
Let's move to our capital strategy on slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory
requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses and
we've seen a steady decline in our SCB excluding the dividend add-on, reflective of our more durable business
mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently
positioned.
On slide 8 (sic) [18], you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for
future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable
earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enabled us to double our dividend, 2021, and further
increase it by 11% in 2022. But at the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher
levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our
shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the
business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand.
Shifting to how we see the future state on slide 19. Starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets
across Wealth and Investment Management, we've demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years

positive net new assets of approximately $300 million a year. Combining that with reasonable average market
assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead.
Now, let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered
$14 billion of pre-tax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating
approximately 50 basis points of revenue which is about what we're doing currently and a 30% pre-tax margin,
which is within 2% of what we're doing currently, if you put that math together, it should create of itself over $14
billion of pre-tax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the Wealth and Asset
Management businesses.
So, if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They
have not changed on account of what's gone on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we
need to support our longer term objectives.
Of note, we've added a new goal, that I spoke to earlier that we've talked about in the last six months, to generate
$1 trillion in net new assets approximately every three years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter-by-
quarter, year-by-year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over
three years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about, by the way, 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within
Wealth and Asset Management.
As we approach 2023, we do so with client confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of
our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of
Institutional Securities.
As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment.
However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to
achieve our goals over time.
I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results. And we'd be
delighted to take your questions.

Sharon Yeshaya
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you, and good morning.
In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion, and PBT was $14.1
billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion. The strategic
investments we have made over the last decade have paid off.
Wealth Management had a record year, and Fixed Income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While
the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed
very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do. The full year results included $470 million of
integration-related expenses, of which $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts,
EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter, respectively.
The full year ROTCE was 15.3%, and 15.7% excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter,
severance expenses of $133 million related to December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit of $89
million largely offset each other through net income.

The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full-year efficiency ratio was
72.4%. Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses principally
related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues were offset by higher non-compensation expenses,
primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend.
As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-
keeping requirement in the second quarter. As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively
managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency
opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. And
this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results.
However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains
scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related
expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately two-thirds
related to E*TRADE and one-third related to Eaton Vance.
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record
prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly – client engagement across Fixed
Income and Equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year, reflective of
seasonality and the macroeconomic environment.
Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking
revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second
best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transaction. Underwriting was
more challenged, in line with the broader market. Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the
last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher
quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods.
Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and
underwriting market volumes weighed on results. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialog and
engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity
should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to
take advantage of these windows of opportunity.
Equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a
global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year, primarily driven by lower market
activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage
revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels, driven by lower
equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across the region. Derivative
results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also
benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter.
Fixed Income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between
the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove
revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion.
Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated, and clients

repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in macro was supported by active secondary markets as
expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity.
Results in commodities were down significantly, and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas
businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and
loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million.
Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion
and a record pre-tax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related
expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%. Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our
deferred cash-based compensation plans, referred to as DCP. This negatively impact our full year revenues by
$858 million, with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses.
As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and
losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting
period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement.
Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-
related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%. Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based
flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311
billion in the year represent a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets
were $52 billion with contributions across channels.
Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional
revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement
and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to Fixed Income products.
Bank lending balances grew by $17 billion in the year or 13% and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending
growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and
tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by paydowns in securities-based lending due to the higher
interest rate environment.
Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among
our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisors with expanded tools
needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment.
Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix,
largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients'
needs.
Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the
benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12
months.
Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We entered the year with an attractive deposit base with
higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters, we
anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve
is realized.

Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The
challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds, and also
impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by
Equities and Fixed Income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for
Alternatives and Solutions, particularly Parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies
and private credit.
Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average
AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual
basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter.
Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our
private Alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gained from having Fixed
Income, Parametric customization and Alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to
invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet
continued global client demand.
Turning to the balance sheet. [ph] Total stat (00:30:38) assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by
$9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1
ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs partially
offset by capital actions contributed to our strong CET1 ratio.
We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in
the quarter. The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the
realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some
quarterly volatility.
The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While
there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain confident in the durability of the firm
and the growth opportunities in the year ahead.
Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us ballast, importantly,
our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early
in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement we've seen so far.
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We are now ready to taking questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with
Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks so much. I appreciate all the slides, too. Okay, two big picture questions, I guess. One, James, with
the 200 basis points of excess over your CET1 requirements, and the big buffer served you well, you've got a lot
of buybacks, but also it's dilutive to returns. And I'm just curious, how you balance that of keeping that buffer? Or
is that buffer more temporary weighting on Basel III endgame final results? Or is that something you want – you
plan on sitting at? I'm just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Good morning, Glenn. It's a great question, and it's sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the
firm because right now I think capital strategy is critical.
There are a few things going on. Firstly, we have been able to reduce our peak to trough in CCAR because of the
change in mix in our business. Secondly, because of the market environment, we've reduced RWAs, just we've
taken maybe a more prudent lean in. And obviously, we can reverse that at any point in time, which eats up
CET1. Thirdly, we have the Basel III, finally looks like it's coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the
year, although I don't expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the
beginning of 2025.
So while there's a pretty long timeframe, a year is a long time in this business, let alone a year-and-a-half. I still
think that it's prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just – I'd rather be in a position where we have
excess capital when particularly in an environment where we don't see obvious places we've put it to work.
Now that said, we did our best. We bought back, I think it was $8 billion and – $10 billion last year. We doubled
the dividend the year before. We increased the dividend 11% last year. Obviously, we're – I mean, it's fair to
assume that we're going to continue moving on capital distributions. But, I like a number of 15%. We actually – we
triggered a little higher than that this quarter. We could easily drop down to 14.5%. That wouldn't bother me at all,
but that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities.
So, great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially. And we can always act
aggressively, and we've proven we will do that when we have more clarity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that. One other big picture, is – so Wealth Management's growing, great, everybody's happy. I think
historically and even now, you've been considered very equity-centric firm, whether it be Wealth and Asset
Management or your dominant equities platform. So, curious if you're thinking about – it's possible with these
higher rates, lots of clients shift to a more defensive stance, there's good income out there to be earned without

much risk – or too much risk. If we see a more material shift towards fixed income appetite in general, do you
think that in any way disadvantages Morgan Stanley as a firm and overall profitability?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I mean, listen, our share of Fixed Income is 10%; Banking, 15%; Equities, 20%. So obviously, the Fixed Income
pool grows – by the way, I shared a few years ago, it was 6%. So the team [ph] under its Head in (00:36:37) Sam
Kellie-Smith has done a phenomenal job. But if the pool grows faster in Fixed Income, just arithmetically, you're
not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in Equities.
That doesn't bother me a whole lot. I mean, we've never tried to be the FX/EM shop. We've never had the global
rates trading – FX trading macro businesses that some of the correspondent-driven commercial banks have [ph]
had (00:37:03), the HSBCs and Citis. And that's a business model, just [ph] different. So we just (00:37:07) – we
don't have as big transaction services, so we're not going to have as much FX.
That said, what the team have done in macro under Jakob under credit and Jay Hallik in commodities is really
impressive. So, I'm totally fine with that. And we clearly have the product. It's not like we don't sell muni bonds to
our clients and we don't have fixed income underwriting, et cetera. We have the product. It's just arithmetically,
given our share relative to the others, we wouldn't grow as fast. By the way, I was happy to see I think Equities
was back at number one this quarter, core franchise. We're really well positioned, Glenn. I'm not bothered by that
at all.

Hey. Good morning.

Good morning.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess maybe first question, just Sharon, following up on the efficiency ratio about 72% for 2022. As we think
about the journey from 72% to something sub-70% kind of in line with your strategic target, give us a sense of
what it needs. Is it just time and other businesses growing, which are more efficient and that changes the mix? Or
could we see that sub-70% even over the next couple of years? Would love to hear in terms of both from a timing
standpoint and what needs to happen at the firm to get to a sustainably below 70% efficiency ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. So if you think about, we were -- we've been below 70%, right? So, you look back to the last couple years,
and there are periods of time where we are below, there's obviously two pieces to it, both the expense side and
the revenue side. I think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses, each of those dollars that we
put to work will be more and more efficient.

As I highlighted where we've been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side. I noted that in my
prepared remarks, and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the
broader integrations of all of the platforms that we've acquired over the last couple years.
So as I think through it and I think about the timing, obviously, a different revenue environment will certainly help.
And there's tremendous operating leverage, particularly as you think about the Institutional Securities business,
which will help to drive that.
Now, if you go through each of the businesses, each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage, right? If
you have a constructive market environment, we've seen very strong margins also from the Investment
Management business. We're on our way to achieve the 30% margin target as you relate to the Wealth
Management business.
So, I'd say, it's a balance of both, both the revenue environment and how that turns around and then just
continued discipline in making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going
forward. So, we've been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially
nine months that we've seen with this type of environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess, just a separate question around markets activity. Obviously, highly uncertain how Investment
Banking activity shakes out. But if the Fed were to pause and the central banks have done with the majority of the
rate hikes, is that enough to drive a rebound in M&A, ECM, DCM? Or do we need a lot more in terms of just
confidence returning to the market before we see IB activity picking up? Like, what are you hearing from your
clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Why don't I start and if James has anything to add? I basically say that from – if we think about the
Investment Banking pipeline, the pipeline itself isn't what's changed. What's changed is that movement from the
pipeline to realized. And when we think about what will cause that, that policy pivot, a peak in inflation, something
that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence both
with their own economic outlook and – or excuse me, their own company outlook, the economic outlook that
hinges on that, and then also just price clarity and valuation certainty.
Those are the things that, as you think through it, we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the
realized and announced stage. So, the macro environment that you laid out where there is more clarity on the
economy and then also a reduction in volatility should help that move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would say, I think Sharon said right. And I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and
underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact.
CEOs job is to drive growth in their businesses, and they do that two ways, organic and inorganic. And I've been
doing this a long time, and I've done both. And the only tricky part about inorganic, once you've got your strategy

set, is timing. And sometimes, you've got to ignore timing, but if the market is really volatile, behoove CEOs,
particularly those relatively early in their careers to be a little cautious, and that's what we're seeing. That will
change.

Operator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And just I'd like to wish Jon Pruzan best of luck. Looking forward
to watching his next chapter play out.
So Sharon, would love to double click on your expectations for NII. Hear you that it's sort of based on the forward
curve playing out, and encouraging certainly to hear it's not peaked. But could you maybe give a little bit more
color around expectations beyond forward curve? What do you assume for deposit dynamics? Do you think that
the decline in sweep balances will continue to decline? What's underlying that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. So let's take a step back and just say why did we outperform in the fourth quarter, Brennan. And if you think
about that, we obviously – when we look at the liability side, we outperformed there, and we performed on the
asset side. So if we unpack a little bit of the liability side, I take it into two pieces.
As you highlighted, it's obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing. So what we've seen in the deposit
mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those [ph] BDPs (00:43:50). Obviously, where
we will go from here, we'll need that to play out. But that is something that we take out into account when we think
about the first quarter guidance.
The second point is, obviously, on the actual liability pricing, we did see an outperformance of that pricing. And
when we exit the first quarter, we take that in – exit, excuse me, the fourth quarter and take that into the first
quarter, that's a benefit as well. So the Fed hiking 125 basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to
have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then certainly different question. Wealth Management, if we look at the client asset
trends, they were barely up quarter-over-quarter. Basically, total client assets in Wealth were up about the
equivalent of the net new assets. And can clearly see that self-directed and workplace were a little weak, probably
because their exposure – more exposure to the [ph] Qs and the (00:44:52) more growthy stocks. But I would
think, given what we saw in the markets that there'd be a bit more of a tailwind to client assets. Was there
anything unusual that was happening there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
No. Actually – and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure, the
underlying exposure of those different channels. So, it's just a function of the assets that you actually see as well
as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, wanted to dig in a little bit further, Sharon, as it relates to Brennan's question on NII. The two pieces I want to
understand a little bit better is, one, what are you assuming for SBL growth in the coming year or even loan
growth broadly across the wealth complex? And secondly, you saw really nice deposit growth in the fourth
quarter. Wanted to understand how much of that's a function of tax loss harvesting that you expect to be
redeployed? Or do you think any of that deposit growth is actually going to prove to be a bit stickier?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I'm just going to take them – I'll take them in order. The first is, as you asked about loan growth. The NII
guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections. Obviously, the loan growth itself will
be a function of the environment. As I said, from an SBL perspective, we have seen some paydowns and it will be
dependent on market conditions.
Now the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth. Obviously, there are –
there could be a portion of it that does come from, as you mentioned, different inputs that you might see, be that
interest, et cetera, in the end of the fourth quarter. But broadly speaking, what we've seen with the deposit base is
that we have many channels, i.e., savings, for example, where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new
deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources, external assets held away that come in. And also,
as you think about every piece of NNA that comes in over time, the $1 trillion that James mentioned, there's
generally a portion of that, that's actually held from a cash perspective. And so that, I think, also needs to be taken
account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit – a longer term deposit perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And just for my follow-up, as it relates to the trading outlook, I thought you guys did a really nice job
of articulating some of the potential sources or drivers of inflection in Investment Banking activity. Admittedly,
we've experienced a couple of years of pretty gangbusters trading and market activity. I was hoping to get your
perspective on how you're thinking about the outlook for the trading businesses. If you're willing to go so far as to
suggest what normalization might look like across both FICC and equities would be really helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I would look at it more holistically from an Institutional perspective. And so when I think about what does it
mean? We entered – I remember doing an investor conference in February of last year, and we talked a lot about
14

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
what is normal and is 2019 normal. And our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere
between 2019 and 2020 from an industry wallet perspective. In fact, it looks as though the industry wallet has just
been right around that range within those two bounds.
And when we look ahead, we would expect to remain above that 2019 level, and we'll have to see what the
upside is. But a lot of that growth in Sales & Trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has
also come from the fact that you have higher yields, right, so when you think about investing in the Fixed Income
product, and you go into that going forward, that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over
the earlier 2010 through 2019 or 2017 outlook for Sales & Trading.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the Wealth business and the rollout of the companion accounts
and the 90% that you've highlighted. Can you talk about the behavior change or what has happened subsequent
to clients receiving those companion accounts and try to get a sense of what that could mean on a longer term
basis in terms of increased activity and asset flows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Absolutely. As James highlighted in his prepared remarks, the intention is to generally be in a position where
we're able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into
the workplace. And so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account
rollout, eventually, what that's really doing is to make sure that we've provided content. We look at content, as I've
said before, as a passport into the employees. And you think about that as financial wellness. Something that Jed
highlighted in his presentation in the spring is, generally speaking, when you see $1 of vested assets that come
into the institution through the stock plan business, we actually see approximately $9 compared to that $1 that
come from assets held away. That's the consolidation of assets once you have this advice-based channel and the
advice-based relationship.
And so what we're trying to do is build on that. We have an FA referral process. We continue to use technology to
help match the right individuals with the right FAs. We have better relationship management within E*TRADE and
making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams. These are all ways to build
the right advice for the right clients to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into
the institution.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the longer-term efficiency potential. But I
guess the thing about fourth quarter, there was some severance looking at non-comp expense as you think about
next year. Just want to understand how we should think about the base level of expenses and potential changes
and/or where you're looking to be more efficient into this year?

Sure. I mean, we're always, as I said in my prepared remarks, looking at efficiency opportunities where they might
exist. As you highlight through the severance, we just had a December employee action. So we, obviously, walk
in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward. But as we've done
with our own resources from a capital perspective, we'll remain nimble and prudent, and look forward if and as the
economic environment changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think just on the efficiency ratio, it's worth pointing out and Sharon mentioned this earlier, if you actually average
the last two years, 2021 and 2022, you end up right at 70%. 2021 was about 67%, 2022 was at 73%, part of it's
revenue driven. We took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year.
We also want to feed the beast. I mean, we're growing parts of this firm. We're trying to – we don't – we're not of
the view that we're heading into a dark period, whatever negativity in the world is out there. That's not our house
view. So we want to make sure we're positioned for growth. This thing will turn. M&A underwriting will come back.
I'm positive of it. So, we want to be well positioned for it. But we're going to manage through that number of
around 70% as best as we can.

Operator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I have a bigger picture. James, you gave us some very good detail about the
expectations for growth in the Wealth Management and the new assets, $1 trillion every three years. When you
look at your three channels, the advisor-led, workplace and self-directed, where do you see the most growth? And
which one has the best margin that can get you to that 30% goal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, the advisor is the biggest, obviously, by far. We have 15,000, 16,000 advisors, phenomenal business. The
direct channel is from the acquisition of E*TRADE combined with our Morgan Stanley Direct. Great business.
Obviously, it's a little more market sensitive, little more active particularly on the options side during bullish market
environments. And the workplace is sort of the sleeper. I've said previously, I think, two years ago, I thought in a
decade, we'd look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change
happened over the last decade. I truly believe that the workplace employee, the retirement space is sort of the
next frontier, and we're right in the middle of that.
So as to margins, they're probably margin accretive in reverse order. In other words, workplace, first; the direct,
second; and the advisor, third. That's simply a function of [ph] advisors – we have (00:54:18) advisor payout. And
God bless them for the jobs that they do and we're very happy to pay them. So, I think it's a combination, Gerard,
of all three of them. We will hit the 30% margin. I mean, we're almost there now in a more challenging
environment. So that I have zero anxiety about whether it's this year or next year, it's coming, and all of them will
contribute.

Very good. Appreciate that. And Sharon, you talked about the marks that you took in the corporate loan portfolio
in the quarter, just over $350 million, I think you said. Can you share with us how big is that portfolio? And where
did the marks come from? Were they bridge loans? Or what drove those marks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So, you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending commitments that we give. As we
think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio. And it was also worth highlighting there that
we also mentioned the interest that you received on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with
those loans.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. James, last quarter, I asked you when will you be ready for plan B if the pipeline doesn't seem like it's going
to be converted, and you said you're at plan A minus. So, just kind of looking for an update there.
And in terms of the headwinds, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the pipeline is still good, but down quarter-
over-quarter because some of those deals have converted. And also, you said, it's still not back yet. And as it
relates to the Twitter financing, you were the lead bank, can you disclose any write-downs that you had on Twitter
or simply the leveraged loan category? So that's the headwind. On the other hand, I guess, there's been some
reports that you've reduced head count. So, if you could just give us more color on that, especially Twitter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Okay. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I'm not going to talk about Twitter. We don't talk about single names
as you would expect. You did see the line – the other ISG line, you can assume that whatever marks we took on
any single name are reflected in that. And I think the – the way I think about this is we run a portfolio business.
We obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others. But it's the total package,
and the total package, if you look at it, actually turned out to be very fine given the environment we're in.
So on the plan B, I don't know, if the rip we did – we took about 1,800 heads in early December, would equate to
a plan B. It certainly felt like it. We've reduced – we took a severance charge, Mike, which affected some of the
efficiency ratio for this year, but we'll improve it for next year. And that was the rightsizing. We were frankly a little
overdue. We hadn't done anything for a couple of years. We've had a lot of growth, and we'll continue monitoring
that. Obviously, with the way bonus pools work, we reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool. So
we're not very different from the rest of the world in that regard. And that obviously resets comp a little bit.
So I feel good about where the whole package is. I'm actually, as I said earlier, alluded to I'm a little more
confident about the long – medium-term outlook for the market. I'm not talking about the first quarter or two,
although Sharon said the first quarter has actually started well. But the medium-term outlook for the markets, I
see the Fed has moved from 75 basis points to 50 basis points, likely to go to 25 basis points. The next stop on
the train line is zero and then eventually they'll start cutting. Not sure, they're going to cut this year, but I think
there'll be zero increases this year for sure. So that's the inflection point. And there's a lot of money sitting around
waiting to be put to work. And that's our job is to be the flow of capital between those who have it, and those who

need it. So, I'm pretty confident actually about the outlook. So we're – we've done our plan B, I guess. We're not
anticipating a plan C. And we're going to watch and wait for a little while, but I feel pretty good about it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the flows within Investment Management,
both the long term and liquidity and how you're thinking about the outlook there specifically in the long term?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Absolutely. The long term, obviously, what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in
Equities. That was the most notable. That obviously had to do with some of the higher growth specific – specific
funds that we have there. But I think you have to really think about those long terms from a long-term basis, right?
So, you're just focusing on this year, but there were many, many years of very strong flows into that business.
What's important is actually the diversification that we had because of Eaton Vance, where we have other
products that we were able to offset some of the outflows in, say, the equity product, for example. So Parametric
is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year. We're really focused on the
secular growth trends, sustainability, alternatives and customization more broadly. Those are the things that we
think as we move forward will be positive for those line items.
