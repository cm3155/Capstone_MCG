industry. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Form 8-K, 10-Q
and 10-K for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. And welcome to all the participants on the call. This morning, I will provide detailed thoughts
on the unique growth opportunities available to us at Valley and update you on our Corporate Social
Responsibility efforts. Mike will then provide additional details on the financial results before opening the call to
your questions.
In the first quarter of 2021, we reported net income of $116 million and earnings per share of $0.28. For the third
consecutive quarter, this represents the highest level of quarterly earnings in Valley's entire history. Return on
average assets was 1.14%, reflecting net interest margin expansion, stable expenses and a lower provision for
loan losses. Looking forward, we expect fee income to rebound, continue net interest margin strength and strong
loan growth. This should drive further positive operating leverage, strong financial performance and shareholder
value over time.
On last quarter's call, I mentioned our expectation for mid-single digit non-PPP loan growth in 2021. In the first
quarter, we generated 3.4% annualized growth in non-PPP loans. This growth was well-diversified from an asset
class and geographic perspective.
On the commercial side, non-multifamily CRE and C&I were strong contributors, and auto loans increased nicely
in the consumer portfolio. However, the net growth numbers don't tell the whole story. In the first quarter of 2021,
Valley originated over $1.6 billion of non-PPP loans. This represents the single highest quarter for loan
originations in our history. Our commercial loan pipeline now stands above $3 billion, which is also the highest
level in our history. These statistics represent what we can control. We can build commercial and retail
relationships and drive meaningful activity by providing premier service. We have less control over the pace of
pay-offs, which remain elevated and have weighed on our net loan growth. Still, we feel very well-positioned to
achieve our loan growth goals through the course of the year.
We mentioned in the fourth quarter call that we're increasing our C&I lending staff in Florida by 25% or
approximately 15 individuals. 12 of those 15 lenders are now on board, with half focused on middle market and
the other half on business banking. We have also added eight new C&I lenders in the Northeast, spread across
our middle market, business banking and healthcare segments. We will continue to selectively augment our
lending team to ensure we are positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities throughout all of our markets. Our
talent is supported by the technology tools that enable nimble responsiveness and premier service.
From a balance sheet perspective, we have the capital and deposit funding to support the loan growth that we
expect to achieve as the economy continues to rebound. Geographically, we saw more than 50% of our
commercial loan growth come out of Florida during the quarter. Activity has been particularly strong in Palm
Beach, Broward County, Jacksonville and Orlando, where previous hires attracted from larger competitors are
paying dividends. There is a real momentum here that will continue to be supplemented by the additional hires I
referenced earlier.
We have strategically built a loan portfolio and lending team that is well-diversified across asset classes and
geographies. Our significant market presence and stable Northeast markets is supplemented by a robust

commercial lending operation in more growth-oriented Florida markets. Future growth is expected to remain well-
balanced between these markets. We believe this differentiated approach sets us apart from many of our regional
peers and will ensure a consistent pool of growth opportunities remains available to us.
With that said, I also want to mention some important strides we have made as corporate citizens. During 2020,
we continued to promote social and economic justice. We emphasized inclusion among our associates and
communities by expanding our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and partnering with local justice-focused
organizations. Our communities remain at the heart of what we do. In 2020, our employees volunteered almost
7,000 hours of their time, and as an organization, we gave nearly $4 million to local charities. We've also
developed a new community lending group that will focus on serving the unique needs of underrepresented firms
across all of our markets. We are proud to have received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating
from the OCC.
In 2020, we also established an ESG Council to further our approach to environmental, social and governance
issues. Our ESG Council will guide our efforts to practice sound ESG stewardship with respect to our employees,
shareholders, customers and overall society. We will also use ESG best practices to mitigate the risks presented
by these issues as we pursue our long-term strategic initiatives.
For more details on these efforts and our recent successes, I welcome you to view our 2020 Corporate Social
Responsibility Report on our website. We understand the importance of these issues, and we'll continue to devote
time and resources to ensuring we fulfill our potential as a well-respected and leading corporate citizen.
As you can tell, there is plenty going on at Valley. We are constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of our
markets and our diverse constituents. We continue to generate strong net interest margin performance and
diverse loan growth opportunities. We are very excited for the rest of the year, and confident we will continue to
drive strong financial performance and shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some additional financial highlights.

Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 4, you can see that Valley's reported net interest margin increased to 3.14% from
3.06% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The majority of this increase was related to accelerated PPP loan
forgiveness. However, net interest margin would have still increased 1 basis point sequentially, absent the effects
of PPP. This stability reflects continued earning asset mix shift as average cash balances declined and average
loans increased modestly. Importantly, much of the quarter's loan growth occurred in March. The impact on
average balances and earnings will begin to emerge in the second quarter.
We continued to actively manage the funding side of the balance sheet and drove another 9 basis point reduction
in our interest-bearing liability costs during the quarter. This reflects lower deposit rates and a full quarter's benefit
from the FHLB borrowings prepayment that we executed in the fourth quarter. As is typical, the first quarter's day
count also had a modest negative impact on the reported margin.
During the quarter, we utilized excess liquidity to fund the run-off of higher cost brokered deposits. This trend
continued into April and our average cash balance continues to decline. With strong loan originations and select
liability re-pricing opportunities, our net interest income should grow as the year progresses, absent the impact of
PPP forgiveness volatility.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
You can see more detail regarding the impacts of PPP income on slide 5. We estimate that PPP contributed 8
basis points to the margin versus 1 basis point in the fourth quarter. As you can see in the bottom left, we have an
additional $600 million forgiveness request pending approval by the SBA. All in, approximately 57% of our Round
1 and 2 originations have now received or requested forgiveness.
Through March, 31, 2021, we have recognized approximately $49 million of PPP loan fee income since the
inception of the program. I will speak to the results of our Round 3 PPP origination shortly. From an income
perspective, however, as of March 31, an additional $57 million of PPP loan fees will be recognized as
outstanding loans are forgiven or repaid.
Slide 6 outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to re-price liabilities over the next four
quarters. We have over $3 billion of retail CDs set to mature in the next two quarters at an average rate of around
57 basis points. We expect the majority of these funds will be retained in lower cost CDs or transaction accounts
at rates closer to 25 basis points. We also have additional opportunities on the borrowing side, including the
pending maturity of $500 million of higher cost borrowings early in the third quarter of 2021.
As a result of active balance sheet management and significant deposit growth, our net interest margin has been
extremely resilient over the last few years. We remain modestly asset-sensitive and expect to continue to
outperform peers from a net interest margin perspective going forward.
Slide 7 illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding profile. Total deposits increased another 2% during the
quarter, fueled by a 9% increase in non-interest bearing balances and a 7% increase in other transaction
balances. Continuing our recent experience, CD balances declined 19% during the quarter. A portion of this run-
off was in brokered balances. These dynamics contributed to the sequential 5 basis point reduction in deposit
costs.
From a total deposit growth perspective, we have benefited from successful cross-sell of deposit products into our
commercial customer base. Our exceptional deposit growth positions us to fund the future loan originations that
will result from our strong pipeline. We continue to build out deposit products and services to further diversify our
growth channels. To this end, we recently revamped our online account opening process and expect to add new
digital deposit products in the coming months.
Page 8 provides an overview of the recent acceleration of online and mobile banking adoption among our
customer base. We continue to assess the performance of our physical delivery channels and look for
opportunities to further enhance efficiency in our physical delivery.
As a reminder, in 2020, we rolled out a pilot program to provide banking services to businesses and multi-state
operators in the cannabis space. We took a differentiated approach of combining industry-leading risk
management with a value enhancing offering for our commercial customers. As we exit our pilot phase, we are
positioned to capitalize on growth in the cannabis space as legislative support continues to build momentum. We
will update you on our progress as this business becomes material.
Slide 9 details our loan portfolio and origination trends over the last few quarters. Average loan yields were
effectively flat during the quarter, benefiting from elevated income from PPP forgiveness. As Ira mentioned, we
originated a record $1.6 billion of non-PPP loans during the quarter. While origination activity has been robust in
recent months, elevated pay-offs continue to weigh on net loan growth. The pace of future loan pay-offs is
uncertain, so we remain encouraged by our strong and diverse lending pipeline.

The right side of page 10 lays out the details around our Round 3 PPP activity. We originated over $850 million of
new PPP loans over the last few months. The average loan size in Round 3 is lower than our previous
experience. This contributed to a higher average processing fee of 4%. In Round 3, we continued to focus on
minority and women-owned businesses. In total, the PPP experience has been extremely rewarding for Valley.
We filled the need in our local communities and executed at a very high level.
Our NPS Scores related to PPP have been extremely high and the level of differentiated service that we were
able to provide has increased demand for our other products and services.
Moving to slide 11, we generated non-interest income of $31 million for the quarter. The reduction was driven by
lower swap and residential mortgage gain on sale income. We expect swap income to rebound to high-single
digits in the second quarter of 2021 with steady improvement from those levels for the remainder of the year. Gain
on sale income should also improve to a high-single digit level, but could decline from that point, given the
expectation slowing refinance activity as the year progresses.
As we said on our previous call, we do recognize that certain fee lines will ebb and flow with market conditions.
However, enhancing fee income remains a strategic focus of our company. We continue to explore less cyclical
opportunities to develop business lines that will contribute to greater consistency and revenue diversity.
On slide 12, you can see that our adjusted expenses were stable in the first quarter at $157 million. The quarter
included over $700,000 of expenses associated with seasonal snow removal. Our adjusted efficiency ratio ticked
up to 48.6% from 47% in the fourth quarter with the increase reflecting the reduction in fee income during the
quarter. We remain focused on relative expense control and positive operating leverage.
Since the first quarter of 2020, our revenue has grown at nearly two times the pace of expenses. This trend is
consistent over a longer horizon as well. Over the last five years, our quarterly revenue has increased at an
annual rate of 14%, which is more than two times the pace of annual expense growth in the same period. Looking
forward, we continue to explore opportunities to generate positive operating leverage and are building the talent
and infrastructure to leverage our strong balance sheet with a focus on organic loan growth. As this growth is
realized, we will continue to drive towards industry-leading efficiency levels.
Turning to slide 13, you can see our credit trends for the past five quarters. During the quarter, we maintained our
allowance for credit losses at 1.17% of non-PPP loans. We recognized that renewed economic optimism has
driven negative provision and reserve releases across the industry. While we share this optimism, our first quarter
CECL model remained partially weighted to recessionary scenarios. We revisit our model each quarter, and given
the economic tailwinds beginning to emerge as well as the successful pace of vaccine rollout, it is possible that
we increase the Moody's baseline weighting going forward. All else equal, this could lower our future reserve
levels.
Our non-accrual loan balances continued to hover around 60 basis points of loans, give or take. Accruing past
dues declined to $53 million from $99 million in the prior quarter. This represents the lowest absolute level of
accruing past dues since the second quarter of 2018. While we remain conservative by nature, our borrowers
have been extraordinarily resilient throughout the pandemic. During the quarter, our active deferrals declined to
$284 million or 0.9% of total loans versus 1.1% in the fourth quarter. Additional detail on deferrals can be found in
the appendix.

As we have reiterated throughout the crisis, Valley's historical credit strength remains a distinguishing
characteristic of our organization. As a result, we expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in
any economic environment.
Slide 14 illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the continued improvement in our capital
ratios. Tangible book value has increased 8% in the last 12 months, driven by our increased earnings power. Our
tangible common equity ratio increased to 7.55% from 7.47% in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for our $2.4 billion of
PPP loans, tangible common equity would have been above 8%.
On a year-over-year basis, we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory capital ratios, which
gave us the flexibility to redeem $60 million of subordinated debt on April 1. This tranche had been acquired from
USAB and carried a 6.25% cost. All else equal, this would lower our total risk-based capital ratio by approximately
20 basis points. We expect to offset the majority of this impact with retained earnings during the second quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some closing commentary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. This quarter was highlighted by the continuation of our strong performance trends. Our net interest
margin has been extremely resilient, reflecting our active balance sheet management and loan and deposit
tailwinds. We continue to control expenses and drive positive operating leverage. Our capital levels are robust
and we are positioned to drive significant organic growth on both sides of the balance sheet across our entire
franchise.
This strong and consistent performance is the results of the performance-oriented culture that we have developed
over the last few years. There is a real momentum here at Valley. While we continue to evolve and refine our
approach, we are committed to remaining a high-performing institution for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Steven Alexopoulos
with JPMorgan. You line is open.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A

Good morning, Steven.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Ira, I wanted to start on online competition, because we've been told for years that with customers now being able
to move money more easily, they could go online, check rates that banks like yourself would have to pay closer to
market rates for deposits, and you're telling us that your 57 basis points CDs are going to be retained somewhere
in the 25 basis point range, which is well-below what online players such as Chime are paying. So, my question
is, are you – as you move those rates down, are you seeing customers move balances out of the banks to Chime
and other players that are just paying more, or are customers staying with you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
We're definitely seeing a customer retention, Steve. We're actually seeing customer growth. When we look at unit
of accounts, I know there's been a surge in deposits across the entire industry, we're focused on growth in
households, growth on what our customer experience looks like. But on individual units, I mean, we're up 7.5%
linked quarter on an annualized basis in unit of personal accounts. We're up 8.5% on an annualized basis in
business accounts, and year-over-year, we're up 8% as well. So we've seen a real positive trend continue across
both business and consumer accounts.
Our NPS Scores within the online banking channel is actually better than what we got within the branches. So I
think it's a combination of having a terrific online banking experience, as well as that relationship focus within the
branches, we tend to see a lot of our customers want the ability to bank online, but want the safety and security to
know that there is somebody that they have the ability to connect with. So I think it's a combination of a
comprehensive strategy not an individual one, and we're seeing real core growth in our organization, and it's a
focus I think on that customer experience.

Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And, Ira, on customer sentiment, you guys are in a very unique position, because
you have exposure to the Northeast, and Florida, right? We know Florida is much more open than New York and
New Jersey today. Can you contrast for us business sentiment amongst your customers in the Northeast versus
Florida? And maybe talk about what difference you're seeing in terms of them building own pipelines here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Hey, Steven, it's Tom Iadanza. I think, as Ira pointed out early in the presentation, about 40% of our
production on the commercial side is coming out of Florida, and about 50% of our growth is coming out of Florida.
We still exhibit very stable growth in production in the Northeast, again, across all [ph] orders (00:24:12) of our
business. We're more suburban than we are Manhattan based here. We are seeing higher C&I growth today in
the Northeast, because that's been our focus for the last four years here, and we're starting to see that C&I
growth in the South in the Florida or Alabama markets as we add staff down there.
Pipelines are now – for the most part, I would say, it's 40% of the pipeline is Florida based on the commercial
side, 60% is still New York, New Jersey. More importantly or equally important is on the consumer. We are now
50-50 refinance to purchase, but we have seen about a 30% increase in the purchase portion down in Florida
over the last quarter. So we're starting to take advantage of that migration down on both a business and
consumer side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. But, Tom, I'm trying to understand, are you seeing a big difference in customer behaviors in Florida today
versus the Northeast?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
From the standpoint of customers building inventory, customers building whether it's a real estate project, very
similar, you're seeing a bit more activity in Florida in different product categories, it's still retail, you're still doing
office down there, you're still doing a lot of multifamily. It is lower up here on that build than it is in Florida and it's
lower up here on C&I inventory build than it is in Florida. So there is more activity in Florida.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. And then final question for you, Ira, it's clear, M&A in the Northeast is certainly percolated. Do you
think that you can be competitive in your markets with roughly $40 billion of assets, or do you think you need to
join many of these other banks that are jumping up to that $60 billion, $70 billion, $80 billion asset threshold?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks for the question. Look, I think there is varying reasons as to why each organization looks at M&A. We
have real strong organic growth that's taking place in our organization. We're focused on relationship banking
model, leveraged by technology, not the other way around. And as a result, I think being focused from a strategic
perspective, we do have the ability with where we are today to continue to deliver outsized performance on an
organic perspective.

That said, I think there is always opportunities when we look at M&A and are there institutions, both bank and
non-bank, that potentially would be accretive and help us accelerate some of the individual strategic objectives
that we've outlined. So, to answer your question directly, I think, we are of an opportunistic size definitely to
continue to grow the organization. But that said, I think if there is an opportunity to continue to grow via layering in
some M&A, it's something that we would be up into as well.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Just on the – Ira, I think you reiterated mid-single digit loan growth, but I just wanted to make sure
that was messaging, and then, any bias one way or the other in terms of that growth rate for the full year, just
given how strong originations are even at start of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Frank, it's Tom again. I think the single-digit growth given where our pipeline is today and that $3
billion range, which is probably 25% above the pre-pandemic levels, gives us confidence that we'll meet that level.
The only caution is the pull-through will be lower, there's much more competition, much more loosening of terms.
One of the important components of us hitting our growth number is not to compromise our credit standards and
our underwriting standards, which we did not. We're still a very diverse, growing in all regions, all product type,
C&I, real estate, still very granular. Average real estate loan is still in that $4 million range. Average C&I loan is
still at $1 million range. We're going to maintain those standards.
The impact of every bank being very hungry for loans might prevent us from hitting – pulling through that full $3
billion that we're talking about. Additionally, we have taken advantage of the aggressiveness in the market. We
exited about $150 million of New York City multifamily loans that we acquired through the Oritani acquisition, non-
relationship, lower yielding and moved out of that and still replaced and grew that 3.4%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly from me on – it seems like you can handle as much deposits in the door as
you want, how do we think about, I know it's a small piece of the overall franchise, but if I think about the Alabama
portion of the footprint, how could that change over time? Do you retain that? How does the strategy there – first
of all, what is the strategy now and how could that change over the near-term?

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Let me just maybe address the question first. So, maybe I would disagree a bit. I don't think it's easy to get the
type of deposits that we want today. I think anyone can grow deposits based on sort of surge deposits and based
on not real relationships, those are transaction-type deposits. Our growth in households, our growth in
relationships is something that we focused on. I think when we looked at even from a PPP perspective, we could
have absolutely done more PPP. We could have absolutely been on every single leader board when it came to
PPP, but it would have been inconsistent with our focus from a strategic perspective and making sure that we
were relationship first and how we looked at growing the overall franchise.
So from our perspective, it's the individual liability side of the balance sheet, the growth in households, the growth
in profitability, those individual relationships that drives franchise value. Putting up unbelievable deposit numbers
when they're transaction and really – don't really drive franchise value from our perspective, I think as that layers
into the Alabama, I think we look at it from a more holistic perspective, are they additive to the organization when
we think by stable funding base? Is there franchise value that comes out of that? And today, the answer is, yes.
And we continuously reassess every single geography, every single product we have within the organization to sit
and say, is this the best use of our capital? Is this the best use of our resources? And is it providing the best
franchise value to the overall organization?

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike. I'll take a stab at that one. When you look at the sequential change from fourth quarter to first quarter
of 8 basis points, the two largest increases that drove that were the impact of PPP and the impact of our interest-
bearing liability, cost reduction, both of which we think are going to be robust going into the second quarter. And I
would say that the latter, the interest-bearing liabilities will continue into the third and fourth quarter, and you can
see that in our IP.
The other thing is the number of days was a negative drag on that sequential comparison, and that's obviously
going to improve in the second quarter. So what I'm telling you is I think margin could actually – as stated, margin
could actually be better than 3.14% in the second quarter. And then once all of the majority, it's not all, but the
majority of those PPP fees that are enhancing margin are taken through the income statement, you'll see a
reduction in margin for that reason alone. But we still have these other movers that we're working on, not the least
of which is our interest-bearing deposit costs, which we still have more room.

I was hoping just in terms of the ACL ratio, in the press release you guys mentioned that it looks like you boosted
reserves related to certain commercial real estate loans. Can you just talk a little bit about that specifically, like
how meaningful was that?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It was a single loan, I think, you were referring to that we moved into our non-accrual category. It's pretty
small relative to the size of the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
The biggest mover on our CECL reserve was clearly to weightings that we put on the Moody's estimate. So, just
to be real clear about the 60% on the baseline, which had previously been 30%, 30% on S3, which is a
recessionary scenario, which had been previously 50%, and 10% on S4, which is the prolonged slump. Within
those components in the Moody's estimates, because of the way it works, it's less focused on the GDP number,
honestly, but more focused on the U3 number because of the difference in U3 unemployment, each one of those
scenarios.
And so what our comments were meant to say is we really felt that was prudent going into the quarter, thinking
about the pace of the vaccine rollout, there is a ton of uncertainty about it, side effects, was the economic rebound
actually driven by fundamentals or was it being driven by a lot of government money that's just sloshing around in
the economy. So taking everything into its totality, we thought that was the best approach. And that resulted in us
taking some measure of provision $9 million in the first quarter. So in our comments we said, all things being
equal, we would expect that number to being somewhat reduced. I'm not saying that will actually go to negative,
but absent loan growth, it's higher than what we're projecting, which would also drive a higher level of
provisioning. I think the bias will be towards a lower number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That now makes sense. And then just, Tom, in terms of mortgage banking, obviously [ph] it felt like
(00:35:50) you expect to rebound in that next quarter, can you just explain exactly what did happen with mortgage
banking this quarter to drive the lower revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So, our estimates were – think of it this way, we're basically a fair value shop. So, our entire balance sheet is
done using the fair value conventions. And when you look at the way that works from an accounting perspective,
at the end of the quarter, you're recording a number that's fair value of what you think the next quarter production
is going to be, and that's a function of interest rates. So, because the level of production has been somewhat
challenged by the length of days that it's taking to close mortgages and get them to the GSEs, which typically
were around 60, 61, 62 days, stretched out to 90 based upon FTE counts and just the sheer level of refinance
activity, plus a reduction in rates from the fourth quarter to the first quarter resulted in that fair value adjustment
going down.
That production is still there and it's going to be delivered and that's what's going to drive the second quarter
number back up. So in totality, if you look over the entire period of time, all the revenue will be the same, it's just a
matter of which quarter it's recognized in. I know this is a tricky thing. I appreciate the question, but hopefully that
explains it.

Operator: Our next question coming from the line of David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. A follow-up on the fee income similar to your discussion around the gain on
sale and the dynamics around that, on swap income, you also guided to a rebound in the second quarter and then
kind of stabilizing. I was just curious what drives the variability in swap income from quarter-to-quarter? Is it a
certain type of loan that you originate? Or is it based on the level of interest rate and interest rate movements that
drives customers to hedge that movement?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It's essentially both. I think we produced more C&I in the first quarter and that tends to be shorter-term
floating. We did the same appropriate amount of fixed rate, but the fixed rate has shortened in term to – closer to
five-year than longer-term horizon. So typically five year and under, we're not swapping. Customers have an exit
strategy on the asset. So, it's really depends on the mix of the asset. Looking at what's in our pipeline is why we
believe it will come back to traditional slightly higher levels in the upcoming quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting gears, you spoke a little bit about the cannabis business. Can you frame
the opportunity? How big it is? And discuss how much of it is on the lending side versus the deposit side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think as anyone would test right now, the opportunity is tremendous. It really depends on how quickly the
government goes ahead and puts through different legislation. For us, it was really more of a risk management
focus and how we want to be proactive in addressing it as opposed to reactive. We spent well over a year putting
together risk management practices in place that made us comfortable that we'll be able to manage this risk
appropriately as well as growing. We've been very selective as to companies that we've targeted to do business
with. So right now it's really on the deposit side. We're just beginning to target a little bit on some of the lending
side. But we think overall that the industry is something that would drive performance at Valley well above peers
and we think we're going to be first in from any size perspective.

Obviously, a lot has been asked and answered at this point. I wanted to expand maybe on slide 8 for a minute
here. The revamp or the re-launch of the deposit account online opening process, I was wondering if you could
maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how much of your deposit accounts or incremental deposit
accounts are being opened online today and where you think that could trend with kind of this new platform or
hoping it could trend, maybe just expand a little on kind of the economic impact of that, right, in terms of kind of
the efficiencies that could be gained if more of your account opening moves online versus in-store presumably?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
We'll give you – I think we [indiscernible] (00:41:06) a little more of a clarity and an update and we'll put together a
more detailed slides next quarter on some of that. But we're seeing monumental growth within the – via our digital
channel today on a linked quarter basis versus where we were before, both in volume as well as in unit of
accounts. That said, Tom really spearheaded with a gentleman by the name Stuart Cook, who works for us on
new online account opening platform that I would rival against anyone within the industry, I think it's 3 minutes,
Tom?

Yeah, it's 3 minutes, which includes all of the compliance, checks to apply online, open and fund within two days
it'll appear there. It's – we're using it now for a single online account, but it will expand into several accounts and
ultimately be the account opening process used across our footprint. With the drive-in more mobile users online
users and less transactions being done at the branch, it'll allow our branches to be more focused on guidance and
consulting type services, especially with regards to a lot of the activity we're seeing in our mortgage, our
residential mortgage product.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And Mike, it's Travis. When we said in the prepared remarks that it was recently revamped, we mean that very
honestly like it's over the last couple of weeks, which is why we don't – we didn't put any real statistics in the deck.
But as you go forward, as Ira said, we'll put more clarity around that in terms of numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. No, understood. And so is it fair to assume that that's just on consumer account online opening side
at this point, I guess to Tom's point looking to expand, that's other things like business in the future or is it both
consumer and business online at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
At this point, it's consumer. It will be fully activated on a consumer accounts probably over the next two quarters,
and then by the end of the year, it will be both consumer and commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Mike, I think the one important thing here is the way that we've structured this enables us to really lever this as a
platform from growth across all different product types throughout the entire organization. So, it's not dependent
upon a third-party to make changes. We have the ability in-house to do – really begin to drive a lot of this, and we
think this is a growth platform for us. And once again, I think it's consistent with the technology strategy that we
put forth to make sure we own the ability to drive that customer experience as opposed to a third-party owning
that ability to drive the customer experience. It's a very differentiated model from what many of our peers are
doing, where they're just layering in with the third-party, whoever that may be to sit there and let them control what
that experience looks like. So, we think it will be differentiated. We think it will contribute to the growth we have
within the entire organization. And as Tom mentioned, it's going to help us from an efficiency perspective as we
think about what the physical experience should look like for many of our customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And Mike, I'll just – I'll finish this up by saying that from Q1 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021, business checking accounts
increased 8.2% and our personal checking accounts increased 4.1%, but that includes both online and in-person
openings. We'll figure out a way in the future to break that out for you, I think that's what you're asking. But it goes
back to what Ira said earlier that a lot of banks are just trying to fight to keep that even and they're probably losing
ground. And what's happening here is we're actually net positive, very nicely net positive account growth.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I mean, on a unit basis on online, we were up 56% linked quarter 4Q versus where we were at first quarter. So
pretty big numbers and I think we'll do a pretty decent job next quarter giving you a little bit more details. I think it
is something that's a big driver here for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. No, that would be great. Because obviously the big guys are disclosing like over 50% of accounts are
online, that's not exactly clear what's in that number, but obviously, it's a good proxy for the consumer
marketplace at least, right? So, I mean, I think it's pretty relevant to have this platform. And so I appreciate you
expanded color there.
And then just lastly, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but I was wondering if you could just – I know you
talked about credit a little bit, but just expand a little on the provision expense specifically, right? I mean it seems
like record pipeline, loan growth going to accelerate as the year progresses here, but hopefully the credit
conditions continue to improve. I mean, any thoughts on that dynamic and how that could balance out in your
provision line going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. As you pointed out, the question was asked and I hope it was answered earlier, but I'll try to do it again just
real quickly...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I was kind of jumping back and forth here. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
No trouble. The biggest movement is the choice of the Moody's models for us. So, 60% baseline, 30% S3 and
10% S4, mostly driven by our decision in the first quarter around – uncertainty around the pace of the vaccine
rollouts, combined with is the real fundamental economic rebound or is it more about government money. And so
because of that, we stuck to a little more – I would say, tilted towards a little more recessionary forecast. And so
my comments earlier were all else being equal, and keeping pace with loan growth, so obviously the way CECL
works is when you add new loans, you're going to have to keep pace with whatever category they're in. But
assuming that that's not the largest driver, I would expect the bias would be for us to take less in provision moving
forward, all other things being equal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. So, I mean, I know obviously it's way more complicated than this, but kind of growing into the ACL as
conditions improve, but you're loan balances hopefully expand.

Michael Perito Q

Probably an oversimplification, but I guess maybe said in another way, you're not targeting at this point with the
way you're balancing the Moody's forecast, any dramatic economic-related reserve release at this particular point
in time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think as I said earlier, it's going to be driven by the Moody's scenarios that we pick, and as Moody's
changes the numbers for both GDP and U3 unemployment in their models as well.
