Thank you, Sylvia and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call
with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website on slide 2 you will see a
discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear references to various non-
GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insights into the company's operations. Reconciliations of
non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectation about
future events and overall operating plan and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2020

earnings release, our 2019 annual report to shareholders, and these may be supplemented in our third quarter
2020 10-Q report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, we see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that you'll see our
adjusted operating results followed by operating results excluding unlocking which management believed
enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and
facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. The
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results excluding unlocking.
And with that I'll turn it over to Jim.

James Michael Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Clearly, the operating environment in the
quarter had ongoing challenges with both elevated market volatility and the impact of extremely low interest rates.
While there has been good growth in equity markets, volatility has returned given the election and the unknowns
related to the virus. Overall, I feel very good about how Ameriprise is performing against this backdrop. Client
activity and organic flows are strong which is a real positive as we operate through this pandemic. We continue to
invest strategically to further enhance our position. In addition, our capital strength continues to be a clear
differentiator.
Our results are good considering the environment. Extremely low interest rates pressured our results, which is
why revenues were down 1% with adjusted operating earnings per diluted share down 1% excluding unlocking
and the sale of the auto and home business. Due to the significant move in short-term rates, revenues and
earnings were reduced by $116 million year-over-year. This precipitous drop in rates muted the underlying
revenue growth in earnings, which would have been up 3% with EPS up 18%. We've offset some of the interest
pressure with good expense management. In fact, G&A expenses were down 5% year-over-year and we will
continue our disciplined efforts here.
We continue to have good margins and generate substantial free cash flow while we invest in the business and
return to shareholders. Our return on equity remains well above many peers at 35.5% ex-unlocking. In terms of
assets under management and administration, we ended the quarter with a record of nearly $1 trillion dollars.
Let's begin with Advice & Wealth management. Client activity and flows are good. The Ameriprise differentiated
advice value proposition works well both in this environment and for the long term. Total client assets increase
nicely, up 9% to $667 billion with strong client inflows including $5.2 billion in wrap flows which is a 26%
improvement over last year.
Meanwhile, transactional activity picked up from the lows of last quarter. And although it's 3% below last year, it is
returning to more normal levels as conditions improve. Client brokerage cash balances are very high, up 24%
year-over-year. And as opportunities arise over the next few quarters, we expect clients to put even more of their
money back to work.
Being digitally enabled with extensive web and mobile capabilities has been core to the excellent client
engagement and the client satisfaction we're driving. We're working with clients really well in this environment and
we're getting very positive feedback. Our advisors are helping their clients stay focused on their long-term goals,
which they can track online. We're also receiving great feedback from advisors about our integrated ecosystem of

capabilities which is helping them operate their practices remotely, process business efficiently and serve their
clients well.
This high level of support gives us the ability to help advisors be more productive. The advisor productivity was up
3% in the quarter even with the slowest summer months in this pandemic and the low interest rates. The
significant drop in short rates also muted the underlying growth in productivity which would have been up nicely at
8%.
Turning to recruiting, we welcome 99 highly productive experienced advisors to the firm in the third quarter.
Activity continue to pick up over the summer as our virtual recruiting program helped us connect with even more
top advisors across the industry, including from wirehouses, independents and RIAs. The fact that we had such
good success in getting advisors to move during this period points to the strength of our value proposition. We're
using our capabilities to engage more advisors and onboard them quickly in this environment. The pipeline
continues to look good.
In regard to our banking activities, we had more than $6 billion of sweep deposits and $7 billion of total assets at
the bank already and we expect to continue to move additional sweep deposits next year. We also launched our
mortgage program nationally and we will be adding pledge loans in the fourth quarter. Our lending capabilities are
a great complement to our advice value proposition and the bank allows us to help clients with both sides of their
balance sheet.
The AWM margin, which was strong at 19.2%, and that's with the full weight of interest rates. In fact, the margin is
up 160 basis points from the second quarter, and as I mentioned earlier, expenses are well-managed with G&A
up only 3%. Keep in mind that that includes investments in the bank as well as increased volume-related
expenses from business growth. So as we grow from here, we feel good about our ability to continue to drive
margin improvement.
Now I'd like to move to Retirement & Protection Solutions. As we discussed with you, we continue to reposition
the business to reflect the interest rate environment and our conservative risk appetite. We are managing our
books in a very intentional way in terms of product changes, sales priorities, and product exits. As part of this
strategy, we moved our closed blocks of fixed and fixed indexed annuities to the corporate segment. And we
continue to reassess reinsuring our close fixed annuity in-force blocks.
Additionally, we are proactively shifting our variable annuity and mix away from products with living benefits. In
fact, our new structured product in variable annuities without living benefits represent 56% of total VA sales in the
quarter, more than double where it was last year. And this complements the wide range of competitive products
from other firms that we offer in our channel.
In protection, we're taken similar steps with a focus on growing our higher-margin VUL and disability products. In
fact, we saw a strong pickup in VUL sales of 58% year-over-year. We reduced our focus on IUL as it is less
attractive in this interest rate environment. You can expect that we will continue to manage the business in this
manner and this will help accelerate the shift in our business mix to wealth and asset management.
Now I'll turn to asset management where the improvements we've been making are translating into good results.
Assets under management at Columbia Threadneedle were up 6% year-over-year to nearly $500 billion. In terms
of financials, earnings were also strong, up 14% with good revenue growth and excellent ongoing expense
management. In fact, margin came in at nearly 44%, well above our target range.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
Our investment performance has been excellent during this period of intense volatility. This is a great credit to our
global investment operation and outstanding research. In equities on a global basis, more than 75% of our funds
on an asset-weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks for one, three and five year periods. And
within that, I also like to highlight that nearly 50% of our funds were in the top quartile. While this performance is
broad-based, importantly, it is particularly good across strategies we are focused on in terms of client demand.
In fixed income globally, our teams are delivering good performance. Our taxable performance is very strong at
about 80% of our funds above medium or beating benchmarks over one, three and five year periods. And in tax-
exempt fixed income, our three and five year performance globally is strong with some weakness in the one year.
I'd like to turn to flows now starting with global retail where we had another good quarter. Retail inflows were $1.7
billion, not including $300 million of inflows from former parent-related retail assets. This was a significant
improvement year-over-year. In the US, net inflows ex-former parent were $1.5 billion as we continue to deliver
very good results across distribution channels, particularly at large broker dealer firms and independents.
We're in net inflows at seven out of eight of our top firms and we're now delivering positive flows in each of the
past two quarters. Year-to-date net flows were $3.5 billion. And on EMEA, we returned to net inflows of $200
million after a long period of headwinds due to Brexit and economic weakness in the region.
In terms of institutional, we continue to gain traction globally, winning good higher fee mandates in all three
regions. We did have two low fee redemptions in the quarter that total $4.4 billion. One was an insurance client
that sold the business and redeemed which we fully expected from the transaction. The other was from a client
who was in a quant strategy for well over a decade and a half and redeemed largely due to an asset allocation
decision.
Adjusted for these two moves and former parent related outflows, we had $1.7 billion of net inflows in the quarter.
The institutional mandates we're winning are attractive higher-fee businesses that more than offset the lost
revenue from these lower fee outflows.
Overall in institutional, we've strengthened the core of the business in terms of consultant relations and client
service and we continue to build our pipeline. We'll also soon complete the final phase of the installation of our
technology platform for trading and portfolio management globally. This will help reduce our use of duplicate
legacy systems, drive additional efficiency and improve scale.
To sum up Asset Management, we have excellent investment performance and we're making real progress in our
distribution activities and intend to keep that focus.
So for Ameriprise overall, when I look at the business, we have strong value propositions, terrific distribution and
clear focus on execution. We're serving our clients well while generate significant free cash flow and shareholder
value. And from a capital perspective, we're able to deliver a differentiated level of return when most of our peers
have pulled back all while maintaining excellent balance sheet fundamentals.
We returned $448 million to shareholders in the quarter and are on track to return close to 90% of adjusted
operating earnings to shareholders for the year. And you saw the board approved a new $2.5 billion authorization
through 2022.
In closing, I'd like to take a moment to highlight that earlier this month we reached our 15th year anniversary as an
independent public company. I'm proud of what we accomplished, the respected brand we built and how we cared

for our clients, advisors and employees. We've been able to deal with very challenging environments during these
15 years to emerge even stronger just as we're doing today. As we moved into the fourth quarter, I continue to
feel good about how we're operating.
Now, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and I'll take your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise has delivered very strong financial and metric performance in light of the interest rate
environment both on a consolidated basis and across the business segments. Both revenue and EPS were down
slightly year-over-year on a reported basis as the interest rate headwinds of $116 million or $0.68 per diluted
share muted results. Normalizing for that, Ameriprise delivered revenue growth of 3% and $3 billion and adjusting
operating EPS growth of 18% to $4.27.
These favorable trends are evident across our business segments. Underlying Advice & Wealth Management
earnings were up 14%. Asset Management earnings and Retirement & Protection Solutions were both up 14%. I
will get into the details on subsequent pages.
Turning to slide 6. In AWM, total client assets grew 9% to $667 billion and wrap assets were up 14%, reflecting
continued strong wrap net inflows. Wrap flows increased 26%, $5.2 billion. Advisor productivity continues to trend
upward, reaching $668,000 per advisor on a trailing 12 month basis. Reported year-over-year growth was 3%.
But the growth rate increased 8% excluding the impact of interest rates. Strong experienced advisor recruiting,
new digital tools and capabilities and serving more of our target client market are the key drivers of this trend.
Lastly, cash and certificate balances remain elevated at nearly $40 billion. We earn 29 basis points on our off-
balance sheet brokerage accounts reflecting the low Fed funds rate. Our investment yield at the bank was over
150 basis points, demonstrating the yield opportunity from bring balances on to our balance sheet.
As you can see on page 7, financial results were clearly impacted by headwinds from rates. Advice & Wealth
Management adjusted operating net revenue and earnings both absorbed $116 million from the precipitous
decline in short-term interest rates. For comparative purposes, revenue was up 6%, PTI was up 14%, and the
margin was up 130 basis points after normalizing for interest rates. This was driven by strong wrap net inflows,
productivity gains, bank growth and market appreciation as well as effective expense management.
G&A expenses increased 3%, in line with expectations, as we continue to invest for future growth where
appropriate including the bank. We will continue to prudently manage our expense base and adjust accordingly
based upon the environment.
Turning to page 8, Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improvement in
flow trends. In the quarter, we had continued inflows and higher fee retail assets and institutional flows were
positive excluding significant outflows into low fee mandates and former parent assets. We will continue to
leverage global operational capabilities and provide diverse practical offerings with strong investment
performance. Overall, we are encouraged by the continued progress the businesses is making.
Adjusted operating revenues were $739 million, flat compared to a year-ago quarter which included $33 million in
performance fees. Adjusting for the timing of the performance fees, revenues increased 4% reflecting improved
flow trends, market appreciation and an increase in the management fee rate to over 52 basis points.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
Adjusted operating expenses remain well managed. General and administrative expenses remain well managed,
reflecting disciplined expense management with reengineering initiatives funding target investments for growth.
Pre-tax earnings were $198 million, up 14%. Results include $18 million of performance fee timing in the year ago
period and approximately a net favorable $10 million of impact from one-time items in the current period. This
strong performance was driven by improved net flows, market appreciation and expense discipline. Pre-tax
adjusted margin was quite strong at 44%, reflecting the positive revenue and expense trends.
Turning to page 9. You will see our new Retirement & Protection Solutions segment. As we continue to implement
strategy to target our focus, the businesses are a smaller portion of our earnings, so we combined the lines into
one segment. We are taking a more focused strategy for this business as demonstrated by changes to our
product features which focus on lower risk and higher margin products, while continuing to seek reinsurance
opportunities.
Additionally, we discontinued the sale of fixed annuities and fixed indexed annuities in the second quarter. As a
result, we moved the fixed annuities business into the corporate segment as the closed block just as we did with
long-term care a few years ago.
We have seen a nice mix in sales to retirement products without living benefits. In the quarter, 56% of our sales
were in products without living benefits, up from 25% a year ago. This improvement reflects traction in our new
structured variable annuity product we launched earlier this year.
In protection, sales of higher margin VUL were up 58% while indexed universal life, our product with lower margin
in this interest rate environment, declined 68%. We are continuing to assess and adjust product features to reflect
the current interest rate environment.
Financial results continue to perform in line with expectations. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings increased
14%, $206 million excluding unlocking impacts that were previously announced. This is primarily as a result of
lower surrenders and withdrawals that reduce the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, as well as lower
sales and higher ending market levels.
Claims are performed within expectations and we are not seeing material impacts from COVID on our protection
business. In addition, our closed block of long-term care earned $6 million excluding unlocking, which reflects
favorable claims experience. As we've preannounced, our unlocking impact in the quarter was approximately
$350 million after tax, across Retirement & Protection Solutions, long-term care and fixed annuities, primarily as a
result of changes to our interest rate assumptions. Importantly, the changes made this quarter were on a GAAP
basis. And changes in both the interest rate and grading period do not impact excess capital, which is calculated
on a statutory basis.
In the fourth quarter, we completed our statutory analysis reserve called asset adequacy testing. We proactively
completed an off-cycle asset adequacy test in the third quarter in conjunction with our unlocking analysis. We
determined from that analysis that there is no material impact on reserves on a statutory basis.
Now, let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong,
including our liquidity position of $2.8 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital, $1.7 billion,
effective hedging at 91%, and a defensively positioned investment portfolio. Our adjusted operating return on
equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $448 million to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and buyback. We are on track to return 90% of earnings to shareholders in 2020.

With that, we will take your questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Good morning. First question is around the real pickup in activity in the life sector around these annuity blocks.
Notably, we saw a bid for American Equities (sic) [American Equity] (24:45) on something and then we saw
Equitable with their variable annuity transaction. And now you've put your fixed annuity business in runoff. So the
question is, are you seeing a lot of interest in your fixed annuity block and as well in your variable annuity block?
And what's your appetite? Is this something that you think you might do in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Hi, Andrew. It's Walter. The answer is yes as we are seeing increased interest in these blocks and certainly as
we've indicated the fixed annuity block is certainly one that we said it's not a matter if, it's a matter of when. So
that is clearly something that we are exploring. And as we also indicated that we certainly will look at other
potential activity in variable annuities and other activities within our Retirement & Protection block. So, yes, we are
certainly evaluating and certainly looking at the alternative implications of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And any sense of the capital in the variable annuity business that you could free up from something like
that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well yeah, obviously you see the allocated capital we have. It's at this stage it's at with the markets, etcetera,
lower end. But it would free up a reasonable amount. But you would have to then make the trade-off into the
earnings. So, that's something that we are constantly evaluating. And certainly on the fixed annuity it's a better
equation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And then just shifting over to Advice & Wealth Management. You had transactional activity picked up a little
bit. I think it was like sequentially 6%, but still down somewhat from last year. Do you see that area picking up any
time soon or is this COVID environment very pressured and maybe contrast that a little bit with your record
quarterly wrap account flows of $5 billion in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, Andrew.

Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Obviously the transactional is driven by the annuities insurance and that's been impacted. But we are seeing
improvements. And so, we are certainly that will be, we're expecting that would continue. But it will be measured.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q

And on the wrap side just what, is that sustainable at $5 billion plus? That was a terrific number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
It's, I think that we are enjoying good, very strong productivity and certainly we feel comfortable with the continued
growth.

All right. Terrific. Thanks a lot.

Operator: Our following question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first question is given the recent transactions in the
asset management space and the industry's kind of ongoing quest for scale, how do you see like Ameriprise as a
potential buyer or a potential sale of the Asset Management business or do you think you can kind of stay the
course and grow organically and remain competitive?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. Hi. This is Jim Cracchiolo. We feel very good about our Asset Management business today as part of
Ameriprise. And we are, as you've seen, been very focused on investing in the business, really rounding out the
business appropriately to places where we think that we can really provide good active management both
domestically and internationally. We've been investing in our platform, in our capabilities, in our products and
services, in widening our distribution capabilities. And we're getting some good traction.
Now having said that, we think the world continues to consolidate. We agree. We think that there may be some
opportunities for inorganic in addition to the organic. So, we're very open to continue to explore those
opportunities, but we're not looking to get rid of our Asset Management business. In fact, we're looking to ensure
that we can really have a good strong quality asset manager and that we can grow in the environments in which
we will be in.

Got it. And then looking at the expenses for the quarter, they continue to be a good story. As I think about the
$125 million year-over-year lower expense target that you laid out last quarter, like how much of that would be a
permanent reduction as opposed to something that will come back when we come out the pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Very good question. I'll start and then Walter can complement my answer. So, we are as you know, there
are a number of savings that came out rather quickly because of the lower T&E and less travel and expenses for
people in certain of their activities. And we think that that will gradually come back. We don't think that's going to
be a 100% bounce back because we think we are moving to a world that even if the environment starts to open
up, there are efficiencies of operating somewhat virtually and some of the things that we've done and are doing
versus just get back out to the travel that once we and others have done.
So, there will be some permanent savings from that, but some of that cost will come back on a gradual basis
depending on how the economy opens up and travel is allowed. From that perspective however, we are
continuing to reengineer and so a number of the costs that we are reducing we think will sustain. And even
though we will be probably investing in growing in certain respects as we said, we're also looking for further
efficiencies.
And so we have our reengineering plans to keep expenses tight but that also assumes that we will continue to
invest appropriately, but we will manage our expenses quite well. But in that regard, we have not gone into any
major restructurings at this point in time. We have not laid off people in this environment. And it depends on the
environment we're going into. But we've been always able to manage our expenses while you saw that through
this. And we will be able to continue to do that as we move into 2021.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Walter. Question maybe building on the commentary on M&A in
the question earlier. So, help me get to maybe a little bit more understanding in terms of, if some opportunities
came about on the M&A side within Asset Management, are we talking more kind of holistic integrations are more
sort of targeted kind of tuck-in acquisitions that gives you more kind of product or distribution capabilities? And if
so, what are sort of the pieces of the mosaic that you guys feel like you're missing within the Asset Management

business? So, scale deals just kind of adding to what you have versus more tactical kind of product capability
deals.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Alex, I would probably say, put it this way. We feel like we have a pretty rounded global asset manager today.
It doesn't mean that we couldn't add complementary products, we couldn't expand in certain of those disciplines in
certain regions or international or domestic. We think we can. We're not the largest asset manager out there. But
we do have a good makeup today. And there are always products and services, particularly of a little more in the
solutions-oriented space. Maybe it's some more in the fixed income space, some expanded distribution. Maybe a
little more in the institutional space. So, there are different ways that we would look at complementary activities.
Regarding whether it would be a fit in, you know something smaller that would be versus something a bit larger to
get greater scale, it really depends on the opportunity. I think one of the things that Ameriprise has done well with
Columbia Threadneedle is we've been able to do both. We've been able to take smaller acquisitions and fit them
in and get complementary benefits. And we've been able to do larger acquisitions such as the Columbia deal
where we've been able to integrate that very well, derive good shareholder value at the same time getting a
bigger rounded asset manager. So, I think some of the capabilities that we have in doing that, I think we've proven
that would be appropriate if there's something that would make sense for us to do. But as I said, we're mainly
focused on continuing our organic focus and then as opportunities arise, evaluate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Thanks for that. And then maybe shifting gears a little bit, I was hoping to talk about organic growth
within the advice and wealth channel. So you guys added significant number of advisors again this quarter. I was
hoping you could talk about sort of the productivity or the revenue sort of embedded in that pipeline of recruits.
And how should we think about the time between sort of you bringing these advisors in versus the revenue
coming through? Because it feels like the recruiting dynamic has definitely picked up. So, I wonder whether and to
what extent this could lead to sort of better organic growth over the next couple quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, let me begin and then I'll turn it over to Walter to maybe more fully give you an answer. What we're seeing is
we are bringing good advisors in. That pipeline has picked up and our ability to actually have people join us is
really good and strong. But one of the keys also is how to onboard people and what we've found is that we've
done a competitive review of this. We've been able to bring people on board and very well and quicker really than
many others and get them set up quicker to be really more productive. And we find that that is very helpful for
advisors making that transition. Now, regarding what that looks like, I think Walter, I'll turn it to Walter. But, the
ramp up still takes a little bit because it's not 100% where they start day one but that does ramp up over the next
number of periods. So, Walter, why don't you cover that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Alex, on the ramp-up from a near experience advisor, it's in a two to three year cycle to get back to the trailing
12 GDC. So, you'll start seeing that. And obviously, it builds up after the first six months and that starts once they
onboard. So, you can start seeing that trend line take place as we're heading and we're getting the throughput
coming through for the additional advisors coming in.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Great. And the last, to the last one on again advice and wealth. Thanks by the way for all the added
disclosure around interest rate sensitivity. So, kudos to Alicia and her team for getting it out there. But if you were
to think about the pressure on AWM from the spread business, it feels like we're basically there and it's all in a run
rate. So, just curious if you can confirm that. And B, since that's such an important input into the margin dynamic
for AWM, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory for margin expansion from here off of cut on this 19%-ish rate
that we saw in the quarter? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So, Alex, I'll let Walter answer the interest rate first and then I'll get to the margin expansion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, on the interest rate, yes, you are seeing that the basic steady state is there from that standpoint and on the
sweep accounts. And certainly we'll start seeing the improvement coming in from the bank. But on these sweep
accounts you should – it's built in at this stage, just steady state run rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And then, Alex, when we look at the margin overall for the business, we continue as you saw to have good
productivity increases with our advisors. We continue to have good uptakes of our tools and capabilities that our
advisors are feeling very good about and even in operating in this virtual environment. And as they continue to
really use those tools more fully as we continue to help them manage through this environment, we feel very good
about their ability to bring in client flows and to keep those clients active and focused on their goals. And as many
of our clients now have their goals even tracked online which is very helpful. So, no, we feel good about that
journey. I mean there are always going to be blips up and down based on quarters and activity. But overall, we
feel like we can continue that journey and our productivity has been quite good against the industry.

John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Much of the institutional outflow as you noted came from a low fee long-term client. Have you gone through asset
management mandates to identify other potential low fee flows at risk for withdrawal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, so we had like this quarter there were these two, right. Part of one of them, that insurance mandate we lost
part of that in the last quarter was included in our net flows because of the sale of the business. And this was the

second part that came out. As the net of that, we actually got some of the client proceeds back to reinvest but on
a small amount based on what was transferred.
And then the other one was, it was a very long-term client that had a reallocation. And so those things happen
from time to time. You can't predict those things depending on the cycle that you're in. But we feel again good
about the type of mandates that we're winning. I think lost in this is that you got the size of that outflow but the
mandates we're winning have higher fee, they're across all three regions. They're in good product whether they
be equity, fixed income or in even property.
So, we actually feel like if we can continue to grow those type of mandates, the fees will more than offset anything
that you will get on some of those bumpy outflows. Yes, we always look at what clients and what type the
potential redemption. But I think we had a little more of that this year because of the cycle and the reallocation
and some sales of activities. The earlier part of the year we had a very low short term, one from another long-term
client. So, there are things like that already embedded in the flows this year. But the new inflows we're getting, we
feel very good about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thank you. And my follow-up, I think you may have alluded to this a little bit with the protection. But do you
have a view on potential secular demand change for traditional life insurance products from the health crisis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, I think you saw it very clearly with the low interest rate environment, some of those products that were really
growing in a lot of space previously over the last two or three years now have shifted a bit. And for us, we're very
focused on making sure that our clients get the range of products. So, it's not just what we offer, but it's also what
we offer from all of our competitive frame. But we have seen a pickup in some of the variable universal type
activities that a little more asset accumulation. We feel there's a good opportunity there for us. Whether it's a
permanent, I think there is a bit more focus coming back on having insurance, appropriate protection. But I also
would say in this environment, it's probably not the first thing advisors are looking to sell. And that's why some of
the long-dated contracts, it's starting to come back nicely, but it's taken a bit longer.

Nigel P. Dally Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I had a question on Asset Management. Clearly very strong margins this
quarter. exceeding the upper end of your guidance range even if we back out that $10 million of one-time items.
So, the question is around sustainability. Should we now expect margins, given some of the shift in the assets
which you're attracting towards being higher fee, to remain at or modestly above your prior guidance absent big
swings in the markets or is the prior guidance range of 35% to 39% still a better target as we go towards 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, I think as you saw, we are getting good fee for the products that we both have and are growing and we've
maintained those fees over time. But I would probably say I would still put it back in a range of the 35% to 39% on

average is the way we're looking at it, at which I think you'll find will be a very strong margin on a competitive
universe. And so that's the way I would think about it. Walter, do you have anything to add on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, I think really as a look on average over time, we're still in the 39% to 40%. I think Jim here is spot on on that,

Jeremy Campbell Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Just couple of follow ups in Asset Management. Can you give us a sense of the feed rate differential
between the outflowing products, mandates and the inflowing strategies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, if we're talking about institutional, I would probably say that the relative is probably maybe 4 to 5 to 1,
something like that maybe. Probably, yeah, probably about 4 times the higher fee on the new coming in,
something. I don't have the exact but it's in that ballpark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Campbell Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. And then sorry if you guys covered this, juggling a couple calls today. But second consecutive quarter of
retail inflows, can you give us an idea of what products and strategies are flowing well in that channel?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So on the retail side, we are getting good flows in our income, equity income oriented products in our dividend
categories. But we're also seeing inflows in some of our fixed income. We're seeing it in a few other of the sort of
equity type and solutions. So, it's varied but if I had to pick a bigger category for us, our equities is actually one of
the bigger area for us in inflows and mainly in the income oriented space. And then, we have growth in the fixed
income, more in sort of the varied solutions, multi-assets like strategic income and other places like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Campbell Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. And then just finally, just maybe as a follow-up to Alex's question, and I know you mentioned kind of
solutions when he asked about M&A earlier. But as you kind of look, especially ion the retail part of the Asset
Management equation here. Is there any kind of product or strategy where you have some white space that
ideally you might like to shade in, whether it's building organically or doing a kind of bolt-on inorganically?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, I would probably say, so first of all, I think there is significant room for us based on our performance and the
type of products we've had, the credit orientation that we have to really grow our fixed income space. But we have
a lot of good product. I think we need to just take a bit more space in the channels that we're in both domestically
and institutionally. I do believe that if I look at some other areas to look at, we feel like there's an opportunity for us
to grow our property business, particularly in the UK. We feel good about the mix we have in the product.
But it's not to say that we couldn't add some more in sort of the solution-oriented space or maybe even gain a bit
more traction in the leveraging of our international lineup. So, now within that, there's always some products to fit
in. But I think we have some good core capabilities. We're not in like in fixed income, there are some of the larger
core plus products, etcetera, that there are some larger providers that get a bit more flows. But I think we have a
very good credit orientation in our fixed income that we can gain more space.

Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the risk transfer question and what you're thinking there. I know the
question was asked about would you consider broadening out from fixed annuities to variable annuities. But I
guess my question is, are you or would you contemplate something even bigger which might include your long-
term care book? I think in the past, Walter, you've mentioned the bid/ask spread was probably too wide. But given
I would say recent developments, could a potential risk transfer deal be even larger and include potentially all of
RiverSource Life?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Walter, why don't you respond to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Tom, as we said, we will evaluate certainly opportunities, has to make sense from a shareholder standpoint, but
certainly we would evaluate reinsurance. We are seeing interest and inbounds coming in. And again it does get
back to what is the best interest of the shareholder. We have certainly our product capability and what it
generates is quite good. So, on that basis yes, we're open for opportunities as they present themselves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And I guess just a follow-up for Jim or Walter, and if depending on how big you would consider going with risk
transfer, would you consider a full divestiture of the life and annuity business or do you still feel like that's kind of a
key core piece of the go-forward franchise?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Tom, I would say this, we feel as we've said in the past, we feel very good about this area in regard to what
we have, what we manage, how it adds in to our solution set with advisors. Now strategically, we will always
evaluate what would be appropriate opportunity here that would, if it can leverage the business better or in some
way be good for the client, be good for the shareholder and employees. So, we are open always to evaluate and
we're open to have good dialogue if something does make sense.
But as Walter said, I mean there are a number of options here including sort of reinsurance, both on a product or
even on some kind of portfolio basis as well. And so, yes, we will always entertain where maybe with a certain
partner or partners it could be leveraged and presented in a way that can be good for us and good for them and
good for our clients. So, that's the way we would think about it. But we think about that for the business overall
every day.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up is, the bank seems to be consuming a decent amount of capital.
And I know that's been part of the AWM, we'll call it franchise build-out or an enhancement plan. How do you think
about sort of the capital, return on capital associated with those continued investments relative to, AWM is a great
cash flow generator capital-light business. But I guess as you – as more money is being put behind the bank, it
becomes a little more capital intensive. How are you thinking about that balance right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So overall, I mentioned strategically and Walter can talk to you a little more about tactically, is we feel like the
bank, the kinds of products adding to our client orientation are good and appropriate. Our advisors want some of
those products and services for the clients as part of the portfolio of a deeper relationship. We're not looking to,
like some others, grow the bank separately or apart from. It's really an adjunct to our wealth management
business. So, we're not really looking to build a large bank portfolio commercially or in an orientation of just direct
to clients and adding those type of portfolios or higher credit risk in that portfolio based on the consumers just
coming in as a direct lending opportunity. So, things like pledge activity, things like mortgages and home equity is
attached the things where like credit cards and other things attached to the client activities we feel are good and
appropriate.
I think what we've seen right now, and your point is very valid, I mean right now because of interest rates and
spreads are a little tighter, it's not generating as high a return as it could be in a more normalized environment.
But we feel like things over time can normalize. We can invest out appropriately and get some better spreads than
we get with sweep. We think that we can get some good returns from the business and actually add to our
margin. And since it's on a client orientation, it does reinforce the relationships that we do have. And so yes, it
takes a bit more capital up front, but it's not as though the AWM business doesn't generate tremendous amount of
capital that can be utilized for it. So, we feel it is a complement but, Walter, I don't know if you want to add
anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, the only thing I would add, listen, Tom, you know we generate a lot of equity and clearly we have the
capacity to grow the bank. And as Jim said, it does add basically spread margin to the business based on picking

up over 100 basis points with really investing in a high quality book. So yes, that we are balancing those
equations, but we feel we have the capacity and makes sense at that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to stick with the bank first. So, Walter, I think when we originally started
talking about the bank, you had guided to maybe $200 million of earnings over sort of a five-year period.
Obviously the rate environment has changed, but just wondering if you could provide an update in terms of where
you think bank earnings could be in a couple years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, as we talked about it, that was a different set of circumstance in spread. But we do believe certainly the
bank will make a reasonable contribution. But we are, again, the spreads that we were anticipating are 40%, 30%
of what we anticipated when we were doing it. But it really does make sense. It will make significant contributions
to AWM. But we're being measured about it, so it's going to be a slower trajectory on that one, Suneet. I just can't
give you the numbers because really sticking with this sort of situation, it really gets into what's available out there
and where we do see spreads going. But it is growing and we're growing it and we're getting a good return. It's
giving us reasonable returns and it's generating income and with really very prudent asset investments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Just to follow-up on that then. If we can't get the earnings number, can you just help with the margin that
you'd expect to generate from that bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The margin on a bank is in the 40% to 50% range, clearly on that basis a reasonable range.

Okay. Sorry. So then, just to circle back on recruiting and I guess maybe for Jim, 99 recruits in a quarter is a
pretty big number. And I know cultural fit has been a huge part of your recruiting story in the past. So, how do you
get comfortable recruiting that many people in what I assume is a completely virtual recruiting environment? How
do you make sure that the cultural fit is there when you can't meet face to face?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah so, we're doing a lot of virtual engagement. So when we're talking to both the recruits and both for them can
make an informed decision and for us to make that decision as well. They are in contact with both strong in this
field leadership with the recruiters, even with executive management. We hold a lot of events and activities so that
they can really kick the tires virtually of what we do and how we do it from a technology, a marketing, on support,
our advice value proposition, the leadership, the training, the development.
And so we want people to make an informed decision to join us. And we want that decision to be informed from
our end that they would actually work out well here and be productive and help them grow their practices. So, we
feel good about what we've been able to do there. I think you could see from some of the people joining us they
are joining us for the value proposition overall, the technology, the integration of that technology, how we've
helped people grow their practices, the support that we give them, the culture that we have. I think those things
are all very critical.
Yes, it's always would be helpful that if you're in person you can see and touch somebody a little more in that
sense. But I think on the other side of it is people are still able to make informed decisions and connect. But it is
one where there is effort that goes into that appropriately for them to make those decisions. But I think that's an
excellent question, Suneet. And I think we have all been learning for how to operate virtually a bit better. And we
probably all long for the time when we can get back out. But I think it has worked well and people can see the
difference of how they're supported today and what they're looking for the future.

Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Can you just touch on competition for advisors in particular with respect to compensation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, I think it's always a competitive world out there. And so I think as you look at it, we offer I think
competitive comp packages appropriate for the advisor, their productivity and what they can do in their growth
and ramp-up. There'll always be some people who will toss a bit more money at an advisor and if the advisor
leaves to do the extra money per se, that's not necessarily always the ideal situation. But we feel like for both
what we do and what we evaluate and the type of people we bring on board, we feel like it is a good
commensurate package for both the advisor as well as for the firm and what we can do in helping that person
become productive and the returns that we can get when that happens.

Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping you could provide an update on the current state of the DOL fiduciary rule and
the SEC's Regulation Best Interest and how do you see the outlook for these potentially changing if we get
Democratic control of the White House and Congress?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good question. So, we have been able to fully execute against the SEC's best interest standard appropriately and
that went fully into place. We feel very good operating under it as well. If there's a full change in the both the
administration and Congress and there is something that comes, changes again or comes back based on
previous proposals, I actually would say that Ameriprise is very well-situated in a competitive set to deal
effectively with it.
We have very strong standards against the best interest of what we implemented even before the SEC moved to
what they've moved to. We have great compliance both from a field of centralized resources. We do look at all of
the products and services that we sell. We have very good due diligence in place. And what some of the
additional things that would have been required, we were ready to move on previously since they were being
enacted. So, I would actually say it might be a competitive benefit and circumstance on a relative basis, not that
we would want more regulation, etcetera, but I think we would be very able to handle it.
