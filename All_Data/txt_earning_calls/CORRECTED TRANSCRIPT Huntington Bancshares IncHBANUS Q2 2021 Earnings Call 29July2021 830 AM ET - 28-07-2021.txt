Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Mark. And happy birthday. Welcome, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington. We're
now a top 25 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets. The TCF acquisition expanded our
leadership position and density in Michigan, bolstered scale in markets such as Chicago, and added new growth
markets in the twin cities, Denver and Milwaukee. Importantly, we have number one branch share within our
footprint which allows us to leverage our brand convenience and digital channels to continue to efficiently grow
the customer base.
Huntington brings an expanded set of capabilities to these markets and to the TCF customer base, including
middle market and corporate banking with specialty verticals, treasury management, capital markets, trust
investment and insurance products, in addition to our number one in the nation SBA lending program. So we're
excited by the opportunity to introduce our Fair Play approach and leading digital offerings to our customers in
these markets.
Over the past several years, we've been pleased by the number of independent affirmations of the superior
customer service our colleagues provide and the customer-centered products and services we've introduced. Just
last month, JD Power announced, Huntington ranked the highest in customer satisfaction amongst regional banks
for our mobile app for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we were ranked first in our region for consumer

banking customer satisfaction. Now, these are important affirmations of the considerable investments we've made
in our culture and digital technology.
Slide 4 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first, digitally powered bank in
the nation. Huntington is a purpose-driven company. And organic growth and sustainable top-quartile financial
performance remain core tenets of our strategic vision. The acquisition of TCF is additive on both fronts as it
supports continued organic growth opportunities and allows us to leverage the incremental scale to drive
efficiencies and deliver top-quartile financial returns.
We're very well-positioned to benefit from the strength of the economic recovery. Our accelerated investments
during the past year are driving new customer acquisition and retention, and we expect to continue to capture
market share gains and increase share of wallet in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
On a macro basis, labor constraints and wage inflation remain a concern for many of our business customers.
However, confidence levels are very high and leading economic indicators are positive. Many of our customers
continue to see record cash flows and profitability, driving unprecedented levels of liquidity, which continue to
weigh on our growth and line utilization rates.
We expect borrowers may opt to carry more liquidity than they had previously, given what we all experienced with
the pandemic, the supply chain issues, and ongoing labor constraints. But, nonetheless, our loan pipelines are
strong and continue to build. And we remain optimistic that conditions favorable for improved loan growth will
strengthen during the second half of 2021 as we move into 2022.
Turning to slide 5, I'd like to give an update on the TCF integration. We continue to be on track for all key
integration activities. We closed the acquisition in early June and completed Phase one of branch consolidations
closing 44 Meijer in-store branches. We expect to close the required branch divestiture in the third quarter and to
complete the majority of the remaining system conversions over Columbus Day weekend. The final three phases
of branch consolidations are expected to be completed by month-end October.
In addition to our focus on systems, product and customer conversion, we were also focused on fully integrating
our new TCF colleagues into Huntington's culture. Huntington's strategy of building the nation's leading people-
first, digitally powered bank begins with our people, our colleagues, both legacy and new TCF colleagues, acting
together are the key to our success. And I see and appreciate our colleagues and the differences they make in
customers' lives and our communities every day. We're very fortunate we've a tremendous team.
With commercial banking, the businesses we've added from TCF, such as inventory finance and vendor finance,
to name a few, continue to be complementary and additive to our overall strategy. In consumer banking, TCF had
progressed on customer experience, but now, the opportunity to introduce our digital capabilities, our products,
our services combined with our Fair Play philosophy will significantly bolster the customer experience as they
convert to Huntington.
As we introduce the Huntington brand, our products and services and the commitment of our colleagues to our
new markets and expanded customer base, we clearly see opportunity to gain additional market share to deepen
relationships and to drive organic revenue growth.
Turning to slide 6. While the TCF acquisition is an important part of our growth plan, we remain focused on the
larger organic growth strategies we have been executing. Our investments in digital and technology continue to
drive strong returns for our business. Nearly half of new consumer deposit accounts are now open digitally, while

consumer checking households as well as business checking relationships have each increased by 8%
annualized year-to-date.
Last month, we launched compelling new digital products, including Standby Cash and Early Pay, which are part
of our road map to continue to innovate and advance our customer-centric Fair Play banking philosophy. We are
continuing to innovate with additional new products and features to be launched later this year and next. And
we're seeing traction in customer acquisition and we've restored marketing investments to pre-pandemic levels.
So as we continue to build our specialty banking efforts within commercial, we're seeing strong sales activities,
growing pipelines and momentum in originations.
Before I turn it over to Zach, I want to take a moment to say thank you to Mark for his hard work and dedication to
Huntington as he's led our Investor Relationship team for the last eight years – seven years. Mark will be taking
on a finance leadership role as CFO of our important vehicle finance division. We're pleased to welcome Tim
Sedabres as our new Director of IR. Congratulations to Mark on your new role and welcome to Tim.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which
included closing the TCF transaction, delivering a strong new loan production, and maintaining solid credit quality
as well as robust liquidity and capital positions.
On a fully reported basis, including all impacts of the acquisition, we reported a net loss per common share of
$0.05 per share for the second quarter. Earnings were impacted by acquisition expenses of $269 million and the
so-called seasonal double-count provision expense of $294 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for
these notable items were positive $0.35 per share.
As Steve mentioned, we closed the TCF acquisition in June, and we remain on track for the realization of the deal
economics. Even as we brought on TCF, our teams did not lose focus on driving organic growth across the bank.
We saw underlying loan growth, ex-TCF, in many of our consumer loan portfolios, namely mortgage, auto, and
RV, marine. We also saw encouraging new commercial loan production and building pipelines.
Fee income was also a bright spot in the quarter as we saw increases on our underlying Huntington business,
including treasury management, card and payments, capital markets, and our wealth and investment businesses.
With respect to credit, net charge-offs were 28 basis points. The allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at
2.08% and was driven by provisioning of $294 million from the acquired TCF loan book, offset against the $145
million of reserve release from the legacy Huntington book. Detailed loan and credit marks related to TFC are
included on slide 25 of the appendix.
Liquidity remained elevated as we continued to see growth in deposit balances. This gives us ample opportunity
to deploy and do incremental lending opportunities and securities to support net interest income growth in the
coming quarters. Additionally, we fully exited the capital protection hedging position that utilized interest rate caps,
closing out a very useful hedge and replacing them with alternative capital protection tools which have less
earnings volatility as they qualify for hedge accounting. Finally, Common Equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at
9.97%.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Turning to slide 8. FTE net interest income increased, primarily driven by the additional TCF in the quarter. On a
linked-quarter basis, net interest margin decreased 82 basis points to 2.66%, primarily driven from the net change
in the interest rate caps from the prior quarter.
Looking for a moment at the underlying NIM dynamics, the impact in the second quarter from the mark-to-market
on the caps was negative 17 basis points, while we saw 3 basis points benefit from purchase accounting
accretion. Therefore, the underlying NIM excluding the caps in PAA was approximately 2.8% for the second
quarter. This compares to 2.98% on the same basis in the prior quarter.
As we've noted in previous calls, we had expected a reduction in NIM into Q2, driven in part by a 9-basis point
step down in the benefit of our existing interest rate hedging positions as well as forecasted PPP dynamics and
yield curve impacts on spread. At the Morgan Stanley Conference in June, we guided to a second quarter NIM in
the low-2.80s. The underlying second quarter NIM of 2.80% was a few basis points below expectations due to the
additional impact of excess liquidity as deposits yet again increased in the quarter and elevated Fed caps
represented an 18-basis point drag on the NIM in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect Q2 to be the low point for NIM for the year. Driving a positive trend will be
the additional TCF assets that will benefit margin as we get a full quarter impact of those acquired assets in the
third quarter. Also, the continued execution of our balance sheet optimization program will provide benefits from
our ongoing focus on funding cost optimization, asset mix, and customer level pricing. And over time, we expect
the elevated liquidity levels, that I mentioned, to normalize reducing that 18-basis point drag back down to zero as
it does.
These positive factors will offset some continued spread pressure from competition for high-quality assets and the
absolute level of interest rates as well as impacts from the roll-off of hedges, as illustrated on the next slide. All
told, these changes are expected to bring us to a net interest margin in the 2.90s next quarter. Our outlook
continues to point to NIM stability at approximately those levels for the foreseeable future going forward.
Turning to slide 9. In the second quarter, the interest rate caps resulted in a $55 million negative mark-to-market,
driven by lower rates at quarter-end. However, cumulatively, over the life of these caps, the strategy was highly
effective and resulted in a $94 million pre-tax gain, $75 million net of tax, but as we intended, offset approximately
46% of the negative impact on capital from rising rates.
As the securities portfolio gradually grew during the last two quarters and prepayment fees on that portfolio have
reduced, we now have the opportunity to utilize a more traditional hedging structure to accomplish the same
capital protection objective. Hence, we fully exited the caps during the second quarter and replaced them with $4
billion of forward starting swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and reduced earnings volatility while
achieving a similar level of capital protection. Additionally, we moved $4.5 billion of securities from available for
sale into held for maturity during the quarter in order to further minimize volatility in OCI as a result of the changes
in interest rates.
Turning to slide 10. Average loan balances increased by 9% year-over-year, driven by the added TCF balances
and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolios. Period-end loan balances ended the second quarter at
$112 billion. We continued to have near-record origination levels in our consumer portfolios in the second quarter
with RV, marine, automobile and residential mortgage, all continuing to post sequential quarter growth.
Despite the inventory constraints in auto and RV, marine, consumer demand remains very high, driving continued
strength in originations. The same can be said for home lending, where origination activity is quite robust, despite

ongoing home inventory constraints. The calling activity and origination volumes in the commercial portfolios also
continue to be robust. However, overall commercial growth is constrained by pressure on utilization rates.
Auto dealer floor plan balances remained a headwind in the quarter, driven by inventory supply constraints, but
we're optimistic that we're nearing the floor for these balances. The outlook is expected to slowly recover from
these levels as OEMs deliver increased inventory to dealers.
The inventory finance business from TCF has been facing a similar headwind as inventory levels have been
depressed and outstandings have been near multiyear lows. Commercial utilization rates for our middle market
and corporate portfolios remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Cumulatively, these three areas of
commercial lending combined represent $5 billion to $6 billion of incremental loan growth opportunity as utilization
rates recover.
With respect to investment securities, we completed a repositioning of the acquired TCF portfolio to improve both
yield and to reduce duration. We also deployed an incremental $4 billion of excess liquidity into additional
securities. Inclusive of these actions, the securities portfolio ended the quarter at $35 billion. Given the level of
access liquidity we had at quarter-end, we would expect to grow the securities portfolio incrementally by
approximately $4 billion over the remainder of 2021.
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP. In total, we originated $11.4 billion of PPP loans inclusive of TCF's activity.
We continue to expect approximately 85% of balances from the programs to ultimately be forgiven. PPP loans
totaled $4.2 billion at quarter-end with a significant acceleration in the pace of forgiveness during June. We
anticipate forgiveness of the majority of balances to be completed in the second half of the year with a portion
trailing into early 2022.
Turning to slide 12, average total deposits increased 13% sequentially due to the acquisition of TCF and
increased customer liquidity levels at Huntington. We continue to leverage excess liquidity to manage wholesale
funding balances and costs lower.
Slide 13 illustrates strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. As I mentioned, Common Equity Tier 1 ended the
quarter at 9.97% and is near the top of our 9% to 10% operating guideline. These strong capital levels coupled
with the ongoing economic recovery and our merger integration proceeding as planned gave us confidence to
relaunch our share buyback program earlier than previously expected. The board has authorized $800 million of
common stock repurchases over the next four quarters that will likely be overweighted toward the earlier part of
that time.
Our capital plan entails managing our CET1 ratio towards the lower half of our 9% to 10% operating range over
the medium term. This plan is supported by our finalization of the marks on the acquired portfolio and our
confidence in the pro forma earnings power and return on capital profile of the company.
Slide 14 provides a view of our allowance for credit losses. The second quarter ending ACL represents 2.08% of
total loans, down from 2.17% at prior quarter-end. The allowance includes the previously mentioned TCF credit
marks which was partially offset by an 8% reserve release on the legacy Huntington portfolio.
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance remains
strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 28 basis points of average loans and leases, below our 35- to
55-basis point through the cycle average target range. Consumer charge-offs are quite low this quarter at just 2

basis points as auto and home equity portfolios both reported net recoveries. Year-to-date, consumer net charge-
offs have been 9 basis points.
Our criticized assets and NPA ratios were both modestly higher as a result of the TCF-acquired portfolios. These
portfolios came over as expected, consistent with our detailed due diligence work and we remain comfortable with
the acquired book. The ACL coverage on NPA is strong at 229%.
Finally, turning to our outlook on slide 16. We've provided a set of medium-term financial targets, including a 17%
return on tangible common equity, a 56% efficiency ratio, while remaining committed to investing in our people-
first, digitally powered strategy. These metrics in addition to sustainable top line revenue growth slightly above
nominal GDP will drive earnings per share growth over time.
Our efficiency ratio will benefit from expense synergies from the TCF acquisition and incorporates our
commitments to continued investment in technology and digital capabilities. Annual positive operating leverage
remains a core principle of our strategy. We believe these metrics, revenue growth, return on capital, and annual
positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and are closely aligned with
value creation for our shareholders.
Now, let me turn it back over to Mark and we'll get to your questions.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. So I think, one of the main issues over the past few months has been the sort of the higher expense guides
and there are a couple of those. Now that TCF is in the mix, it's a little tougher to tell exactly what's going on from
sort of the stand-alone Huntington basis. Wonder if you could just speak or provide some color on how we can
feel confident that sort of that guide that you offered earlier in the year about Huntington's stand-alone growth,
indeed, peaking and will normalize from here? How does that play out? What should we be watching for from the
outside to understand the expense control, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question, Scott. Thanks. And this is Zach. I'll take that one. So two big messages I would offer to
you. One is on an underlying Huntington basis, as you noted, very much executing to our prior plan, which has
been elevated levels of expense in the first two quarters of the year, driven by our investments, bringing that
growth rate back down into the low-single digits by the second half of the year. Everything that we're – we're
completely executing to that plan and everything I'd seen in terms of forecasts for stand-alone Huntington and our
track up until the close of the acquisition mid-June was very much corroborating that. In fact, Q2 was coming in a
bit lower in terms of overall expense growth and the outlook continues to be as we disclosed.
And secondly, the TCF cost energies are very much on track and we're executing on that, as we speak. The
branch rationalization, as Steve noted in his comments, [indiscernible] (00:22:16) the systems conversion is
planned. Personnel decisions are finalized. We've completed the – a lot of the vendor conversion, including the
progress on real estate consolidations. So the majority of those cost saves from the TCF acquisition will benefit
2022 with really the full run rate of being present in the back-half of the year as we go into 2023.
Excluding onetime costs which clearly would be noisy, on an organic basis, we expect to step up into Q3 as we
get a full quarter of the TCF expense base. And then, from there, beginning in Q4 over the next six quarters, see
gradual reductions each quarter as the synergies are realized, so pretty steady. No major step down at this point
in our outlook.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. So absolute declines in expenses sort of starting in the fourth quarter, it sounds like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Correct, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then, switch gears a little. I think, Zach, you had talked about the margin going into the 2.90s
beginning in the third quarter. Can you sort of specify, and I apologize if I missed this in taking my notes, but what
would be included in that? Is that – does that include PPP, forgiveness fees, purchase accounting benefits, et
cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It does include the dynamics we see around PPP, which move around in single digits on a quarter-to-quarter
basis but doesn't include the benefit of PAA. PAA will be a couple basis points of benefit, so not overly significant,
I think. PAA, to give you a sense, it's 3 basis points in Q3 and negative 2 basis points into 2022. So relatively
small in PAA, so really the core underlying NIM, that will be in the 2.90s.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
In terms of the loans, obviously, it's kind of hard to see the sort of the core loan growth just given the merger with
TCF this quarter. Can you just talk about, I guess, what was sort of the underlying growth in loans? And I'm also
kind of curious, I know you guys sound pretty positive about the growth outlook in the second half of the year for
loan balances, but how does that play out in the near term just given supply chain constraints and sort of
generally weaker overall industry growth? I mean, is your positive outlook more weighted towards the fourth
quarter than 3Q or is it pretty split between the two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Ken. This is Zach. I'll take it. Just a couple of things I would share with you. One, to answer
your question about kind of the underlying Huntington growth, and I will caveat to say that we're deeply integrating
the businesses at this point. So over time, it will be more and more difficult for us to kind of segregate in this way.
But generally, what we were seeing was consumer growth kind of close to 1% and commercial growth just slightly
less than flat. So overall, it was pretty flat, particularly when you strip out the decline in PPP quarter-to-quarter.
Going forward and more importantly, I think the two dynamics that we've been seeing and we tried to kind of
illustrate it in the prepared remarks, continue to very much the thing to focus on. Firstly, new production is quite
strong at or better than our plan on the consumer side, surprising continuing to strengthen in mortgage and auto.
And then on the commercial side, record calling activity driving pipelines up both sequentially from Q1, but I'd also
say, very, very healthy growth versus 2019. And so, it's giving us a lot of confidence in where new production is
going.
And it's really just a question of watching, therefore, the second factor, which is the impact from the elevated
liquidity in the system and supply chain issues on existing line utilization. And so, I think the net outcome of this
from what we're seeing is probably about 1% additional growth pressure in the back-half of this year. And
whereas at the beginning of the year, I guided for 1% to 3% loan growth, and then, by June, at the Morgan
Stanley Conference that we talked about sort of the low end of that range, my expectation now is sort of roughly
flat on average in the second half of the year with growth really starting to rebound as we get out into 2022 and go
forward.
I think there's some pretty clear signs for optimism here. I think on the places where the supply chains are really
pressuring inventory utilization in auto and then certainly in the new TCF-acquired inventory finance book, we're
seeing OEM production increase. And our clients want to use these lines. So I think over the course of 2022 into
2023, we'll see that $5 billion to $6 billion come back. And the new production really shows no signs of slowing
down at this point. So we're bullish about the future. And I think the – throughout the course of 2022, you'll see
those conditions improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Perfect. And then, just as a follow-up question. Back on the NIM, the 10-basis point increase that you
expect in 3Q, how much of that is driven just simply by the addition of TCF and all the purchase accounting kind
of issues versus the balance sheet optimization or management initiatives that you guys talked about?

Yeah. Sequentially, much of it is driven by the TCF acquisition. But I think, over time, the balance sheet

yield curve impacts pushing it lower. So that's [indiscernible] (00:27:53) give you.

Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
As a start, for you Zach, so there's obviously a lot going on this quarter. When we look at the $0.35 of adjusted
EPS, is that a run rate that you can grow from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think the outlook we've got for earnings is good, given the TCF synergies coming in. Clearly, it's going to
be a noisy couple of quarters here just with closing the acquisition. But our expectation is we'll continue to drive
forward very much according to the expectations with that going all the way back to December of last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, in terms of staying on offense, right, over the last few quarters, you guys have
discussed increasing the pace of investment, write new hires. And we know M&A deals are quite distracting, right,
where you're trying to put two companies together. Are you able to keep that momentum on offensive? Or do you
really need to turn the focus internal to make sure this integration goes seamless as possible.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steve, this is Steve Steinour. We've been doing both all along. The core has been executing really well. We sold
some new products just launched last month on the consumer side. And I think what Zach shared earlier, subject
to the reduction in new line utilizations and floor plan rates, the pipelines have been good and we're closing at or
above budget.
So we've come into this quarter strong and in comparison to 2019, where we had a more normalized comparison.
So we like what we see in the core. And we're, at the same time, really doing a great – teams are doing a great
job on the integration. So we're either on schedule or ahead of schedule. And we've been able to make some
really good decisions around the talent within TCF combining to make Huntington a stronger company.
So very, very pleased with what we see. Lot of work yet to do. But we're moving rapidly. And by the end of
October, the branch consolidations are done, the major systems conversions are done. And we're going to enter
2022 substantially set, which is probably close to a record time with a June closing for the TCF transaction. Really
like what we see. And we're confident about both being able to deliver the core. We're very focused on that as
well as to get the economics of integration.

Good morning. Just a question – couple of questions. One, talk to us a little bit on the consumer side. Like, you've
done a lot, Steve, since taking over in terms of making it a very consumer-friendly bank. Address to me two
things. One, the competitive pressure that you're seeing from either the fintechs or the neobanks around
consumer fees. And how you're thinking about it? Where do you see the most risk? And do you see a particular
risk to TCF's deposit customer base which seems to be the target for some of these banks that are coming up
either fintechs or neobanks? Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, we've been focused on the consumer side since 2009. We launched Fair Play in 2010. We've had a
series of feature function benefits starting with the 24-Hour Grace of the Asterisk-Free Checking product, that's
been a core product. And we build out the product lines. We've continued to innovate over the last decade all-day
deposit. And more recently, Safety Zone, a year ago this time, and different things.
So we're disrupting ourselves against the game plan of trying to be the premier consumer bank in our footprint.
And I think we're achieving that. I think in the last nine years, we've had six JD Power number ones in consumer
banking in our footprint. We got the three mobile apps in a row. Like what we're seeing. We're not done. We had
some really interesting ideas that we'll be working on through this year and well into next to further distinguish and
provide growth opportunities for us.
Now, in the context of TCF, I see a fair banking philosophy just as a huge advantage for that customer base. And
I think from the early reaction of our new colleagues from TCF and the branches, they're wildly enthusiastic, and I
think the customer base will be as well. I see there's a big growth opportunity for us including our capacity to
cross-sell. So the operating processes, procedures, et cetera, we have complemented by our Fair Play products
and this emphasis and focus on customer service I think is going to make our combination incredibly powerful on
the consumer side. I'm very bullish there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And I think we were competing with the – we've been competing with fintechs and the larger banks in our footprint
for years. It's actually made us better. So we're – we'll – we look forward to continuing to adapt and innovate and
yet grow on the consumer banking business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful, Steve. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, I think that the other side of Steve's question, you have
been relatively acquisitive over the last few years. As you get through the TCF integration over the next few
quarters, just talk to us in terms of need for M&A, either in terms of scale or expanding geographies? Like, is any
of that a priority over the medium term or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, our focus is on, yeah, completing this integration well, delivering the economics or better, and driving the
core. And that's going to – that's the focus. So we're really grateful and pleased with the talented new colleagues
we have joining us. There's a training natural absorption that will go on over the next year or so. And again, that's
where we're focused.

Operator: Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. I'm just thinking over the next couple of quarters, I mean, it's always tough with these deals to figure out what's
really going on. We'll clearly we have the benefit of your qualitative comments and you've been very clear that
you're upbeat on what's going on so far. But if you put yourself in our shoes for the next six to nine months and
you're kind of picking up the financials every quarter, are there two or three things that you would say, look, these
are the – you should watch for these three metrics and this is kind of what's going to be good and this is what's
going to be – this is what would be the benchmark you should really focus on for the next six to nine months?
Basically, I pick up the third quarter financials and I'm trying to figure out are things going well, what would be the
two or three things you would really key in on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. This is Zach. And I fully understand it. And frankly, internally, what we're very much
focus on is ensuring we have visibility as well. And what I'm watching is I think the same things you shared which
is the sequential loan growth from where we stand today. As I mentioned, I think it'll be somewhat flattish here in
the back-half of the year, but I do think the conditions will be improving and we'll be watching that line utilization.
That drag as it goes away will kind of reveal the underlying strength in the new production, well, I think would be
the driver. That's sort of point one.
Point two is the NIM, that as we talked about, our expectation is in the 2.90s. I think that'll move potentially based
on the pace of the deposit runoff and that kind of 18 basis points of elevated liquidity drag coming off. I have
confidence in our forecast, with a lot of actions and specific plans to drive it. But I think that's the thing I would
watch secondly.
Third, we haven't talked about it a lot here, but fees are a real bright spot for us in terms of the strategic focus
areas for our strategy and the growth that it's driving principally in those four areas I mentioned in my comments,
card and payments, just getting the commercial card, business card just on fire. Treasury management continued
to track forward very, very well. Our capital markets business is growing very nicely year-over-year and
sequentially. And then, wealth and investments which are seeing record sales activity and really strong revenue
growth as well. So I'd watch those very carefully.
And then, I think, lastly, the expenses. I think we got a question earlier about the trajectory of expenses. I do think
they'll pop up just from a kind of calendarization perspective into the third quarter as we have a full quarter of
TCF. And then, you'll see it every quarter tick down on a nominal basis over the next few quarters as our
synergies are realized kind of wave-by-wave basis. And then, getting to that run rate level of performance that are
in our medium-term targets as we get into the second half of 2022 and as we certainly go into the full year of
2023. So that's our operating plan. And that's really what I would urge you to stay focused on as well.

Yes. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could help us out a little bit on next quarter's expenses, make

quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I hate to give sort of overly precise guidance. But my expectation ex-onetimers that will pop-up a couple

onetimers and then starting to tick down from there.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I'm here. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks for letting me sneak in. Question for you, back on Steve's on the EPS
question. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic on credit. Can you give us some idea of what you're thinking in
terms of provisioning as well? Are we still on this reserve reduction credit improvement mode for the company or
are there any nuances in terms of how you've marked TCF and what you see on credit where we're going to flip
back to a positive provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Jon. It's Rich. Let me take that. So from my standpoint, we've been releasing reserves now for two quarters.
And within that, we're seeing the positive impacts on the economy and our credit metrics are continuing to
improve. With the TCF mark, we spent a lot of time on that. We feel we have it absolutely right. And so, we would
not expect to have to build reserves from here. We continue to expect the economy to improve. And our credit
metrics, as Steve just mentioned, we also expect to see reductions in credit class and NPAs and charge-offs
continuing a downward trend. So if all of that holds true, I would expect to see continued releases moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Steve, when does Fair Play come into the TCF markets? And what kind of an impact do you expect
that to have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, Jon, we'll be introducing Huntington products when we do the conversion on Columbus Day. And I think that
will be the moment where with some advertising or marketing along with the highly engaged new colleagues from
TCF, we'll be able to really make [ph] hay (00:41:08) with what we're talking about here. We have to get through
the conversion, and settle it down usually takes a couple of weeks. But we have such great products in
comparison that they're very – our [indiscernible] (00:41:22) colleagues are very, very enthusiastic. And so, it's an
exciting moment for us. We'll translate that into our customer base. And we'll be launching marketing campaigns
in advance to sort of set up the momentum that we hope to deliver.
Remember when we announced TCF deal, we talked about the expense takeout being half the equation, but we
were optimistic about the revenue potential in this. And it's not been sized. It wasn't sized for discussion then, it's
not today. But it's looking really good. And we have a great group of new colleagues that will be able to deliver
this for us. So we're very optimistic about our future together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. You kind of hit on what I wanted to ask also, but do you have any early revenue synergy examples that you
can share? I know you don't want to size it, but any examples so far?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, I've done a lot of calling. And so, the vignettes that I'm picking up from customers, our customers, TCF
customers, even prospects are very, very encouraging. We've – remember, we have a much broader set of
products and services than TCF. So when we're sitting around talking about what we can do, like, I think it was
yesterday, with a very large middle-market company and they're asking us questions on a detailed basis about
the venue. TCF just didn't have those products and capabilities.
And so, being able to introduce those into a discussion are – looked very, very promising. I think there'll be a 40-
year relationship we're going to move from one of our competitors. So again, this combination has a lot of
potential and the breadth of our products and services, both on the business and commercial side and the service
side, are very encouraging.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Zach. I might just tackle on to that one here, too. [indiscernible] (00:43:16) I think about the synergies, I'm
equally bullish about it as Steve just is. I always think about them sort in a few major buckets. There's the sort of
deepening engagement with products. I think commercial, capital markets, treasury management, our card and
commercial card payments businesses and consumer, all the things that Steve just referenced in terms of
elevated level of share of wallet, given the stronger products and an accelerated acquisition given the particularly
the digital capabilities.
And then, lastly, geographic opportunity for us to expand into the new big markets Denver, Minneapolis
deepening into a lot of the markets that we exist today. I think we're already beginning to hire staff and really start
to penetrate those markets. So those are the three buckets that I'm seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So we're moving fairly quickly, just to pick up on Zach so we can [indiscernible] (00:44:10) this a little bit. We're
ahead of the hiring and we're ahead of the pro forma on our commercial, our wealth business banking in a couple
as new markets. And the power of the combination in terms of just the sheer magnitude of what we have in
Michigan and Chicago is very, very exciting to us. So a lot of work to do in front of us. That's where we're focused
on driving organic growth and getting this integration in great shape. But we like what we see.

Operator: Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. Just can you remind us on your – on the medium-term goals for ROE and efficiency
ratio? Just what your timeframe is for that? And then, also, how do you contemplate what rates and credit you
build into that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. I'll take that one. Great question. I appreciate the opportunity to elaborate and be more
specific. So medium term, for us, it's really kind of the next four to eight quarters. As I mentioned in my prepared
remarks and in a few questions, I think you'll see the deal economics sort of accrue very substantially into 2022,
and they'll kind of build over the course of the year where the run rates, particularly, in the second half of the year,
will be very much evident of that. And then, the full-year 2023 should very much be those metrics. And so, that's
our focus, so back-half 2022 into 2023.
And, I think the credit environment that we're envisioning and the [indiscernible] (00:45:53) continued tracking
forward of benefits. And as Rich just noted in his answer just a few moments ago, that probably will represent
some incremental reserve releases here, mainly in the back-half of 2021, I would expect. And then, on the
forward yield curve basis, really, just planning on the forward yield curve as it exists today.
So you can see that, too. It still represents a constructive environment, particularly as you get kind of through
2022 and into the course of 2023. But really, on a NIM basis, that will manifest itself into the 2.90s, which is my
forecast sort of over that entire period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then just one follow-up on the merger saves. So with the conversions finalizing in October, is it fair to
say that we'll get full run rate saves in 1Q? And then, on top of that, like, how do you feel just about your original
cost-save forecast? Do you see any potential upside? And if there were to be upside, do you expect to let that fall
or could you reinvest some of it? Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Good [ph] additional (00:47:05) questions. In terms of the cost, it's still very much on track to deliver
what we committed, and that's the number we're really aiming for. And it's not sort of a perfect step down of cost
as you sort of alluded potentially as a form of your question. Really, there are sort of think about tranches of cost
reductions that will begin, as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter and start to kind of each quarter thereafter drive
incremental benefits on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Really by the second half of the year, you'll sort of see the full totality of it. There's a few pieces that will carry
forward in terms of additional execution into the early part of next year. So see steady reduction in expenses
starting for at Q4 and then continuing for about four or five quarters thereafter. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I think [indiscernible] (00:48:42) looking at the number. It's roughly $250 million higher quarter-to-quarter on a
growth rate – just a nominal basis from Q2 into Q3. That's just the sort of [ph] quarterlization (00:48:55), if you will,
of the full quarter of TCF run rate expenses before many of the synergies start to take place. So precisely –
roughly, $250 million quarter-to-quarter higher in expenses ex-onetimers into Q3.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
And the base that's higher off of is roughly $1 billion [ph] even (00:49:17) or what's $250 million higher than what?

$803 million. Okay. Perfect. No, that's exactly what I was trying to clarify. I was working off the wrong base. Okay.
So $250 million higher off $803 million with obviously lots of moving parts around integration and stuff. So that's
kind of a range to start rather than a point guidance.

I appreciate that. I was about to plug in a number that was about 20% too high in my models. So thanks for that.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the outlook for loan growth to be flat in the second half but
improving in 2022. And wanted to ask if you could tie that outlook in with what's implicit in that outlook relative to
the commentary you had around labor force shortages continuing? And just to the extent that the expectation is
that, that's going to improve as we look to the fall and beyond as extended unemployment benefits, forbearance
and other stimulus sort of abate, is that sort of the expectation that's contributing to that? Or maybe just some
color on what's implicit in that outlook?

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It's – this is Steve, Bill. You have an environment that is changing, is improving, we hope on the employment side,
that is the number one issue for businesses at least in our footprint. They just can't get enough labor. And so, the
change in benefits we hope will spur more employment which will translate over time to higher growth rates and
financing needs. But it's not an immediate correlation. It just takes some period of time to burn in. And we expect
that we'll see that, feel it, and experience it during the fourth quarter.

But there's also with the 10-year reduction, there's some level of prepayment that we would expect to occur on
some of our portfolio. So we're trying to incorporate all of the changes with the guidance that you've got from
Zach. We're not optimistic that line utilizations improve in any material sense this year at this point. And that is the
– that's a bit of a change from where we were at the end of the first quarter.

Understood. And I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on the auto side of the business and ask if
you could give some color on your discussions with your dealer clients in terms of what you're hearing from them
around their appetite for keeping floor plan levels lower versus history even after the supply chain issues are
resolved? How are you guys thinking about the possibility that we could end up below historical levels of
inventory?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
That reminds me of 2010 and 2011 when the bankruptcies occurred and inventories were drawn down. And at
that point, everybody's going to keep floor plans levels lower and the car companies are going to be more
judicious during the pricing versus volume. And that lasted for a couple of quarters, right? There is a volume
share gain that history has shown that the OEMs want. And they have the ability to push delivery, so not just the
dealers pulling it.
So we believe, over time, the floor plan inventories will exceptionally get back to where they were. A lot of the
dealers, particularly in the slow rate environment, would love to have a lot more inventory. And they're getting
deliveries. And in a good percentage of the cases, they're – those are presold. So they're on the [ph] lag
(00:53:46) very briefly.
And there's still a phenomenon where people come in thinking they know what they want, but they're – once they
experience the next version up or the additional features that are available in the car that – there's a sales
process and generally a selection that still has some physical components in it. So I think the dealers will be
essentially in the position they were back in 2018 and 2019 over time. Now, I don't think that's a 2021 and it may
not even fully be in 2022. But by 2023, we think that they'll be normalized, assuming the pandemic stays under
control.

Steve, before we move on to next – just real quick, we got an e-mail question. Question is, you talked about the
buyback but you didn't talk about the dividend. Could you give us what you're thinking on the dividend?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, we typically make dividend decisions in the fourth quarter. It's a board's decision. We'll be rerunning our
models with TCF data and look at them. Our priorities haven't changed, organic growth dividend and all other use
at this point. That's about as far as I can go at this point.
So, Joe, next question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: There are no more questions. So Steve, I would like to turn the call back to you for any closing
remarks.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, thank you all for your interest in Huntington. We continue to execute our core strategies, as you heard
earlier. And I'm confident we'll drive both near-term and long-term return for our shareholders. We're on pace and
committed to deliver the economics of the recently closed TCF acquisition, while the organic growth will then,
driven by our investments, remains intact.
So we're optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. And I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the
improving economic recovery. I believe the disciplined execution of our strategies will drive top-quartile financial
performance over the medium and long term. And we've clearly build a strong foundation of enterprise risk
