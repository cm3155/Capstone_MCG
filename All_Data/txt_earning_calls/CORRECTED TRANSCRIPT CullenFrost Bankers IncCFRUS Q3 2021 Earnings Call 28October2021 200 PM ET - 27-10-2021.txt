Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the third quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open
it up to your questions.
In the third quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $106.3 million or $1.65 per share, compared with earnings of $95.1
million or $1.50 per share reported in the same quarter of last year, and this compared with $116.4 million or
$1.80 per share in the second quarter. We continue to focus on our organic strategy, while the economy works to
move past supply chain issues and other lingering effects of the pandemic.
Average deposits continued their strong increase in the third quarter and were $39.1 billion, an increase of 19%
compared with $32.9 billion in the third quarter of last year. Overall, average loans in the third quarter were $16.2
billion compared with $18.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020, but this included the impact of PPP loans.
Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans of $14.8 billion were essentially flat from a year ago, but up an
annualized 6% on a linked quarter basis. And looking forward, we're very encouraged about the outlook for loan
growth.
New loan commitments booked through the third quarter, excluding PPP loans, were up by 11% compared to the
first nine months of last year. For the quarter, new loan commitments were up by 6% on a linked quarter basis.
We were especially pleased that the linked quarter increase was due primarily to C&I commitments, which were
up 30%. Our current weighted pipeline is 41% higher than one year ago and 22% higher than last quarter. The
increases are in both C&I, up 22%, and CRE, up 28%. The market continues to be very competitive. In the third
quarter, 69% of the deals we lost were due to structure compared to 50% in the quarter before. We also continue
to add to our commercial customer base, and we recorded 619 new commercial relationships during the quarter.
While this was down from the same quarter a year ago when we were experiencing incredible PPP success, it is
two-thirds higher than the quarter immediately before the PPP program.
As with the second quarter, we did not report a credit loss expense in the third quarter. Our asset quality outlook
is stable. And in general, problem assets are declining in number. New problems have dropped to pre-pandemic
levels. Net charge-offs for the third quarter totaled $2.1 million compared with $1.6 million in the second quarter.
Annualized net charge-offs for the third quarter were 5 basis points of average loans. Non-accrual loans were
$57.1 million at the end of the third quarter, a slight decrease from the $57.3 million at the end of the second
quarter.
Overall, delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were $95.3 million or 60 basis points of
period-end loans, and these were manageable pre-pandemic levels. What started out as $2.2 billion in 90-day
deferrals granted to borrowers early in the pandemic were completely gone as of the end of the third quarter.
So, the problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, were down slightly to $635 million at the end
of the third quarter compared with $666 million at the end of the second quarter. In the third quarter, we continued
making progress toward our goal of mid-single-digit concentration level in the energy portfolio over time, with
energy loans falling to 6.5% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the quarter.
Our teams continue to analyze the non-energy portfolio segments that we considered the most at risk from
pandemic impacts. As of the third quarter, those segments are represented by restaurants, hotels, and
entertainment and sports. The total of these portfolio segments, excluding PPP loans, represented $695 million at
the end of the third quarter, and our loan loss reserve for these segments was 8.8%. The credit quality of
individual credits in these segments is currently mostly stable or better compared to the end of the second
quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
We reported in the second quarter that we had completed our 25 branch Houston expansion initiative, and we're
very pleased with the results. We've identified eight more locations to open in the coming months and that
process is underway.
Let me update you where we stand through the third quarter with the Houston expansion, excluding PPP loans.
Our numbers of new households were 134% of target and represented more than 12,200 new individuals and
businesses. Our loan volumes were 177% of target and represented $371.4 million in outstandings, and about
80% of this represents commercial credits with about 20% consumer.
Deposits surpassed $0.5 billion and were 111% of target. Commercial deposits accounted for two-thirds of the
total. In the meantime, we're also preparing for our upcoming 28 branch expansion project in the Dallas region,
which will kick off with the first new financial center opening early next year and continuing into 2024. The Dallas
expansion will follow our Houston model, and we will employ the lessons learned during our team's successful
rollout.
I'll continue to emphasize that the business we're generating through our expansion strategy is consistent with the
overall company. Its profitability is weighted towards small and midsize businesses, but it also is complemented
by wealth management, insurance and, of course, consumer banking, which continues to see tremendous growth.
For example, through the first six months of this year, we had already surpassed consumer banking's all-time
annual growth for new customer relationships, which was 12,700 in 2019. At the end of the third quarter of this
year, this had risen to 19,974 net new checking customers. That's already more than 150% of our previous annual
record.
We've worked hard to lower barriers to entry for potential customers with improved product offerings and physical
distribution. For example, besides overdraft grace, which we introduced in April and Early Payday, which we
announced in July, we also recently established an ATM branding partnership with Cardtronics that resulted in us
having by far the largest ATM network in the state.
In addition, after over two years of study, we've begun the process of putting in place the infrastructure to add
residential mortgages to our suite of consumer real estate products in late 2022. This will complement our
portfolio currently consisting of home equity, HELOC, home improvement and purchase money second loans,
which has steadily grown to in excess of $1.3 billion. Utilizing best-in-class technology will allow us to provide
Frost level of world-class customer service as we build this portfolio over time in response to customer demand.
Finally, I want to commend our team working on PPP loans. Nearly 90% of the 32,500 loans [ph] for (00:10:56)
$4.7 billion have already been helped through the loan forgiveness process. That includes upwards of 97% of the
first round loans from 2020. Our team continues to put in outstanding work to execute our strategies, whether it's
PPP, our expansion projects, or the enhancements we've made through our customer experience. And I'd like to
thank everyone at Frost. I believe we've got the best team in the financial services industry. They are why I
continue to be optimistic about our company and our prospects for success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.

Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter
was 2.47%, down 18 basis points from 2.65% reported last quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of a

higher proportion of earning assets being invested in lower-yielding balances at the Fed in the third quarter, as
compared to the second quarter, and to a lesser extent, the impact of a lower PPP loan volumes and their related
yields compared to the prior quarter. Interest-bearing deposits at the Fed averaged $15.3 billion, or about 35% of
our average earning assets in the third quarter, up from $13.3 billion, or 31% of average earning assets in the
prior quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest margin percentage would have been 2.27% in the third
quarter, down from an adjusted 2.37% for the second quarter, with all of the decrease resulting from the higher
level of balances at the Fed in the third quarter. The taxable equivalent loan yield for the third quarter was 4.16%,
down 12 basis points from the previous quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.74%, down 6 basis points
from the prior quarter. To add some additional color on our PPP loans, total PPP loans at the end of September
were $828 million, down from $1.9 billion at the end of June. Forgiveness payments received during the third
quarter were higher than we had projected, resulting in an acceleration in the recognition of the net deferred fees
during the quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, we had only about $11.5 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized,
and we currently expect about 75% of that to be recognized in the fourth quarter. Looking at our investment
portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.5 billion during the third quarter, up about $209 million from
the second quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 3.35% in the third quarter, down
1 basis point from the second quarter. The yield on the taxable portfolio, which averaged $4.1 billion, was 2.03%,
up 2 basis points from the second quarter.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.4 billion during the third quarter, up $230 million from the second
quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.04%, down five basis points from the prior quarter. At the end of the
third quarter, 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the investment
portfolio at the end of the third quarter was 4.5 years, up slightly from 4.4 years in the second quarter. We made
investment purchases towards the end of September of approximately $1.5 billion, consisting of about $900
million in MBS agency securities with a yield of about 2%, about 500 million in Treasuries yielding 1.07% with the
remainder in municipal securities.
Regarding non-interest expense, looking at the full year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth rate
of around 3% over our 2020 total reported non-interest expenses, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Regarding the estimates for full year 2021 earnings, given our third quarter results and the recognition of lower
PPP fee accretion for the fourth quarter, we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of $6.48
is reasonable.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW. Please proceed with your question.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Well, I just wanted to start with mortgage. I remember you guys got out of the mortgage business, I think it's been
a couple of decades ago, and now you're getting back in. And maybe just two things [ph] here (00:16:33). Is this
an originate and sell model, or is this an originate and keep it across model? And then, if it's originate and sell,
how big of an investment do you think you're going to make? Like will this be a meaningful fee income
contributor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, actually, this is going to be a – it will not be a sell model. We're wanting to do this to expand relationships,
and it's our intention to keep all these books on the – keep all these loans on the balance sheet, so it won't be
really a fee-based model, it's going to be more of a portfolio model. We'll be in charge of the experience from
beginning to end, including servicing. And as I said, it's our objective to make this a world-class customer
experience that people have with our general products. And in addition, which is what we have with our current
consumer real estate products that I mentioned in my comments earlier, which include home equity, home equity
line of credit, purchase money seconds and home improvement. So, I'm really excited about this opportunity, and
I think it's important because I realize we were the poster child for getting out of the mortgage business before the
meltdown.
But I think it's important to realize what we're doing and what we're not doing. What we're not doing is going back
into essentially the model that we had utilized before which was very consistent with what was out there, which
was a commission-based sales structure and one where technology [ph] and size (00:18:24) were so important in
order to achieve scale with the technology at that time.
What we're doing today is this will be Frost bankers providing this service and really it's in response to customer
demand. It'll be done through our branch network which, as you know, is expanding significantly these days into
major significant markets in the state.

And we're going to – and I think really importantly, and this is a differentiator between where we were 20 years
ago, is the technology that's available today is much more accessible, it's much more scalable at an appropriate
level. There's a lower cost to entry and a lower cost to support as we use cloud and SaaS technology providers.
So, it's mainly about providing a great customer experience in this sector, and I believe we've got a great
opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And, Phil, how big would you like resi mortgage to be over time, like, as a percent of total loans at Frost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Our consumer real estate today runs about $1.3 billion, so it's a little below 10% of the portfolio. I think pound for
pound, residential mortgage could be, at least that size, in the next five years. And I would think it has a chance to
be bigger than that. That won't take a tremendous amount of volume.
Frankly, I think if we got less than – a little bit less than two loans per month for our branches, that would be a
good target for us to shoot for. And in the markets that we're in, that will give us some pretty good volume over
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then my second question is just more about deploying cash into the bond book. I mean, the pile of
cash you guys are sitting on just keeps growing. It's now 35% of average earning assets. We've seen the long
end of the curve move a little bit from 90 days [ph] ago and the 10-year bond yield is now at almost 160 basis
point (00:20:53). So, how do you think about the timing on when you start putting more of this cash to use in the
bond portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, Brady, just for some perspective, right now, really, as we look out into the fourth quarter, I only see
projections for, say, another $0.75 billion being spent this year. So, we did $1.5 billion in September. I see us
maybe doing another $0.75 billion. We're not going to get rushed into it. Obviously, [ph] we're – we spend
(00:21:25) a lot of time looking at what's out in the marketplace, looking at those yields just as you've discussed.
And we really like the optionality that we have. We're not going to be rushed into something. So, I don't think
we've got a timeframe in mind to do that. Obviously, if the yields turn our way, we'll jump in. But we're not in a
rush to do that. I think that if we feel like when the right time comes, we'll jump in. We're not afraid to make
purchases. We just don't feel like it's the right time right now given the current environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, guys.

$30 million.

Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. So, if I [ph] ex out (00:22:52) the $30 million and I would be about, whatever, for the third quarter
around [ph] 240 basis points (00:22:59). Is that a good base, like do you think NII should grow from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You're talking about – help me, Ebrahim, are you talking about net interest income or?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Net interest income. When you look at it from an ex-PPP basis, should – has that troughed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Let me get that. Let me kind of look at my information here. Yeah. So I think on a non-PPP basis in the
third quarter, I think that if you take that, I'd say that really – again, with the purchases we made, we made late in
the third quarter. So, you need to take that into account. But yeah, that run rate, I would say is really kind of the
bottom, if you will. We'll get a little bit of that PPP in the fourth quarter. But if you pull that out, I think from here on,
I mean, you heard Phil talk about the loan growth that we've had in the fourth – in the third quarter. The pipeline
looks good. And then, we mentioned – I mentioned that we made some purchases in September that we really
didn't feel the impact of it in the third quarter. So, yeah, from the way I look at it, hopefully, that was the bottom as
far as net interest income dollars.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I guess, just going back to the mortgage conversation earlier, Phil. So, you announced the
partnership with Blend, I think in the middle of October. Just talk to us one, is there more to it beyond mortgage in
terms of what you think that partnership does for you on the consumer side? And what else are you looking at,
like you've been a little bit ahead of the pack in terms of either reacting or staying afoot on overdraft fees on early
sort of payment for a pay loan – payments for employment checks. Just give us a sense of what to make – what
we should make of the Blend partnership and what else are you looking at when you think about fintech
partnerships?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, Blend has been a product that we have been utilizing for – I know it's been well over a year and it was pre-
COVID. So, this is an expansion of that. And I'd say, also Ibrahim, as we look at the other segments, you've got
the application and the decisioning and then, the servicing piece. We're looking at best-in-class software for all
three of those segments. And it could be that, those last two could be one provider, it could be two providers. And
so, it's – I think it's exciting because it's not often in this business that you get to really chose the technology you
want for a strategy and where you don't have a legacy system involved that you've got to work off of. So, it gives

us the ability along with the work we're doing with Infosys to create the best workflow and the best customer
experience with the best software.
And what I think we're going to see happen is it will take the software that we've utilized for the mortgage
experience, in the mortgage product and we'll see that re-engineered into our workflow that we currently do for
that large portfolio of consumer real estate. So, I think there are some real advantages that we can look forward to
getting in this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just one more if I could, like you sounded pretty upbeat on the outlook for loan growth. Just give
us a sense of – is that growth based on optimism that things start easing on the supply chain and customer
sentiment improves or are you actually seeing tangible signs of activity levels picking up where you [ph] do
(00:26:53) feel like fourth quarter and, at least, first half of next year [ph] should pretty good loan growth wise
(00:27:00)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
In talking with people, they're optimistic. I mean, a couple of additional things, our [ph] look (00:27:07) to book
ratio has been, I think, pretty good. [ph] Versus a year ago, our numbers on looks (00:27:15) up 33% and our
bookings are up 33%. So, it's good to see that those are consistent with each other. One thing to keep in mind is
as we continue to adjust the energy portfolio and you look at that linked quarter increase which was 6% not
annualized for new commitments booked, that included a 58% reduction in energy commitments booked. So, little
– still a little headway there as we rationalize that portfolio where we want to be, still in the mid-single digits, still
an important portfolio. But, as you know, we've been working down our concentration there.
And then I think another thing is – that I look at is, if you look at our – and I mentioned this, our pipeline,
essentially, let's call it 90-day outlook and the weighted pipeline, as I said, it was about 41% over last year, 22%
up on a linked-quarter basis. That weighted pipeline is what our people expect to happen. So, it tells me that
they're somewhat optimistic on our – on what we're going to actually be able to execute there.
So, I'll say another thing. As I've looked at just utilization under lines of credit, we've seen that pick up, particularly
in the commercial business. I think it hit a low point in May. Utilization on working capital lines, this is for C&I, was
about 28.7%. At the end of the third quarter, I think that was 31%, pretty much 31% even. So, we're seeing that
contribute to some volumes.
And I think we'll – because we've had some good execution on commercial real estate recently. We're sort of
early in the game on those projects. And as they mature, I think we'll see some funding up on that. So just the
sense – since we [ph] get that (00:29:30) that's really indicative of what we've been experiencing over the last
several months as opposed to people expecting supply chains to get better [ph] as that has been (00:29:43),
because, frankly, I don't think the supply chains are getting any better, and labor is not any better. So, to see this
in that environment was encouraging.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning [ph] or (00:30:09) good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
[ph] Hey (00:30:11)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Phil, you said you're going to [indiscernible] (00:30:14) lessons learned from the Houston expansion with the
future branch adds in Dallas and the rest of them in Houston. Can you just talk about what you have learned over
the past two or three years with this branch expansion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I don't want to give away all the secret sauce. But how about this, it's all about people, right. It's all about
getting the right people and getting them early enough. [ph] That (00:30:48) before you open up these locations to
get them engaged with the market and make sure that you're bringing in people that really believe in the culture of
the company and what we're trying to do. As I've said before, we haven't done and don't do teams of people. We
do individuals who are making a decision that Frost is the right place for them to be. And I think it's really – the
success of our Houston strategy is [ph] really (00:31:19) related to having great focus and commitment of
resources on our part of really talented individuals to lead that effort and then selecting the right people that have
really executed to create these results. And that's what it's got to be. So, I will say it's a little – probably a little
tougher market than it was when we started Houston three years ago, because some of the supply chain stuff,
some of the cost stuff, people are not getting any easier to hire, but I think we've had pretty good results thus far,
so – but I think we can, and we are utilizing the same procedures in the company and the same focus that we did
in Houston, let's just say that. And I'm very confident of our ability to execute that plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
[ph] Okay (00:32:17). And can we just talk about – someone asked before about the excess liquidity. How long do
you think it's going to take to deploy Cullen's excess liquidity? You guys have a lot more than most of your peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. What I'd say, Jennifer, is number one, we typically have more liquidity than most and obviously, we're not
going to carry 35% of our earning assets in cash. But let me give that sort of backdrop that we do tend to keep a
11

little bit higher level. We're not going to – I'll say that we won't jump in all at once. I think that it'll take most of 2022
to make a major dent in it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Jennifer, the loan-to-deposit ratio where it is, hovering around 40%, that's kind of where we were at the last
low point historically for our company. When you look at what it took to get to a, let's say, an 80%, high-70s, 80%,
I mean that was a extended period. I think whenever we saw the last decline in loan-to-deposit ratio [ph] was into
the 50s (00:33:34) and that was in the Great Recession. I think it took us five years to get back to a – for us a
more normalized number. I think it's – I mean, honestly, I think it's going to be at least that for us, because one
thing is – and as I've always said this, this is a high-class problem, because if you're doing – you're doing job
growing deposits, you've got plenty of liquidity, plenty of dry powder and you're able to generate funding at a
really good competitive cost, because you can generate so much demand deposits, which are very low cost.
So, I'm not so much worried about utilization of liquidity per se as I am just about making sure that our loan growth
is solid, our new relationship growth is solid, and our strategies for organic growth are being successful. I think the
earnings will take care of itself and then we'll be opportunistic as you've seen us be on when we employ that
liquidity into the bond market or frankly, if we don't employ into the bond market. I mean, frankly, the optionality
that Jerry talks about, I think, becomes increasingly important as we see what happens with inflation, and not just
supply chain, but what we're seeing with labor cost. And I tend to think that the [ph] short end is going to have
more volatility than the long end (00:35:17) over the next year or so. It's my opinion. But we've got the opportunity
to take a look and see on that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. Phil, you mentioned that you've had close to 20,000 net
new checking accounts added so far this year. Are you able to parse out how much of these new customers are
choosing Frost because of services you offer, including Early Payday and overdraft grace that not many banks
offer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I can't tell you that – I can't tell you that because they don't tell us why they're joining us. I can tell you, though,
that Early Payday was [ph] obviously, July, the big (00:36:19) overdraft grace in April. And so, we broke the
record for our all-time annual number in June. So, you'd have basically seen no impact there for Early Payday and
pretty limited impact from overdraft grace.
I think one of the things that's really helping us aside from just reputationally what our service and Net Promoter
Scores tells us about how people think about us is, I mean, the Houston expansion strategy has been a really big
contributor to growth. And so, there's that and they are really helping us see increases there. And then secondly,

we've done a great job of developing our capability and marketing for online. I think 41% of the accounts that
we've opened this year have been opened online. So, doing a good job in both those areas in the digital side and
then expanding on the physical side and the geographic distribution, both of those things, I think, it really helped
us get to a new level in terms of consumer growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then my follow-up, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you plan to open eight more
Houston locations in the coming months. Any more details you can provide on this in terms of the expense run
rate beyond 4Q as you build these branches? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
What I'd say to that is I think we've kind of given a little bit of this guidance before. We do have our planned Dallas
expansion that Phil talked about and then also our expanding on the locations in Houston that we've already
opened. And the guidance that we gave originally when we announced the Houston plan was that it was going to
cost us about $0.19 in the first year. And that's really, based on what I'm looking at, I think we're going to be pretty
close to that right now given what we're looking at. Obviously, some of that will be dependent on the timing of the
locations, the hiring of the people, et cetera. But I think you'd be pretty close about something a $0.19 in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And also, I guess I'll mention – I think your comment mentioned that we do Houston all in a year and those will
come over a two-year period, and Dallas will be a two-and-a-half year period. So, those will be coming in over a
period of time.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Phil, one of your comments earlier about the competitive environment and 69% loss to structure versus 50%
in the prior quarter, what's changed and do you expect competition to get even tougher from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I was talking to our people last week about what they're seeing. It's as – I'd say largely the same thing, [ph] burn
down (00:39:41) rates, guarantees, terms, loan to cost, et cetera. The one thing that was a little different that
they'd seen on the permanent side was that a trend towards – again these are permanent deals, interest-only
deals for five and 10 years, which is sort of new.
Haven't seen as much of it. So, I think that around the margins, around the edges, it continues to be more
competitive. There was one – I remember they told me about one person who was putting together a deal. I
guess they were a broker for a permanent deal for a customer and they had said that I don't know what else I can
ask for, they've said yes to everything.
So, I mean, that just tells you how accommodative the markets have been. All that said, though, our people are
optimistic about our ability to get deals and we have great relationships with key customers. And so, you'd think
that there'd be more pessimism as you see this thing get more competitive. But I think just – and we'll – we know
[ph] what to compete on when (00:41:08) and yet still keep our disciplines, but we seem to be doing okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah, the new commercial relationship numbers are certainly good and same with consumer as well. And I
guess that's what you control, right, [ph] this (00:41:24) activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. And I guess back on the loan to deposit question, I know it's not the most critical ratio out there. But it
seems to me that maybe the excessive deposit growth is starting to abate a bit and you're seeing a bottoming in
loans and perhaps over the next couple of quarters that starts to reverse itself and climb back up again. Is that a
fair way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that certainly deposit growth was a little bit softer in the third quarter. It was still 9% on an annualized basis.
So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...it's still strong, but it's not the single-double digits that we've been seeing, the high teens. So from that
standpoint, you're right. I mean, if anything at that level with loan growth continuing or starting to improve now that
that number could get better. But at the end of the day, we're all about relationships, as Phil said. And those
deposits keep coming in. We want them, right.
And so to the extent that that those deposits picked up again, we'd certainly be happy about that. So, I think
theoretically, you're right, if deposit growth slows down and loan picks up. Yeah, that'll kind of take care of itself.
But, we're still adding new locations. We continue to offer top quality service. We're still interested in opening new
accounts. When I look at a 12 month rollback looking backwards about where our growth came from in a rolling
12 months on the deposit side, 70% of it was augmentation from our existing customers and 30% of it was from
new customers. And that's a little bit higher that we've been seeing. We've seen seeing like a 75%/25%. So, it's
good to see that. So, [ph] yeah (00:43:12), I think you're right. But we'd love to continue to see deposits growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Yeah. That was one of my next questions. I guess that 70%/30% split is – I was curious on that. And I
guess the last one, Phil, you touched on it in your very early comments about Houston when you were giving
some of the numbers. But you'd touched on the fee businesses. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing
in – from the new branches in terms of the fees and fee generation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jon, honestly, I don't have that breakdown with me in terms of that for the expansion branches. I can tell you in
the last year we talked a little bit about fee income. We've really had a nice year at this point in wealth
management and wealth advisors. [ph] Got (00:44:05) a little bit tougher in the insurance, but still holding our own
there.
Jerry, you want to talk a little bit about the non-interest?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think Phil mentioned. We thought – I thought we had a pretty solid quarter on the non-interest income
side. The trust side of the business had some good growth there. And with the investment fees growing, I think,
13%, and then good oil and gas revenues there, obviously, with the higher commodity prices that's helping us
compared to where we were, say, in the third quarter last year, and they continue to have new account growth
there. So, good growth there.
I think on the deposit service charges, even with overdraft grace, I think that NSF/OD combined, commercial and
consumer might have been down $100,000 compared to the third quarter a year ago. But we did see good growth
on the commercial service charges with higher billable services. And interchange fee, I thought, was really strong.
We were up almost $1 million and we had introduced a new commercial account that's responsible for about half
of that.
But it's also interesting that we're seeing the numbers of transactions. Debit card usage is obviously going up
significantly and the dollar size of the transactions that are running through are also up. So I that's how we had a
15

good solid quarter all the way around, a lot of customer derivative activity also in the other category. So, yeah, I
think, overall, it was a good quarter, a little bit of softer on the insurance side, as Phil said. We've been fighting a
little bit of an uphill battle there on the net new customer business there.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Great. Thank you. Just a couple of questions on expenses. I heard you guys say you still expect expenses to
be at 3% for the year. I guess, what kind of range are you putting around that 3%? Because if I actually put in 3%
exactly, it does apply – or it does imply a very sizable increase in fourth quarter expenses [ph] of just over $230
million. I (00:46:10) just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. [ph] No (00:46:17). I think it's a fair question, Ken. I was looking at it this morning and the one thing I'd point
you to is our historical growth between third and fourth quarters. When you go back and look last year, it's not too
different than that. We do have some incentives that – some incentive awards that get awarded in the fourth
quarter. Some of them because of the nature of the award and the age of the recipient, get recognized
immediately. And so that's going to have – those awards will happen in October. And so that's going to affect
salaries in the fourth quarter.
And then also marketing, historically, we've been strong in marketing expense in the fourth quarter and I expect
that we'll see that as well. So, yeah, I agree with you. When I – the numbers do look high, but if you look at our
history and look at what – where our projections are at, I think we're right in there. Would I love for it to be lower
than that? Sure. But I think right now, based on what I'm seeing, that's really where we're at. And I think those two
things, it's really that salaries category and the other expense category where I'm seeing most of the pressure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Understood. Okay. Thanks. And then, just the, sort of a follow-up, back to 2022 expenses. I appreciate the
$0.19, totally makes sense. But what is the base, I mean, should we assume, let's say the – whatever the 3%

growth happens in 2021. And then we grow another 3% on top of that, and then we add $0.19. I'm just trying to
make sure I know what we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Well, obviously, we're not giving any sort of 2022 guidance. We're still in that planning process.
There's lot of work going on there. I will say that Phil alluded to a little bit about the inflation that we're seeing out
there. We are starting to see – continue to see wage inflation. I was looking at something from the Dallas Fed this
morning, if I could put my hands on it. It was just interesting a couple of the comments that they were making
about the Texas economy and it said lack of applicants still top hiring constraint, but pay demands are an
increasing concern.
And then, there was another bullet point that said, average hourly wage is now rising faster in Texas than the US.
So, we are dealing with that environment, but we are in the planning stages. So don't hear me saying anything
about what our guidance is for 2022 expenses. But you're right. Yeah. Whatever base level you believe you'd
start off with on 2022, I'm suggesting that the Houston expansion 2.0, if you will, plus our Dallas expansion, is
going to cost us something around $0.19 over our more normalized run rate, if you will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, Perfect. Thank you.
