MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and
CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are Clark Khayat, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.
On slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and certain financial measures, including
non-GAAP measures. These statements cover our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-
and-answer segment of our call.
I am now moving to slide 3. Before Clark covers our quarterly earnings results, I want to discuss our strategic
priorities and cover the fundamental strengths of our businesses, which continue to perform well, despite the
challenging operating environment. In our Consumer Bank, we are growing relationship households in an
annualized rate of 5%, consistent with our Investor Day target. Our strongest growth continues to be in the West
driven by younger clients. We have also experienced strong growth in Wealth Management, with double-digit
year-over-year growth in asset management sales.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
In our Commercial business, we continue to add and expand relationships through our integrated commercial and
investment bank. Our ability to distribute risk serves us well and importantly serves our clients well through all
market conditions. This quarter, we raised $25 billion of capital for our clients, placing 18% of the capital raised on
our balance sheet. This is down significantly from the 30% we placed on our balance sheet last quarter.
Although capital markets remain challenged, our pipelines are solid. On a year-to-date basis, our M&A revenue is
up from the first half of 2022. We expect investment banking fees to be up in the second half of the year.
One common theme across our franchise is our longstanding strategic commitment to primacy, having our clients'
primary operating account, whether it's an individual or a business. Our focus on primacy is reflected in the quality
and diversity of our deposit base. Nearly 60% of our deposits are from retail, small business, wealth and escrow
accounts. 80% of our commercial balances are core operating accounts. Further, 97% of our total commercial
deposits are from our relationship clients. Importantly, these are longstanding relationships. On average, our retail
clients have been clients of Key for over 20 years; and on average, our commercial clients for over 15 years.
This quarter, our period-end deposits increased by $1 billion. Additionally, we've seen continued growth in the
month of July. In the appendix of our presentation, you can find additional detail regarding the quality and diversity
of our deposit base. We continue to proactively manage through volatility as it relates to the macroeconomic
environment, the interest rate cycle and potential regulatory changes impacting our industry.
Going forward, Key will benefit from a well-defined net interest income opportunity over the next 18 months. As
our short-term swaps and treasuries reprice, we will see a net interest income benefit that will reach
approximately $900 million on an annual basis by the first quarter of 2025.
We also continue to be proactive from both a balance sheet optimization and capital allocation perspective. We're
well positioned to build capital and reduce risk-weighted assets. We will continue to prioritize old relationships,
and exit non-relationship business and non-strategic assets. In the second quarter, our period-end loan balances
declined by $1 billion. We will continue to benefit from our strong fee-based businesses, which make up over 40%
of our revenue.
As capital markets normalize, we will utilize our differentiated platform, driving fee income and naturally reducing
our balance sheet. On the capital front, we will benefit as over 44% of our AOCI will roll down over the next 18
months.
The next area I would like to discuss is our exposure to credit in the current environment. Credit losses remain
relatively low across the industry, but as we move through the business cycle, asset quality will matter. Today,
more than half of our C&I loans are investment-grade, and over 70% of our consumer originations have a FICO
score of 760 or greater. These measures reflect the de-risking of our portfolio over the past decade in concert with
our underwrite-to-distribute model.
We have limited exposure to leverage lending, office loans and other high risk categories. B and C class office
exposure in central business districts totaled $121 million. Two-thirds of our commercial real estate exposure is in
multifamily, including affordable housing which continues to be a significant unmet need in this country. We also
continue to benefit from insights gain from our third-party commercial real estate servicing business, as we
serviced over $630 billion of [ph] office (00:06:44) real estate exposure.

Finally, we will continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency. Our results this quarter reflect the
successful completion earlier this year of a companywide effort to improve efficiency. Actions completed in the
first quarter represented over 4% of our expense base and $200 million in annualized benefit. These efforts
remain ongoing as we will identify new opportunities to improve both productivity and efficiency.
Before turning the call over to Clark, I want to take a step back. This quarter, we strategically built capital;
managed the size of our balance sheet; and for the third consecutive quarter, built our allowance for credit losses.
As I covered earlier, we will continue to take steps to manage our level of risk weighted assets in consideration of
anticipated regulatory changes. I will close by affirming my confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
We have a durable, relationship-based business model that will continue to serve our clients, our prospects and
deliver value to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Clark to provide more details on the results for the quarter. Clark?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. For the second quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per
common share, down $0.03 from the prior quarter, and down $0.27 from last year, driven in part by two notable
items. Our results included $87 million of additional post-tax provision expense in excess of net charge-offs or
$0.09 per share as we continue to build our reserves. We also incurred $21 million of notable post-tax expenses
or $0.02 per share. This includes severance costs, refunds on fees and related claims, and a Visa Class B fair
value adjustment.
Turning to slide 6, average loans for the quarter were $120.7 billion, up 11% from the year-ago period and up less
than 1% from the prior quarter as we continue to support relationship clients. Commercial loans increased 12%
from the year-ago quarter. Relative to the same period, consumer loans increased 7%. Compared with the first
quarter of 2023, commercial loans grew 1%, while consumer loans remained relatively stable. Total loans ended
the period at $119 billion, down $1 billion from the prior quarter.
Continuing on to slide 7. Key's longstanding commitment to primacy continues to support a stable, diverse base of
core deposits for funding. Our total cost of deposits was 149 basis points in Q2, and our cumulative deposit beta
was 39% since the Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022. We remain focused on balance sheet
management with an eye towards minimizing the total cost of funds.
Average deposits totaled $142.9 billion for the second quarter of 2023, down 3% from the year-ago period and
were relatively stable across the quarter, down approximately $500 million on average. Year-over-year, we saw
declines in retail deposits, driven by elevated spend due to inflation, normalization from elevated pandemic levels,
and changing client behavior due to higher rates. The decrease in average deposit balances from the prior
quarter reflects a continuation of the same trends. Regular seasonal outflows that we saw in April were more than
offset in May and June. Deposits ended the period at $145.1 billion, up $1 billion from the prior quarter.
Turning to slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $986 million for the second quarter, compared with
$1.1 billion in the year-ago and prior quarters, down approximately 11% against both periods. Our net interest
margin was 2.12% for the second quarter, compared to 2.61% for the same period last year and 2.47% for the
prior quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Year-over-year, net interest income and the net interest margin were impacted by higher interest-bearing deposit
cost, a shift in funding mix to higher-cost deposits, and growth in wholesale borrowings, which in part supported
elevated cash levels. The decline in net interest income was partially offset by higher yields on loans and
investments.
Relative to the first quarter, our net interest margin was negatively impacted by 28 basis points related to higher
interest-bearing deposit costs, and 17 basis points from a change in funding mix and liquidity, partly offset by 10
basis points related to higher earning asset yields and earning asset growth. Our swap portfolio and short-dated
treasuries reduced net interest income by $340 million and lowered our net interest margin by 73 basis points this
quarter.
Turning to slide 9, as previously mentioned, Key has begun to benefit from the maturity of our short-dated swap
book and expects to begin to benefit more significantly from increasing swap and treasury maturities as we move
forward. Based on the forward curve, we continue to expect a meaningful benefit currently estimated at $900
million annualized in the first quarter of 2025.
We have continued to take a measured but opportunistic approach to lock in this potential benefit, and this
analysis includes the addition of hedging activity undertaken beginning in 4Q 2022 and since. We have not and
do not plan to replace the swaps rolling off in 2023, instead allowing the natural asset sensitivity of the loan book
to come through and benefit from higher short-term rates.
Moving to slide 10, noninterest income was $609 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $688 million
for the year-ago period, and $608 million in the first quarter. The decline in noninterest income from the year-ago
period reflects a $29 million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees, reflecting lower advisory and
syndication fees. Additionally, service charges on deposit accounts declined $27 million, reflecting previously
announced and implemented changes in our NSF/OD fee structure and lower account analysis fees related to
higher interest rates.
The decline in noninterest income from the first quarter reflects a $25 million decline in investment banking and
debt placement, driven by lower advisory and syndication fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in
corporate services income, reflecting an increase in customer derivatives activity.
I am now on slide 11. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion, down $2 million from the year-
ago period and down $100 million from last quarter. Compared with the year-ago quarter, net occupancy expense
decreased $13 million, reflecting a downsizing of corporate facilities, and business service and professional fees
decreased $11 million.
These decreases were partially offset by a $17 million increase in technology expense and a $15 million increase
in personnel expense reflecting merit increases and higher benefit costs. Compared to the prior quarter,
personnel expense decreased $79 million, reflecting lower incentive, stock-based compensation, and severance.
Additionally, other expense decreased $24 million in the second quarter, as the first quarter included restructuring
charges related to expense actions.
Moving now to slide 12, overall credit quality remains solid. For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $52
million, or 17 basis points of average loans. Delinquencies across portfolio has remained relatively stable. Our
provision for credit losses is $167 million for the second quarter, which as we have pointed out, exceeded net
charge-offs by $115 million, or $87 million after-tax. The excess provision increases our allowance for credit
5

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
losses to 1.49% of period-end loans. Despite the increase in the allowance, our outlook for net charge-offs
remains well below our through-the-cycle targeted level of 40 basis points to 60 basis points.
Now on to slide 13, we ended the second quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.2%, up from the prior
quarter and within our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to
support our relationship customers and their needs. We did not complete any open market share repurchase in
the second quarter [indiscernible] (00:15:04) related to employee compensation, nor do we expect to engage into
material share repurchases in the near term. We will continue to focus our capital on supporting relationship client
activity and paying dividends.
On the right side of this slide is the expected reduction in our AOCI mark. The AOCI mark declines by
approximately 44% by the end of 2024 and 55% by the end of 2025. In alignment with recent public remarks from
regulators, we expect that any changes will be implemented with an appropriate comment and phase-in period.
Given that, our view is that for any new requirements, our reduction in AOCI marks, and more significantly, our
future earnings and balance sheet management, would allow us to organically accrete capital to the required
levels over the necessary period.
Slide 14 provides an outlook for the third and fourth quarter of 2023. Third and fourth quarter guidance is given
relative to each prior quarter, respectively. Similar to our approach in the third quarter of last year, we have shifted
our guidance to focus on quarterly results. This provides a clearest view of trends heading into year-end using the
forward curve as of July 1.
Balance sheet trends are tracking mostly as anticipated. We expect average loans to be down 1% to 3% in both
the third and fourth quarter versus the prior quarter, as we continue to actively manage our balance sheet and
recycle capital to support relationship clients. We expect average deposits to be relatively stable in both the third
and fourth quarter versus prior periods. Our outlook assumes a cumulative deposit beta approaching 50% by
year-end.
On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income is expected to decline 4% to 6% in the third quarter, and be flat to
down 2% in the fourth quarter. As we derive more benefit from the repricing of our swaps and treasuries in 2024,
we expect growth in both our net interest income and net interest margin.
Our guidance assumes a Fed funds rate reaching 5.5% in the third quarter and remaining flat through year-end.
These interest rate assumptions, along with our expectations for customer behavior and the competitive pricing
environment, are very fluid and will continue to impact our outlook perspectively.
Noninterest income is estimated to be up 2% to 4% in the third quarter, and up 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter
versus prior periods, reflecting a gradual improvement in capital markets. Noninterest expense is expected to
remain relatively stable both the third and fourth quarters.
We assume credit quality remains solid and net charge-offs to average loans to be in the range of 20 basis points
to 25 basis points in the third quarter, and 25 basis points to 35 basis points in the fourth quarter, both below our
expected over-the-cycle targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. Our guidance for the third and fourth
quarter gap tax rate is 18% to 19%.
Using our quarterly guidance, our full year outlook for 2023 versus the prior year would be the following. Net
interest income down 12% to 14%. Fees down 7% to 9%. Expenses, relatively stable. Net charge-offs of 25 basis
points to 30 basis points for the year, and a GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
We feel confident in the foundation of our business, in our diverse high-quality deposit base, the durability of our
balanced franchise, and our improved risk profile. Despite near-term headwinds, we continue to be focused on
execution in 2023 and positioning the company to benefit from the strong, long-term, core earnings power of our
business.
With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for the first question. That will come from the
line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Clark, I wanted to talk about the NII outlook. So, the pace of NII degradation, it looks like it should slow
considerably in the second half, the fourth quarter, especially. Maybe a little more color on the main factors you're
seeing that would allow that to happen. I know you sort of rationalized the beta expectation. And of course, you
got the treasures and swaps, but just curious to hear from your view sort of the main factors in that outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Thanks, Scott, and I think this will be a topic we're spending a little time on. So, first, let me just remind you
that the 2.12% NIM would have been 2.85%, without the swaps and treasuries, which were about $340 million in
the quarter, just to give you kind of a level set. If you go back to the most recent guidance, we would have guided
you to the second quarter being at or near the bottom, so to your point, Scott, it's a little bit of continued decline.
What I'd say is the fundamentals of our business are very consistent with that comment. What's changed is the
rate expectation in the back half of the year. So, at that time, we were expecting two cuts in the fourth quarter, as I
stated in the prepared remarks. We're now going to see kind of one hike and a flat through the end of the year.
And I think the implication of that is the betas will drift a little higher through the back half of the year, and the
swaps and the treasuries will be a little bit bigger drag than we previously expected.
That said, we do think that both of those factors are moderating. So, we're seeing deposit balances stabilize, and
we're seeing the slope of that beta increase flatten. And we're continuing to see swaps mature and the treasury
portfolio will begin to mature now in the third quarter. So, we'll see opportunity as those two books come off. So,
7

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
what we're seeing then is that flattening of the NII and NIM trajectory as we go into fourth quarter, and we wanted
to reflect that by providing guidance for each individual quarter.
As we go beyond that into 2024, I think we'll start to see a pickup. Slide 9 isolates the swap and treasury
portfolios, so consistent with what we did last quarter. As I stated a few minutes ago, $340 million drag in Q2 or
73 basis points. And the way I think about it just in the simplest terms is, $9 billion of US treasuries that start
maturing in this quarter with a basically an average yield, I think, of 45 basis points, and $10.3 billion of swaps
between now and the end of 2024 with a received fixed rate between 40 basis points and 50 basis points.
So, put those together, you are looking at close to $20 billion with an almost 5% yield pickup by the end of 2024,
and that would get you to the $900 million or $230 million per quarter that we have on slide 9 in the deck, as of Q1
2025.
So, again, in that case, we're trying to isolate just the treasuries and swaps and provide as much as transparency
as we can there on these specific headwinds. What I would say that doesn't include is the relative betas or
funding cost that go with that, but I just want to touch on that because, again, I think it's important to understand.
If you look at the $720 million, which is equivalent to the $900 million that we quote this quarter that was
consistent with a different rate environment, where rates were coming down at the end of the quarter or the end of
the year, and we would have had a slightly muted impact on the NII pickup. As I just said, rates we think are going
to be higher now. The betas will be higher, but commensurately the pickup in those swaps and treasuries has
gone from $720 million to $900 million. So, those are going to move in sync. Slide 9 is intended to be again
isolated to the treasuries and swaps, just to make sure we're giving you as much disclosure on those as we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's extraordinarily helpful color. So, I appreciate that. I do not want to put words in your mouth, but in the
aggregate, would your expectation be that NII ends up sort of bottoming around end of this year maybe early next
year, but then does see a more visible inflection back up as, sort of, the pricing dynamics weighing on funding
costs, but you then start to get a more material and visible benefits from the swap and treasury maturities? Is that
the best way to think about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, Chris. I just wanted to follow up I think on the same line of questioning that Scott around NII. So,
appreciate the up the lift from swaps and treasuries. I think the concern when you talk to investors has been the
value before we get to that point has kept getting deeper throughout the year. When we look at this guidance for
the back half, I think, Clark, you mentioned implies negative 12% year-over-year. Give us a sense of just a level of
confidence in the guidance that this is it, absent any big change in the interest rate backdrop, how good do you
feel and the level of visibility that you have. And I appreciate, it has been tough for the entire industry to handicap
this, but any color you can provide would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, look, I think the biggest changes we have gone through the year has been the rate level. So, given your
commentary on sort of relatively stable rates, I think we feel very good about the trajectory we're sharing here.
And I would say, overall, our deposit betas I feel like are very much in line with the peer group. We did some
catching up, because we outperformed last year, but I feel like that's very consistent with what's happening in the
industry. And we just happen to have the specific headwinds right now on swaps and treasuries, but again as
those come off, we think we're prepared to get the benefit of that. So, I would say that, in the expected rate
environment, our confidence would be good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And second question, I think Chris talked about two things. One is focus on expenses. I see the guidance
for flat expenses for the back half. Give us a sense if there is a bigger opportunity here on flexing expense
leverage as you move into back half, and as at least the Street things about 2024 EPS, and also around any
proactive RWA actions. I think you mentioned getting rid of – or exiting non-strategic relationships. How impactful
could that be for capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, that's a great question. And as you put them together, they are closely related. So, if you just step back,
here is how we see the future as all the [ph] regs (00:26:27) unfold. What's not going to change for us, Ebrahim, is
we're going to remain focused on our relationship model, we're going to stay focused on targeted scale, but I think
there is going to be incredible and intense scrutiny around the duration, the granularity, the composition of the
deposit base. And that's one of the reasons that Clark talk about that we pivoted and make sure we protected our
deposits, whereas we were kind of leading in terms of not having a lot of beta.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Next gets to – I think it gets directly to your question. I think there is going to be a significant change in loan to
deposit ratios. As you kind of run all this through your models and we run it through our models, I think loan to
deposit ratios for Category 4 banks, if they're mid-80s now, they're going to be significantly less. And we are very
focused on this. So, keep in mind, last year we grew our loans kind of high-double-digits – I mean, like, around
19%, I should say, high-teens.
And then we were on a path to grow 6% to 9%, but that all happened in the first quarter before the events of
March. And we not only stopped that growth, but actually pushed it back $1 billion by the end of this quarter,
which I think is really, really important. And right now, what we're doing is we're scrutinizing every portfolio we
have in the bank.
I've always said that, on a risk-adjusted basis, most standalone loans don't return their cost of capital. And if you
think about having to carry more capital, and you think about the capital you have being a lot more expensive,
then you can rest assured, there will be a lot of credit-only relationships that won't be strategic to us. So, we'll
preserve our capital for those relationships. As you know, we can do a lot with them.
But we will be continuing to push down our assets and you see in the guidance that Clark gave you, we're looking
at average loans being down 1% to 3% in the third quarter, and down 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. We will hit
that. So, and then the second part of your question, which is also related as we shrink the balance sheet, we're
going to have to make sure that our expense base is rightsized for the future asset base of our company. And rest
assured, we're looking at that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And then, Chris, if I may squeeze one in, just give us a sense of the dividend. There has been a lot of focus, the
7% dividend yield. As a Chairman of the Board – I know it's evaluated every quarter, but how confident are you in
terms of dividend sustainability as we kind of [ph] clock through (00:29:19) the back half into 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, well, the headline there is I am confident, but as a board member, we spend a lot of time talking about
strategy and talking about dividend policy. We manage this company for the long-term, and the dividend policy is
no exception. Our capital priorities, as I just mentioned, are unchanged. It's to support our clients, our prospects
and to pay dividends. And to your point, last week, our board did approve a $0.205 third quarter dividend. Keep in
mind, over our history, we have paid out 80% very, very often. It's just been in the form of both buybacks and a
cash dividend. So we're obviously paying close attention to that. I feel good about it.
Let me talk a little bit about capital, because it's so related. In spite of some of the challenges Clark mentioned,
this quarter we grew capital. We paid a $0.205 dividend, and we built reserves. And so, as we think about taking
this long-term perspective, when you look at our normalized earnings power of our company, and that is the
reversal of the NII headwind into a tailwind, and also having a reasonable expectation around investment banking
fees, the earnings power of the company is strong. We can build capital there.
Clark mentioned the AOCI burn-down, 44% by 12/31/2024; 55% by 12/31/2025. And then, as I just mentioned,
this game plan that we have around risk-weighted assets will be important. And then, the last thing that I think is
really important, and it's going to be important, I think, as the cycle continues to play out, is we have a well-
positioned credit book. And there's nothing that destroys capital faster and in bigger hunks than having a bunch of
10

credit losses. So, I put all those things together, we take a long-term perspective on the dividend. We feel good
about it.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups on the loan side. Obviously, you said that you are retaining a little bit back
to kind of that upper-teens point of your investment banking originations. And I'm just wondering, does that have
any throughput in terms of the ability to generate business in the investment bank? And I guess, connected just
then, your confidence in the second half improvement in the investment bank, is that because you're starting to
see things get back out the door as opposed to keep on the balance sheet like you have been doing for the last

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, first of all, thank you for your question, Ken. It's complicated by the fact that as usual, mix has a lot to do with
it. So we actually distributed a lot of debt in the second quarter. The reality is a lot of it was investment grade. So,
in terms of investment banking fees, not so great in terms of keeping the velocity of our balance sheet, very, very
important. But the premise of your question, as we look to shrink our balance sheet, the ability to distribute paper
to a lot of different places will, in fact, be important. And so, that will be an important part of the mix.
In terms of what I'm seeing, here's kind of what I'm seeing. One, our M&A backlog year-over-year is up. Our total
backlog is down but down kind of mid-single digits, which is really not a big deal. What I'm most encouraged by is
not that I'm seeing things coming out of the pipeline. Obviously, in the equity market, we're starting to see that,
you're seeing that for sure.
But what I'm really pleased with is, I talk to our clients all the time. In fact, as recently as yesterday, I talked to one
of our large clients who is proceeding with a transaction that's been sort of percolating for some time as people
kind of go through the price discovery. So, it's really more a gut feel on my part having been around this business
just for so long.

Got it. And just one more, Laurel Road, [ph] just some cross (00:33:40) factors there, too, obviously with the debt
moratorium and what happens there, but just as far as also being – scrutinizing every incremental loan that you
are making, just can you talk about the Laurel Road specifically, but how you're also thinking through that in terms
of the other consumer portfolios?

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. I'll start and then I'm going to flip it over to Clark. But it's a great question and it's one, as we sort of had
gone through our reset, we've spent a lot of time talking about these capabilities that we need to make sure we
have. Before we bought Laurel Road, they securitized and distributed 100% of their loans. Going forward, we're
going to be securitizing and distributing their loans. We have the people and we have the ability to do it. So it's a
really good question.
While I'm on the point of Laurel Road, the other thing we've done on Laurel Road is we really made two pivots,
and that's been going on with the federal student loan payment holiday. One, we turned it into a complete digital
platform, whereby we can have loans, deposits, importantly checking account, card, mortgage, etcetera. The
other thing that we did is when we bought GradFin, and we're in the early days of this, Ken, but GradFin is a
market leader in advising people around not only public service loan forgiveness, but the whole income-based
debt repayment, which the government is really opening up the aperture for. It's falsely complex, and you need
someone to sort of help you through it, which is a good thing. But that's another pivot that we've made there.
We're getting back to your question about sort of our asset-light model. Clark, why don't you talk about – speak to
that particularly around mortgage as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I think, largely, we're going to look to continue to distribute. I mean, we do have capabilities. Now, when
we distribute a lot of debt, we're going to expand that more consistently, I think, to the consumer side.
The point, I think, on Laurel Road that Chris made that I just want to reiterate is, we never acquired it to be a
student loan-only generator. That was kind of the headline. It was intended to be a full service banking platform.
We continue to build toward that. And we think it's got some really unique and differentiated capability around this
income-driven repayment and public service loan forgiveness. And you may have seen some commentary out of
the government in the past week around the IDR specifically and some of the complexity to that, which, I think,
will accrue to our benefit over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. So if I can wrap that together, is it fair to say that the trade-off of less NII or less loan growth over time
getting the LDR down, you'll sacrifice some NII help on the capital side and then move towards more of a fee-
generating model, just in term – yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, I think that's the right idea. I think we're also demonstrating more deposit growing capability there. And
again, we're still relatively new in having those capabilities. But I think that's the right way to think about it. So
more of a fee advice and core banking generator than a loan shop.

Hi, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just going back to the $900 million on slide 9 at the NII pickup from treasury and swap maturities, so let me just
ask it this way, aside from a change in the rate backdrop and your interest rate outlook, what could prevent you
from realizing that? I know there's a fair amount of investor skepticism around the ability of that $900 million to
find its way into the numbers. From your perspective, how do you size up the risks? What are the risks that you
do not realize that? What gets in the way? Is it more on the deposit side, or is it in asset side of the picture that
could prevent that from being realized?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I think I mean the rate available when the treasuries and swaps mature is sort of the single biggest
factor, and that would have been reflected in the $720 million moving to $900 million. So, and again, that's
isolating kind of the income portion of that. I do think there's a couple variables. So, think about the treasuries
whether or not we reinvest them in the market, use them as replacement funding or hold them in cash. Today,
those are relatively neutral. Over time, if there's a disparity between those three, you might see a little bit of pickup
or drop, depending on which decision we make, but today, it's kind of a push across all three of those.
And then, your other point was right, which is the funding side of this. So, I tried to reflect that as well in my
comments of lower beta expectations at the end of Q1, when we shared you a $720 million opportunity, higher
beta expectations here today. But that opportunity is going up kind of in a related way. So, I don't know and I don't
want to pretend those are kind of one to one type, but I would think about those moving at least in the fairly
correlated direction.

Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, separately, as you continue to exit – or as you are evaluating the non-
strategic businesses and other optimization, just to confirm, any progress you make incrementally on that front
that would be in addition like to the guidance of a decline of 1% to 3% on the loan front? So, anything on the
incremental optimization that would provide – that would lead to potential incremental downtime to these
numbers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A

I think if there were something more significant than what Chris referred to, which is maybe a very active

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
All right. Good morning. I want to follow up on the kind of the capital line of questions. I guess, the first thing is, a
lot of your peers seem to be targeting 10% plus on the CET1. And obviously, there is capital proposals coming
out, but I guess first question is, what are your thoughts in terms of that 9% to 9.5% target moving closer to 10%
to 10.5% like some of your peers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, Matt, we think 9% to 9.5% is the right number for us, given our business mix, if you think about 50% of our
C&I book being investment-grade, if you think about the fact that we don't have really any credit card business to
speak of, if you think about the fact that at funding, we have FICO scores in our Consumer business of 760 or so.
We think it's the right number. And obviously, at 9.2% and having grown it from 9.1% this quarter, we're right in
the strike zone. Having said all of that, we, like everybody else, will wait and digest anything that comes out in the
not-too-distant future, and reevaluate it at that point. But for our business, right now, we feel that's the right
number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to clarify your comments earlier on the call that you believe that the LDRs for the
industry and Category 4 banks in particular will have to move lower. Does that mean that you have some room to
optimize some of your loan deposit funding like longer term debt? Or is that unlikely, given the potential for TLAC
rules to also apply for Category 4 banks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I think that we do have that, and you would have seen us do a little bit of that even here in the second
quarter. So, I think you're following question around TLAC or long-term debt is the right one as well. And we'll
wait, as Chris just mentioned, for the proposed and final rules, but we do think that reduction in loan to deposit
over time gives us an opportunity to reduce reliance on wholesale funding.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, maybe on the credit side, given the ACL was up this quarter as well, was that entirely
model-driven? And I guess, how much of a buildup – is there more of a buildup to do? And what sort of an
environment do you have baked into that current reserve ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, just from a CECL perspective, obviously, it's very forward-looking. In terms of what percentage is
model-driven, what percentage kind of portfolio-driven, I think you can assume it's kind of sort of half and half.
And my assumption is that – just to step back for a second, my assumption is that we will have – I think the Fed is
going to successfully engineer a soft landing. I think it will probably happen in 2024.
Having said that, what I don't think is yet in the market is the impact of all the rate increases and also the impact
of banks tightening down on credit. And I think both of those will have an impact on the economy. And as such,
we're pretty conservative in terms of how we look at things. And so, the first thing we always do is look at anything
that is leveraged and anything where the cash flows could be in anyway impacted by a slowing economy. So,
that's kind of the lens that we looked at it. There is nothing specific. There is nothings that we're particularly
worried about. We kind of looked across all the portfolios.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Can you hear me?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, Mike, we can. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Good morning. So, you are guiding NII down 4% to 6% in the third quarter, and another 0% to 2% in the
fourth quarter. What does that mean for your NIM even in broad terms? It was – I guess it was 2.12% in the
second quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, we would expect it to be relatively flat in the third quarter, and then start to trend up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, my question is, look, that's the lowest core margin possibly ever, at least since the global financial
crisis. I mean, that is such a slim margin here. And then, so I guess, why such a low margin? And even after the
increase, I guess I get to around NII of about $1.15 billion per quarter, which is where you were in the second
quarter of 2022, which is before the Fed rate hikes.
And you can correct the math, but you're using a midpoint to your NII of $986 million, it goes down to $937 million
next quarter, then $927 million in the fourth quarter. And then, I guess you're saying it goes up by about one-
fourth from there by the end of the year, right? So, $927 million plus one-fourth to that $900 million annualized
gets you around $1.150 billion NII.

KeyCorp

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
So, I am sorry, a lot of numbers around here, but in the end, you wind up with a NIM, you wind up with NII that's at
a level before the Fed rate hikes. So, even with the potential to improve it next year, which would be an
incremental positive, you're still not getting credit for any of the Fed rate hikes that took place. So, what happened
with the structural positioning of the balance sheet that leads to such a low NIM and NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, I mean what I – where I start there, Mike, is, if you look at the composition of our loan book, in general, it is in
our view, higher credit quality, but higher credit quality comes generally with lower yields. So, we have over 50%
of our C&I book is investment grade, we have super prime consumer books, so those are not going to carry the
same rates broadly in something like credit card, which we have very little exposure to or personal consumer
loans, which we have very little exposure to.
So, in that regard, we're starting probably structurally from a little bit lower NII, but the counter to that is, what we
think is higher credit quality book. So, I'll have to go back through the specific math you have there, but I am
happy to do that and talk about it offline, but I think that's at least a starting point, but we think, over time, a NIM
that starts with the 3 is not an unreasonable place for us to be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And so, is that right – so next year, you are guiding basically from the fourth quarter level where it stabilizes, at
least the NII should go by about one-fourth by the end of the year. Now, as you are guiding basically close to
$900 million for the fourth quarter or little above, and then you're saying you are gaining $900 million annualized
by the end of next year, so that would imply NII will go one-fourth higher from that fourth quarter level, all else
equal. Is that correct logic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Not exactly. So, the $900 million is annualized as of the first quarter of 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Just a little bit later, got it.

Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

But eventually, that NII goes up by one-fourth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And I said the words, all else equal. What would not be equal? What could help the NII and what could help that
NIM go back from 2% to 3%? What is that logic missing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Well, I think it's – I mean, the obvious one right there is the 73 basis points that comes from swaps and treasuries,
so that's what we're talking about. And betas, I think, getting – or general rates and betas getting kind of more in
line with historical averages or overall funding cost. So, as we just talked about, we have some opportunity to
reduce the wholesale funding, which is obviously expensive. And we still yet to see pull-through on loan spread.
So, I think there is a variety of factors that could improve that, many of which we're either not experienced at the
moment or haven't seen kind of broadly in the industry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last one, Chris, you started off saying you expect investment banking to be stronger in the second half

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Mike, I mentioned this earlier in the conversation, it is based on my experience being around this business as long
as I have. People will defer transactions for so long, but eventually sort of the logjam starts to break. I think we're
starting to see it a little bit in the new issue equity business. And I've just been out talking to clients, and I think
people that have put deals on hold now for 12 months, either these deals are going to start to happen or they're
going to move on and do something else. So, it's based on, one, just looking and scrutinizing the backlog, and
then secondly, just more instinct as I'm out talking to people.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
First question for – hey. What was your adjusted CET1 in the quarter, including AOCI? And I presume that 9%,
9.5% CET1 target would be like your fully loaded target even after we get an NPR that would be inclusive of AOCI
and CET1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So whatever that ultimate target is, Erika, will reflect the appropriate rule. So, if the AOCI of that is
eliminated, then, yes, I think you stated that correctly. So, 6.30%, that level for AOCI, AFS is about 6.30%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So, my second question is for you, Chris. And I apologize if this sounds challenging, but this is sort of the
big conversation that I'm having with long-term shareholders. Clearly, the stock price performance today is trying
to price out some of the dividend fears that were in the market given where your yield is.
And I think a big discussion I'm having with your investors is that, that 80% payout, right, that you mentioned and
that happened for this quarter, it feels like three years ago, sort of in the pandemic, you were getting the same
questions about the sustainability of your dividend. And it feels like at the end of the day, it's really the
denominator that has been challenged. So whether it's been expenses previously, or having the balance sheet set
up to have these receive-fixed rates that essentially imply to zero rate environment forever, it just feels like your
efficiency ratio isn't just quite right and doesn't really reflect the potential of the business.
So, as you think about the next three years, how are you – what discussion are you going to have with your board
to have that earning – the potential of your franchise really be reflected in your earnings power? I mean, the NIM
is the NIM, and I get the swaps, but like, I feel like that Key gets wrapped up in a dividend conversation the entire
time, not necessarily because the dividend is an albatross, but it feels like that your earnings power is so sensitive
to vagaries of the macro.

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, first of all, I appreciate the question. I agree with the premise of it. Our business, the challenging thing for us,
and we just – I was with my board last week, and we were talking at length about this. Our challenge is our
business is performing well. We clearly are under-earning. And we're under-earning based on how we have our
balance sheet positioned. And that's why I mentioned, one of the things that gives me confidence, Erika, is when

we get the normalized earnings power of the company, we just talked about investment banking fees that's driven
by something else.
But what we really need is the position that we have, which is liability sensitive at a time when you wouldn't want
to be liability sensitive. We need for that to burn off. And the passage of time will do a lot on that. Unfortunately, it
is the passage of time, but as I mentioned, the burn-down is 44% between now and 12/31/2024, and 55%, this is
as it relates to AOCI, by 12/31/2025. So, that is the issue. And I think we are – said differently, we are under-
earning right now, and we will be over-earning as the position unwinds and rolls down.

Chris, you touched on in your opening remarks about this commercial mortgage servicing portfolio. I think you
said it's $630 billion. Can you share with us the special servicing segment within that business? Obviously, with
the challenges in the commercial real estate market, particularly in the CMBS market, I suspect your special
servicing business has picked up. Maybe some color there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well, thanks for the question. It's a great business. It's a great business because it generates a bunch of
deposits through escrows, which are more important today than they ever have been in my career. It's also
important because it's countercyclical. So, for those of you that aren't as familiar with the business, we are the
named special servicer when a large, complex debt financing is put together. And so when you're the named
special servicer, you get sort of what I would think of as sort of a ticking fee. And then, if in fact it goes into the fall,
and this is all office real estate, we are the workout agent. And, to Gerard's point, we just set, for the second
quarter in a row, a record in terms of special servicing fees.
And so, I think that will continue. And this won't surprise you, Gerard, but more than two-thirds of what is in active
special servicing is office. And I think that's going to continue. And I think office is going to be – it's not going to be

Oh, yeah. These are very large – think of kind of very large advisory fees that take a lot of people. These are very
complex capital structures. It's not unusual for these fees on a single deal to be $5 million, $6 million, $7 million.

Great. And then just sticking with this, can you share with us, just on commercial loans, not commercial real
estate necessarily, just what you guys are doing to get out in front of any potential challenges we could see, if the
economy – I know you said a soft landing is what you're thinking, but if the economy does lead to more
delinquencies and defaults, what are you guys doing now to get in front of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, well, this is an area where we spend a lot of time. We are – as it relates to the C&I book, particularly
focused on anything that has floating rate debt, that's leveraged. And so for us, our leveraged book literally is the
same that it was a decade ago, it's under 2% of our loans and it's focused on our industry verticals. But we are –
there's a lot of us – and Mark Midkiff's in the room with me, who is our Chief Risk Officer. He and I and others are
laying eyes on this.
We feel really good about where the portfolio is, but anytime you go into an environment where you have
declining EBITDA and a business with a lot of leverage and the cost of capital going up, you've got to pay close
attention. And that's where we pay very close attention. We feel good about – we feel really good about all of our
portfolios, but that's where I spent some of my time, because that's what's most vulnerable.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning, Steve Alexopoulos.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to first follow up on your answer, Chris, to Ebrahim's question. Are you signaling that the door is not
open at all in terms of potentially rightsizing the dividend?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I wouldn't say it's not open at all. The reason I would put that caveat is, I'm yet to see the new capital rules, but
what I'm saying is, I'm very comfortable with our dividend payout and the trajectory of our business under the
current construct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the fee income guide, I heard the messaging around green shoots in
capital markets. But are those really needed to get us to this range, right the up 4% to 6% and then – sorry, up to
2% to 4%, and then 4% to 6%? Or are there other factors which give us some cushion, if the IBBs don't come
back that you could still deliver on the fee income guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
There's other areas where we have cushion, but I mean, investment banking fees are a big component of that.
And we need to have more trajectory in the back half of the year on investment banking fees than we did in the
front half of the year in order to hit these numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it, okay. And then, finally, just big picture view, obviously lot of questions on the NIM, I'm just as surprised as
Mike seeing 2.12%. For Clark, how do you think about managing the balance sheet and interest rate risk
differently, so you don't get in this situation again where the NIM is as low, dividend payout ratio is this high,
you're missing on the NII guidance which is really all tied to what we're seeing in the swaps? But how do you think
about big picture, so once you do get into a 3% NIM range that you sort of hang around there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, and it's a great question. I think it probably requires a longer answer, but short story, Steve, I think you just
have to be probably considering a variety of additional scenarios and being a little bit more dynamic in the
direction and pace of rate movements. So, I think, if rates had moved in an orderly fashion, this would be much
less of an issue. They did not, as you know. And I think we just have to be more dynamic in our thinking about
putting on certain positions.
