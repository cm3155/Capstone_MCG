Kessel D. Stelling Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter of 2021 earnings call and my
last call as CEO. This is the 45th quarterly earnings call I've participated in with this great company, my 44th as
CEO. And I can tell you with great certainty that despite the lingering challenges for our company and the
industry, these calls are ending for me on a much more positive note than when they started.
My very first call was in April 2010, 11 years ago to the day, as Chief Operating Officer. We were weeks away
from completing the consolidation of 30 bank charters into one and still very much in the early stages of
recovering from the financial crisis. I won't take you back through every high and low of the last 10-plus years. But
before we move into today's update, I want to take a moment to thank our shareholders for their trust and support.
I'm also grateful to those of you on this call, many of whom have followed our company as long as I've been
around, some even longer. Our team looks forward to these calls every quarter in part because of the
relationships we built with you. While we don't always agree, we appreciate your commitment to and usually your
delivery of fair assessments of our opportunities and our strengths.
I also want to thank our executive team with whom I've had the privilege of leading this company through the good
times and the really tough ones as well. Above all, I want to thank our team members, many of whom are listening

in today. This team has a passion, a drive, an incredible depth of talent. They simply won't take no for an answer.
They're time-tested and battle worn. They dig deep and always find new ways to win. I truly believe I work
alongside the best team in the industry, and I'm regularly in awe of their dedication to each other, our customers,
communities and shareholders.
On Thursday, I'll confidently pass the CEO baton to Kevin Blair, who I strongly believe is more than capable and
ready to take the helm. I am so proud of all we've done and beyond excited about what's still ahead, and that's
where I'd like to focus the remainder of my comments. In a presentation the last month, Kevin identified three
tenets that are core to our delivering sustainable top-quartile performance.
The first is being positioned for success, which includes capturing the growth in our Southeastern footprint and
capitalizing on our strong reputation with customers and communities. Second is providing an exceptional
customer experience, in which we continue to invest aggressively through efficiencies generated by Synovus
Forward. And third is delivering core organic growth, which remains our top priority for capital deployment with
expectations for core customer loan growth this year consistent with our guidance of 2% to 4% excluding P3
loans.
Our results in the first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver in these areas. Adjusted diluted earnings per
share were $1.21 compared to $1.08 last quarter and $0.21 a year ago. Total adjusted revenue of $488 million,
adjusted expenses of $267 million and a $19 million reversal of provision for credit losses led to strong earnings
that further increased capital levels.
Core transaction deposits grew $2 billion, helping reduce the total cost of deposits by 6 basis points to 0.22%.
Commercial loans, excluding those under the Paycheck Protection Program, increased $212 million or 1% from
the end of the year. Through mid-April, we processed 10,000 new Phase 2 applications for $1.1 billion and have
funded approximately $950 million for our customers. Net charge-off remained low at 21 basis points.
NPA, NPL and past due ratios all remain near historical lows, and we remain confident in the credit performance
of our portfolio. We continue to be pleased with the progress in our Synovus Forward initiatives. By the end of the
quarter, we've achieved a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $50 million of the $175 million expected by the
end of 2022. Kevin will provide more detail later on the call. Again, our team did an outstanding job delivering
strong results for the quarter, and I look forward to continued progress throughout the year.
And with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Jamie for the more detailed financial update beginning with
loans on slide 4.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kessel. Total loans increased $552 million in the first quarter, highlighted by $894 million in fundings
from the second phase of P3, as well as the $476 million indirect auto portfolio purchase in March. With back-end
loaded growth, period-end loan balances were $593 million higher than average balances. Loan growth of
approximately $212 million in commercial loans excluding P3 was led by our specialty verticals, while we saw
declines in balances associated with our smaller commercial customers.
Total C&I loans excluding P3 balances increased $4 million in the first quarter. Despite total commitment growth
of $93 million, line utilization declined $43 million and the ratio remained stable at 40%. With the recent $2.9
trillion stimulus plan, we expect C&I line utilization to remain at or near these historically low levels for longer, as

customers prioritize use of their own excess liquidity before making meaningful withdrawals. Returning to a more
normalized average of 46% would add approximately $650 million in funded balances.
Total CRE loans increased $208 million, as the recovery of commercial real estate markets continues. Total
consumer loans, excluding lending partnerships, declined $333 million. The reductions are a continuation of the
post-COVID trends witnessed across the industry as consumers use government stimulus to reduce revolving
credit balances and deleverage. This trend was particularly apparent within our consumer mortgage and HELOC
portfolios, which declined $214 million and $105 million respectively.
We continue to deliver on the P3 program for our customers. We have processed $1.1 billion of P3 loans and
funded approximately $950 million to-date as part of the second phase of the program. We also continue to work
through the forgiveness process on Phase 1 loans. In the first quarter, we had $711 million of loans complete the
forgiveness process.
Total P3 loans ended the quarter at $2.4 billion. More details related to these loans are available in the appendix.
Total lending partnership loans held for investment increased $503 million, led by the purchase of prime auto
loans. We will continue to use lending partnerships as a strategy to manage the balance sheet, which I'll discuss
further in the capital and liquidity sections.
As shown on slide 5, we had total deposit growth of $677 million. The main drivers of the change include the
deposits associated with Phase 2 of P3, the clients and public funds, and continued remixing of our deposit base.
Deposit growth was led by an increase in core non-interest bearing deposits of $1.4 billion, allowing the continued
strategic run-off of higher cost deposits.
The more favorable mix supports further declines in the total cost of deposits, which declined another 6 basis
points in the quarter to 0.22%. At the end of the quarter, total non-interest bearing deposits accounted for 31% of
total deposits, which improves our cost of deposits and NII sensitivity. The cost of money market deposits fell by 3
basis points, and we will continue to manage these costs down in this low-rate environment.
In the first quarter, we were able to reduce the cost of time deposits by 24 basis points to 0.89%. The reduction
then included a 19% decline in brokered TDs, which included $309 million at an average rate of approximately
1.85%. Further reductions in deposit costs will come from time deposit maturities, as well as further price
reductions in non-maturity deposits.
Slide 6 shows net interest income of $374 million or $349 million excluding P3 fee accretion. Those figures
represent a $12 million decrease from the fourth quarter, largely due to lower day count and the continuation of
low-rate pressure. This includes a greater-than-expected increase in refinance activity and higher premium
amortization within the securities portfolio. These headwinds were partially offset by lower deposit costs and the
continued deployment of excess liquidity.
In addition to the increase in lending partnerships, the $503 million I referenced earlier, we increased the size of
the securities book by $1 billion. In the first quarter, we realized $25 million in P3 fees. At quarter-end, the net
unrealized fees were $25 million for Phase 1 and $36 million for Phase 2. We expect most of the remaining Phase
1 fee accretion will occur in the second quarter and Phase 2 fee accretion will pick up in the second half of the
year. As a reminder, most Phase 1 loans have a two-year term. It's a five-year term for Phase 2 loans.
Securities accounted for approximately 16% of total assets at the end of the quarter, and we continue to expect
further growth within that portfolio for the foreseeable future to deploy excess liquidity. Based on current market

conditions and our loan growth expectations, we reiterate our expectation that our core NII should trough in the
first quarter exclusive of accelerated P3 fee accretion.
As we progress through the year, we expect to see increases in NII, driven by loan growth, deployment of
liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions. The net interest margin was 3.04%,
down 8 basis points from the previous quarter. We will continuously monitor our forecasted liquidity position as we
consider the appropriate size and composition of our securities and lending partnership portfolios.
Slide 7 shows noninterest revenue of $111 million. After adjusting for security losses, adjusted non-interest
revenue was $113 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter and $14 million from the prior year. Core banking
revenues increased $1 million, as a $2 million increase in account analysis fees following the first wave of our
Pricing for Value initiative offset declines in NSF fees of $1 million.
Increased customer derivative activity and interest rate movement contributed to a capital markets improvement
of $3 million. We saw continued growth in assets under management, which were up 2% quarter-over-quarter and
35% year-over-year. Net mortgage revenue of $22 million remained strong, although we're seeing some
normalization in activity from the extended low-rate environment. While first quarter mortgage production levels
remained elevated, the recent increase in interest rates is likely to reduce production levels going forward.
Moving on to noninterest expense on slide 8, total and adjusted noninterest expenses were $267 million. Adjusted
NIE was down $9 million from the prior quarter and $5 million from the prior year. The employment expense
increase of $8 million from the prior quarter includes seasonal first quarter increases in employment taxes and
other related employment expenses that were partially offset by the benefit of Synovus Forward initiatives,
including a full quarter benefit of the voluntary early retirement program last quarter.
Professional fees declined $8 million from the prior quarter primarily from lower expenses associated with
Synovus Forward, P3 and CARES Act-related initiatives. Kevin will share an update on our Synovus Forward
progress shortly. We remain committed to prudent expense management, enabling us to continue investing in
areas that position us for greater success, deliver a superior customer experience and promote profitable growth.
We remain confident in the credit performance of our loan portfolio. As you can see on slide 9, key credit metrics
remain stable with NPA, NPL and past dues all remaining near historical lows. I'd further note that our allowance
estimates show reduced life-of-loan losses versus the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined $2 million to $20
million or 21 basis points. Given elevated levels of liquidity and continued economic recovery, particularly in the
Southeast, we are not expecting a significant change in net charge-offs in the near term.
The $19 million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted from the improved economic outlook and stable
loan portfolio metrics that were partially offset by the increased size of the loan portfolio. As expected, we saw an
increase in criticized and classified loans that reflects the timing from our grading process, which uses trailing
quarterly financial statements and reflects the lower levels of revenue experienced during the pandemic.
Approximately 60% of the $263 million increase is hospitality-related, including hotels and full-service restaurants.
The most recent cash inflow data, which is located in the appendix, shows positive momentum in year-over-year
activity. We expect to see a significant reduction in criticized and classified levels as the real-time improvements
we're seeing in cash inflows, which serve as a proxy for revenues, translates into improved quarterly financial
statements for borrowers.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
This more positive outlook is reflected in the ending ACL ratio of 1.69% excluding P3 loans. It is the first quarterly
decline since implementing CECL over a year ago. The decrease aligns with the more positive economic outlook
and reduced uncertainty. The allowance at the end of the quarter incorporates an outlook with moderate
economic expansion and benefits from the recently approved stimulus. There is more detail included in the
appendix.
As noted on slide 10, the CET1 ratio increased 8 basis points to 9.74% from strong core earnings despite a risk-
weighted asset increase of $1.2 billion. The RWA increase is primarily from balance sheet management efforts I
referenced earlier, as well as a $234 million increase in loans held for sale. The CET1 ratio grew more than 100
basis points over the past year, and we remain above the top end of our 9% to 9.5% operating range for CET1.
We are well-positioned to complete our key strategic objectives, including our commitment to profitable growth.
Our top priority is to deploy our balance sheet to core multi-solution relationships. We also believe it's important to
return a portion of current earnings through dividends, targeting a long-term payout ratio of 30% to 40%. When we
are comfortable that our capital is sufficient to cover our primary objectives, we consider secondary priorities like
share repurchases and noncore growth.
Before handing it over to Kevin, I'd like to highlight the active balance sheet management efforts we've taken
shown on slide 11, because that goes hand in hand with our ability to deploy excess liquidity as well as capital
above the top end of our operating range. The first graph is a historical view of our cash position to give a sense
for where normalized operating levels were pre-COVID. We've talked about the impact on NIM, but there's also
the opportunity cost of not deploying that liquidity.
Current interest-bearing funds with the Federal Reserve of $2.7 billion are about 3.5 times higher than normalized
levels, and we've actively managed our balance sheet the past few quarters to monetize that excess liquidity. One
way we were able to accomplish this was our lending partnership portfolio, which a year ago had approximately
$2 billion in held for investment loans. With our actions in restructuring the GreenSky relationship and active
management of the other lending partnership portfolios, our total lending partnership exposure at quarter-end was
$1.9 billion with approximately $1.2 billion in held for investment loans and approximately $700 million in held for
sale loans.
We will continue to manage this portfolio as we navigate the current capital and liquidity environment. In the first
quarter, we purchased auto loans because we believe that the risk/return profile, two-year average life and the
auto loan market liquidity was a good fit under current market conditions. As you can see in the third graph, we
also increased our securities as a percentage of total assets. The yield on first quarter purchases was about
1.4%.
The last graph is a historical view of the loan-to-deposit ratio, which currently stands at 82%. This provides
significant longer term opportunities highlighted by the ability to be more selective and efficient with our funding,
which you've seen us actively manage over the past year. This includes deposits and other liabilities.
With excess liquidity and capital above the high end of our targeted operating range, we can increase assets
including securities and loans, which results in much higher yields than the overnight rates with the Federal
Reserve. We can accomplish this without sacrificing core organic loan growth, our highest priority for capital and
liquidity deployment.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some comments about our strategies and provide an update on
Synovus Forward.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'd like to begin by thanking Kessel for all of his contributions that have helped transform
Synovus and position us very well for the future. The entire Synovus leadership team and I sincerely appreciate
the unwavering support and especially skillful and influential leadership Kessel has provided as CEO, and we're
grateful he'll remain in the mix in his role as the Executive Chairman of the Board.
Kessel and I have worked very closely together since I joined the company in 2016. He's taught me and our entire
team a lot as we've watched and listened to him steer us through challenges no one ever dreamed we'd face. It's
certainly an honor to take the helm of this incredible company as we continue to build on the strong foundation
that is part of his legacy.
As Kessel stated during his introduction, we have been working intently not only to perform in the present, but
also building upon our core foundations and further transforming the company to be in a position to deliver
sustainable top-quartile growth. Slide 12 provides a basis for which we believe creates a compelling formula for
our ability to achieve and sustain our top-quartile objectives. It begins with being positioned for success, which is
a combination of the longevity and resulting value of a strong core franchise, as well as the more recent
transformation of the company.
In the appendix, we've included a timeline with a series of highlights under Kessel's tenure as CEO. We certainly
don't have time today to discuss all of the accomplishments and transformation over the last 11 years spanning
the four phases of stabilize, rebuild, invest and accelerate. However, I want to highlight a couple of imperatives
that have been instrumental in better positioning Synovus for scalable growth and winning in the marketplace.
During this timeframe, we moved to a more centralized banking model without impacting our agility and customer
connectivity that has long been a staple of Synovus. We built out robust and comprehensive risk management
procedures and practices, while strengthening and diversifying the balance sheet to better withstand periods of
stress. And lastly, we have enhanced our products and solutions as well as expanded our coverage through the
addition of talent and through the Global One and Florida Community Bank acquisitions. As we evaluate our
performance over the prior 12 months, these previous initiatives and efforts have been essential in helping to
weather and overcome the challenges of the economic downturn, while continuing to strengthen the bank for the
future.
Synovus is well-positioned competitively within our industry. We are large enough and aligned with the right
fintechs and partners to deliver the capabilities and functionality of our largest bank competitors. We have also
doubled down on remaining local and focusing on delivering a personalized approach to banking, which competes
well with the smaller institutions. Lastly, we have solid coverage across our markets, customer segments and
industries, but we continue to have opportunities to expand our asset classes, products and solutions, and talent
base.
We also believe we're in the best footprint in banking. This belief is strongly supported by the demographic and
economic data as we evaluate relative comparisons of metrics such as GDP, employment rates, home prices and
many others. Our five-state footprint is performing at levels far better than the national averages, and we believe
this trend will continue and will likely become more pronounced with population and business flows into our
markets.
In addition, our capital levels have increased significantly throughout 2020 and into 2021, and we have
demonstrated prudence given the unprecedented changes in the underlying economic environment. And we are

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
now in a position to fully utilize our capital to support the organic growth as our current capital levels are in excess
of our stated target levels.
In addition to being well-positioned, we fully understand the importance of and are committed to delivering a
superior customer experience. The industry attempts to make this more complex than it really is. It is all about
making it easier to do business with us, and through our actions over time building a strong level of trust with our
customers. We accomplish this by putting their interest first and partnering with them as advisors.
We have a long and successful track record with high levels of customer loyalty, as evidenced by our Net
Promoter Scores. But we know there's an opportunity to continue to improve. We are redesigning customer
processes and leveraging technology to further strengthen relationships with a model of high-tech meeting high-
touch, with our highly engaged and experienced team members serving as a key point of differentiation. It is not
about addition by subtraction, but rather building synergies from the combination of both aspects.
The line between service and sales is also becoming blurred. Customers want advice and guidance, and they
expect their financial partners to provide it in a proactive manner in order to support their financial objectives. We
are prioritizing investment in data and analytics, as well as the channels that support customer interactions in
order to be more proactive and timely in providing insights and advice. Not only is it leading to creating longer
term sticky relationships, but it is also generating new sources of revenue, which brings me to our third area of
focus, profitable growth.
Jamie summarized our capital priorities well, as we will continue to prioritize core organic growth as our primary
objective. Given the strength of the economic activity in our footprint and our calling activities, we are starting to
see pipelines and production levels return to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect the second half of 2021
to be the strongest in terms of growth.
We have also had a concerted strategy to accelerate the growth in our fee income generation businesses,
including wealth management, treasury and payment solutions, and capital markets. The first quarter results
continue to show good momentum in these areas with increases in wealth management revenues, up $2 million
or 5% from the fourth quarter, as well as AUM continuing to grow, as Jamie referenced earlier.
Treasury and payment solutions overall production and onboarding efforts continue to hit record levels, combined
with the repricing efforts produced a $2 million or 23% increase in service charges versus the fourth quarter
despite increases in customer liquidity. And lastly, the addition of key talent will serve as a catalyst for growth.
Synovus continues to be a model that is attracting top talent. We continue to double down on businesses where
we have the right to win and present the opportunity for profitable growth.
We have increased the producing team members in our wholesale and specialty banking units, treasury and
payment solutions, as well as wealth management. Ongoing disruption in the industry, as well as a targeted
approach for expansion will allow us to opportunistically add top talent in areas where we continue to see
relatively short payback periods and sources of long-term growth.
Moving to slide 13, this outlines our Synovus Forward initiatives, which we've shared previously. We are confident
these initiatives will help us achieve our stated objectives and align with the three tenets that Kessel outlined
earlier. As a reminder, we expect to achieve a pre-tax run rate benefit of $175 million by the end of 2022. We
prioritized efficiency initiatives as we kicked off the program in late 2019 in order to fund our journey forward, and
these initiatives will result in approximately half of the $175 million anticipated pre-tax benefit.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
At the end of the first quarter, we have achieved a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $50 million, with about
$40 million in cost reductions and $10 million in incremental revenues. We are in the process of realizing the
additional Phase 1 efficiency initiatives and announced in January that we expect to generate an additional $25
million in Phase 2. We have initiated the Phase 2 program, and over the next two quarters, we will begin to make
decisions that will lead to the incremental savings with the goal to have all of the efficiency programs executed by
the fourth quarter of 2022.
As we continue executing the Synovus Forward plan, the mix of benefits will shift towards revenues. As such, we
are very pleased with the progress we've made in both our commercial analytics and Pricing for Value revenue
initiatives. We are currently in the pilot phase of our commercial analytics enhancements, which include the
SMART tool that I detailed on our previous earnings call. Our team is now receiving and closing actionable leads
from this tool, and you'll begin to see the benefits in both net interest and non-interest revenue lines going
forward.
The SMART tool will be fully adopted and in production by the third quarter of this year. We remain confident in
our ability to generate a pre-tax run rate benefit of over $20 million by the end of the year. We are also in the initial
phases of developing a similar tool to be leveraged by our retail and wealth management bankers, and expect to
have a program in place by year-end.
Our Pricing for Value initiative in treasury and payment solutions began in the fourth quarter and will continue
through the second quarter of 2021. Results to-date have exceeded our expectations with fees increasing $2
million quarter-over-quarter, and we expect to maintain and even increase profitability in these products as we
continue to increase our value proposition in treasury and payment solutions, including our new Synovus
Gateway platform, priority service and enhanced solutions.
Delving deeper into our focus on expanding our products and solutions, sales in our new merchant solution
continue to outpace our expectations and we are turning our attention to rolling out additional functionality and
capabilities in 2021, including international export financing, integrated payables and receivables, and a one card
digital wallet solution. To achieve sustainable top-quartile growth, we understand that continued investments in
technology and talent are paramount.
As we evaluate the need to balance short-term headwinds from interest rates or economic activity, we have
emphasized not making short-term decisions that impact our long-term valuation or growth opportunities. As such,
it requires more rigorous prioritization and focusing more intently on businesses where we have the right and
proven track record of winning. Synovus Forward is predicated on supporting our aspirations as a growth bank
and not simply cutting our way to prosperity.
Now, before I turn it back over to Q&A, I want to make a couple final comments regarding the CEO transition.
Since our announcement in December, we've been asked a lot about how the strategies will be changing under
new leadership. While there'll be some changes over time, like Kessel, I will continue to execute the Synovus
Forward plan. We have both been aligned with the company's direction and areas of emphasis outlined in
Synovus Forward and our other strategic initiatives.
We are both clear on our strengths as well as our opportunities for improvement. Also, we both have a lot of
confidence in the Synovus team and our ability to win versus the largest and smallest competitors. And lastly, we
are both committed to lead our company forward to deliver on both our short and long-term objectives, while not
losing sight of what makes Synovus a great company, its team members, its customers and the communities we
serve.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess first and foremost, congratulations on pulling off what has been one of the most remarkable turnarounds
in banks post-financial crisis. So, job well done. And I guess in terms of the question, I'm just trying to reconcile
what Jamie talked about in terms of loan growth and the impact from stimulus and savings both on the
commercial and consumer side. And I think, Kevin, you mentioned about like pipeline and production levels back
to pre-pandemic levels. Just talk to us – I think there's a fair amount of debate around whether or not the banks
will see a pick-up in loan growth. Give us a sense of – given that a wide swath of the economy in your footprint is
already open, are you seeing a pick-up in loan demand? And I guess I understand the second half-weighted loan
growth, but should we start expecting better sort of color from you in terms of loan growth picking up over the next
few months? Just give us the puts and takes on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, it's interesting when you think about the puts and takes, as you state. When you look at the liquidity that
exists in the marketplace today – we were talking about this yesterday – the average balance per checking
account in commercial is up 40% year-over-year, and on the consumer side, it's up 25% year-over-year. So, when
you think about the headwinds that exist that are leading to lower loan growth, it's really the amount of liquidity
that's sitting on the customers' balance sheets.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Now, we know that over time that will abate a bit. But the things that we're seeing that give us confidence, first
and foremost, as I mentioned, our pipelines are increasing. They were up 20% in the first quarter versus the
fourth quarter of last year. We know that our bankers are becoming more active. They're going on prospect calls.
They're having discussions with customers who are starting to plan capital expenditures for the second half of the
year.
We also know that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity with some of the new tools that we're rolling out.
Through our SMART tool, it does give us insights into opportunities where we have lending opportunities, where
in the past we may not have known that with existing customers. And then, when you think about our footprint and
you look at some of the data, unemployment in our five-state footprint is all below 5.2%, every state is below 5.2%
with the national average at 6.2%. You look at the net population inflows, all five states are in the top 15 in the
country.
So, when you take into consideration that there could be some demand coming from infrastructure, coming from
second half of the year economic activity, combine that with where we see our footprint growing, and then you
add into that the increases in talent and the productivity gains we're making, we feel like the second half of the
year is going to be constructive. But again, the biggest wildcard there will be the liquidity that sits on the balance
sheet and how long that sticks around.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Ebrahim. This is Jamie. Let me add one thing. We reiterated our guidance for 2% to 4% loan growth in 2021,
and as you're aware, we had an auto loan purchase in the first quarter. Our guidance remains the same on the
2% to 4% loan growth, excluding any sort of third-party lending portfolio purchases like what we saw in the first
quarter. So, as Kevin mentioned, we feel good about our pipeline. We believe it's weighted to the back half of the
year. And we're excluding in that guidance any sort of portfolio purchases like you saw this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's good to know. So, thanks for clarifying that, Jamie. And I guess just as a follow-up to that, on slide 11,
where you have the liquidity and you talked about that, is the message there that you would now pick up steam in
terms of bringing down those cash balances, which historically used to be, I think, $800 million to $1 billion, to
bring them down via loan purchases or investment securities deployment over the next few quarters? Just give us
a little more color around the thought process of when liquidity levels could get back to normalized levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, that is our intent. Our priority is to deploy that liquidity and excess capital to customer loan growth.
However, this is an unprecedented environment and government stimulus programs remain including Quantitative
Easing. And so, we expect core transaction deposit growth to continue, and we believe that the liquidity situation
may stay at a similarly elevated level through 2021. And so, we are prepared for that.
We will consider using strategies like what you saw in the first quarter, be it with the securities portfolio growth or
third-party assets. We're going to be very prudent in how we deploy that liquidity and that capital, but you may see
continuations of those strategies. In January, we gave guidance of the securities portfolio growing to 16% to 17%
of total assets. In the first quarter, you saw that we increased that to 16%, and I would say that it's likely that that
trends to the top-end of that range as we proceed through 2021.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Jamie, I wanted to start maybe with – to follow up maybe on the revenue guidance of down 1% to 4% in
2021, it seems you're off to a little bit of a faster start in some of your fee revenue categories for this time in the
year. And then, also last quarter, you talked about steepness of the curve, better performance with PPP.
Obviously, you guys have talked a lot about your thoughts around loan growth in the back half of the year
[indiscernible] (00:41:08) perform at the high-end of that range. It would seem, kind of given your start to the year,
you could do that. But just kind of wanted to see if you could maybe frame that up a little bit more, kind of why
you're stuck with that guidance. Is it just really kind of more the uncertainty that's out there? But it seems like
there are several things going your way at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Brad, thanks for the question. You're right that the first quarter was strong especially in our fee revenue
businesses. Mortgage continues to perform well in this environment, and I believe that's just a testament to the
mortgage team and us delivering for our customers in an environment – low-rate environment where there's so
much mortgage activity. That was strong in the first quarter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
We expect it to continue to be strong as the normalization continues through 2021. So, we expect mortgage
revenues to decline to pre-pandemic levels over the next few quarters. But we expect that those revenue declines
will be offset by broad-based growth in our other fee revenue businesses and products such as credit card, trust
and fiduciary, deposit service charges and capital markets. And so, we do expect to see those trends generally in
fee revenue.
And then, with regards to interest income, we expect the first quarter to be the low point for the full-year, and we
expect to see growth as we proceed through 2021 in NII. And to your point and your question, that's due to two
things. One is the balance sheet, and we just discussed that with Ebrahim's question. We do expect growth – the
2% to 4% growth, we are reiterating that. But we're also seeing growth in assets based on strategic decisions
we're making in treasury, and that's the third-party lending. That's the securities portfolio growth.
And we also expect to see a tailwind, to your point, on interest rate. The steepening of the curve and long rates
increasing are a positive to us. And if rates can stabilize or even increase from here, the pressure we've been
experiencing on loan origination and mortgage prepayments will abate, and they may become supportive of future
interest income. It also reduced the premium amortization that we saw in the first quarter on the securities
portfolio, which led to the lower book yield on the securities book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, this is my follow-up. Adjusted expenses were down maybe a little less than $5
million year-over-year. I think you talk about $40 million being in the run rate at this point. Is sort of the delta there
mortgage commissions or other commissions that you might see reverse out? Or do you think about maybe you
spent some of those savings in other areas? Just trying to kind of bridge the gap in expenses with the numbers
you're talking about with Synovus Forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. You are exactly right. As mortgage revenues remain elevated, you will see elevated commission expense
associated with that. But I'll also just point to the seasonal impact of normal personnel expenses in the first
quarter. They remain elevated. That was also a component of the first quarter.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Good morning, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, I wanted to start just with the third-party lending partnerships. You're at, I think, about $2 billion as of the end
of the quarter. That's about 5% of non-PPP loans. What's the appetite to continue to grow that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Brady, that's a portfolio that we look at in multi-facets. Specifically, when you look at the held for sale portfolio,
that's a different risk profile than a typical held for investment loan portfolio. And that's why we segregated it on
our slide in the earnings presentation. So, we view that risk differently. So, it's lower risk because of the
commitment to purchase component of it. But then, when you look at the held for investment portfolio, we feel
confident in our ability to manage that portfolio and to grow it from where we are today.
If you look at the assets that we are purchasing, we believe that the liquidity and marketability and credit risk that
we're taking by investing in those assets relative to the securities portfolio is – we're paid for that risk. We believe
we can manage that risk and we have experience managing that portfolio in all environments if you consider the
actions we took in 2020 as well. And so, we feel confident in that portfolio. We feel confident in leveraging it as a
way to deploy capital and liquidity.
And I'll specifically point to the auto purchase in the first quarter, because the way we look at that is we look at it
as a prime auto portfolio with about a little more than a 2-year average life. And that profile fits really well with how
we view capital and liquidity. And so, that's the type asset we're looking for, something that fits well with our
longer term view, but also an asset class that's very marketable and very liquid.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right, that's helpful. And then my follow-up, I wanted to ask you, the stock has done well – all bank stocks have
done well recently, but Synovus is now at 1.7 times tangible. So, maybe that makes the share buybacks a little
less attractive. But on the flip side, you now have a currency that you haven't had in a while. So, maybe bank
M&A is a little more realistic for you guys. But how do you think about what the stock price has done and what
impact that could have on buybacks versus bank M&A?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, Brady, this is Kevin. In the capital priorities, we've said our number one way to invest capital is back in
organic growth. And with excess capital, we would look at share repurchase, we would look at nonbank M&A, and
we would look at alternative use of capital, as Jamie mentioned, with third-party purchases. So, we evaluate all of
those on a return basis.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
But as you think about M&A, we talked about having our right to win. I would just reiterate that we think our best
investment today is an investment in Synovus. And we believe that because, as Jamie mentioned earlier, we love
our footprint. We think it provides us with outsized opportunities for growth. We also feel that we've been very
capable in attracting talent and adding new products and solutions to our – another arrow in our quiver to be able
to promote growth.
We also feel like a lot of the reasons that people are doing M&A is to just generate efficiency, and we've been
doing that internally. Jamie touched on the efficiency initiatives. But I think it's important to note that we've
reduced 180 FTE in the last two quarters or roughly 3% of our workforce, and we're doing that through Synovus
Forward. And so, we're generating efficiencies internally. And we like the size of our company. I think there is a lot
of conversations that go into scale and having to invest to be more relevant on the technology front. We feel that
we're relevant today. We have the right partners and the right fintech solutions that we feel like we can compete
with anyone.
And then, [audio gap] (00:49:08-00:49:19) you have to integrate cultures and there's a mismatch there. And then,
you have to look at what potentially could be the lost revenues that are a function of team member attrition as well
as customer attrition. So, when you take all of that into consideration, we still believe that the best investment is in
Synovus, and that's what we're doing going forward. Now, from an M&A perspective, if we were to do anything,
we've said very clearly it would be a functionality or capability or technology that would be additive to our portfolio
of solutions and would be additive to our existing customer base, and any of those would be relatively small.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe first just drilling into the expense
picture again, on the fourth quarter call, I think the guidance for 2021 was a reduction of 2% to 5%. That was
pretty much covered here in the first quarter. I guess as we look ahead, maybe help quantify what else is going to
drop to the bottom line and if that 2% to 5% reduction announced last quarter if that's still a good rate that we
should be expecting for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Jamie. Great question. We do reiterate the guidance of down 2% to 5%. And as we were discussing
earlier, higher revenues in some of our fee businesses may impact commissions, but we still feel confident in our
guidance of that decline of 2% to 5%. As we look forward in 2021, obviously, we have announced today that we –

as of 3/31, we have $40 million in run rate benefit in the Synovus Forward initiatives. And as we've mentioned
from the outset, we expect approximately two-thirds of the first $100 million to be expense initiatives.
So, we still have a ways to go in 2021 along the expense side through Synovus Forward initiatives, and that'll
come through later in the year. You'll see that in the second half of the year. And so, we believe that that's going
to be a tailwind to the second half. We would reiterate that we expect second half expenses to be lower than first
half, and we'll see those flow through in the second half of the year. We announced today that we're closing four
branches in the second quarter. That'll be a piece of it. And then, we continue to have benefits on some of our
other work streams that have been in progress like third-party spend, corporate real estate, as well as personnel
initiatives.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, just looking at the securities purchases made during the quarter, it
looks like the duration in the securities book increased a couple of years. Maybe just talk about utilizing some of
the excess liquidity, whether it's through securities or third-party purchases, your willingness to take on duration
and how you balance that with balance sheet positioning for potentially a steeper yield curve and/or higher rates
down the road.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a good question. You're right. The duration did extend in the first quarter, and that was largely due to
the increase in interest rates, just the convexity profile of that portfolio. If you were to see interest rates continue to
increase on the long end, we would expect to see further extension, even though I would say that at some point
you get to a terminal duration on some of these mortgage assets. We have remained diligent with the assets
we're putting on the books. We have been buying mortgages at a premium and it's fairly well split between 30-
year mortgages, 15-year and 20-year mortgages and some with structure to protect against extension.
And so, we haven't changed our investment profile. The duration extension really is due to interest rates alone.
But you're right, we did have a significant amount of investments in the first quarter, approximately $1 billion. The
going on yield of those investments was around 1.40% to 1.60% depending on the asset. And we will look to grow
that portfolio this year, approach the top-end of our guidance, that 16% to 17% of total assets as we go through
the year.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Kessel, congrats again on a great job as the CEO as
everyone else has stated. My question is around credit. I did notice that criticized and classified were up a little bit.
Obviously, the credit picture continues to improve. I guess what drove that? And then, just from a provision
standpoint, I think you've talked about getting the loan loss reserve back to kind of day one – post-CECL day one
levels at some point down the road. Has the outlook improved where we could see very low levels of provision as
we move forward for at least the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Michael. This is Kevin. I'll take that, and this may be a bit of a lengthy answer just because I want to be
comprehensive. But I think it's important when you look at the credit metrics this quarter to look at the entire body
of work. As Jamie mentioned, we're relatively stable with NPAs, NPLs, charge-offs, and our provision is showing
an improving environment. But as you ask, looking specifically at criticized and classified, I think it's important to
note that our grading process is largely a function of historical financial statements. So, the movement you saw
this quarter was more of a result of the headwinds that we saw back in 2020 and those revenue headwinds being
incorporated into the respective financial statements for this year as we've been doing our grading process.
Most of the increase was related to our COVID-impacted industries, hospitality and restaurants [indiscernible]
(00:55:45) related to some consumer mortgages that remained on deferment under the standard GSE standard
guidance. And I'll remind you that with most of those COVID-related industries, despite the revenue challenges,
as we said back in 2020, we felt strong LTVs and sponsorships would mitigate much of the risk that we saw there.
So, I would tell you that the criticized and classified ratios are really a rearview mirror perspective on credit. And I
think it's important to note even with the increases, our absolute levels for criticized and classified are below that
of our peers. Now, I think to truly reflect and assess what the credit environment and the expectations are going
forward, I think you have to look at more of the real-time data and forward-looking measurement.
So, in our appendix, we did provide the updated cash inflow data from January and February. And I think when
you look at that, Michael, you'll see that in aggregate, our businesses have returned to pre-pandemic levels in
terms of cash inflow. We also know through our second round of P3 that we had another $1.1 billion in application
volume. So, we know many of those COVID-impacted industries are being supported through economic stimulus.
And then, when you look at some of the underlying data in things like hospitality, you'll see that ADRs in the hotel
industry are returning to normalized levels. We've seen occupancy pick up significantly in Florida with all of the
markets there with the exception of Orlando in recent months having over 70% occupancy. And we expect that to
continue into the summer [indiscernible] (00:57:20) and people starting to go out and travel into the footprint in
these drivable destinations. And then, on the same front, you look at restaurants, QSRs are performing at or
above where they were pre-pandemic, and you're starting to see full and limited-service restaurants back to 90%
of the levels that they had so very strong improvement there.
And then lastly, I would tell you to look at as you go forward and have an outlook, the – as Jamie mentioned on
the call, the CECL life-of-loan estimates continue to decline with this reversal in provision this quarter. And based
upon our economic forecast, we would expect this to continue, and we would also expect to see a significant level
of upgrades in the coming quarters while our charge-offs are going to remain fairly low in the near-term. So,
hopefully, that addresses the credit question. Jamie, I'll let you cover the provision.

Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin mentioned, the allowance [ph] for loan ratio (00:58:18) declined quarter-on-quarter. We
believe that's indicative of the environment. We would say that there's a significant amount of uncertainty in the
outlook. We still have a large weighting to adverse scenarios in our CECL modeling. But we also – I would point
to the fact that we've made adjustments to model inputs in our quantitative portion of our allowance calculation.
At a high level, these adjustments are due to our expectation that stimulus will serve to delay charge-offs rather
than cure them. If our outlooks change – if our outlook changes to the expectation that stimulus is a cure, then our
life-of-loss estimates would decrease fairly significantly. So, I would point to that as one impact, and we will see
how this plays out as we get further along. But that is a key assumption in our allowance calculation.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
It's a very comprehensive answer. So, I appreciate it. Just one quick follow-up. So, last quarter, you talked about
mortgage revenues being down 40% to 50%. It seems like it's going to be better than that. Just based on your
pipeline, the hirings that you've made and kind of the strength in your markets, any sort of gauge for what you'd
expect that to be down now this year? Thanks.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, this is Jamie. I would adjust that range to down 10% to 30%. I would acknowledge that that's a
broad range. And hopefully, we end up at the high-end of that range. But I would definitely expect to see it higher
than what we were expecting in January.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Kessel, I just wanted to say best of luck. I hope you make the most of retirement and certainly well-deserved.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
So, just – I just want to start on the NII outlook. I know you had indicated that you see the first quarter as a trough
and you expect upside from here. What – can you just maybe talk about what margin assumption is behind that,
just how you think about the progression of the margin from here, given the shape of the curve, excluding the
impact of PPP? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, when you back out the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program, we actually would expect to see
margin improvement as we head through the year. Depending on how you would calculate the impact of PPP, it's
– we would say that the Paycheck Protection Program impact in the first quarter was somewhere along the lines
of 12 to 15 basis points, which is less than the straight fee income impact, but also including the 1% rate on those
loans which is non-dilutive.
And so, we expect – just like we expect NII, we would expect the margin to increase as we go through the year
due to the benefit of interest rates, long-term interest rates, and higher interest rates than where we are now and
the improved going on yields. And so, we think that's a tailwind. But I would give it a big caveat that there were not
– it's uncertain how much liquidity will be on the balance sheet. And so, the cash impact is significant. You're well
aware that the impact is approximately 6 basis points per $1 billion. And so, that is uncertain and that could be
very dilutive to the margin, but not impactful to NII as we go through the rest of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jamie. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the loan growth, it was more about timing is kind
of what I'm interested in, in terms of how are you thinking about it internally in terms of the timing of the return of
your line utilization off that 40% level to that normalized 46%? And I guess the same goes for the production
levels reaching the pre-pandemic point. How do you think about the timing given how things are trajecting? Are
we looking at – if not through the back half of this year, is it in the first half of next year? I just want to get an idea
of how you expect that progression. Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, it's a great question, and there's a lot of assumptions and uncertainties that go into that. To your
point, we're pointing towards the second half of the year, and that's just based upon our trended data that shows,
as I said earlier, pipelines are up 20% in the first quarter and production is only now about 11% down versus the
first quarter of 2020. So, we're continuing to see improvement. And as pipelines improve, as bankers become
more active, we're optimistic that we'll start to see loan growth pick up.
Now, as Jamie mentioned, this quarter, a big reason for our core growth being down was because of the
consumer book. So, we saw more churn on the consumer mortgage portfolio, and that led to about $100 million
reduction in HELOC. But I think it's important to note that we did see a growth in both C&I although it was modest
and CRE. So, we expect that trend to continue, and as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect that mid
single-digit growth in CRE and C&I and consumer was going to be a challenge. Now, Jamie also mentioned
earlier how we are able to offset some of the run-off in mortgage and home equity with the purchase book. But we
remain optimistic on the commercial side.

Hey, a quick question sort of drilling down maybe on the margin and more on the – maybe taking a look at the
deposit side here. Obviously, you guys are bumping along near historic lows there. Just curious where – if you
think you could take them even lower here and maybe where you see the bottom for deposit cost here over the
near-term.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah. Dave, this is Jamie. Thanks for the question. We do believe we have opportunities to further reduce deposit
cost as we go through 2021 for multiple reasons. First is time deposits. We have $1.1 billion maturing here in the
second quarter at approximately just a little bit more than a 1% rate. And we believe that we'll likely continue to
run those off as we go through the year, the higher cost time deposits. And we believe we also have opportunities
to further reduce non-maturity deposits. We've had success working with our customers on non-maturity deposits
over the past few quarters and we expect that to continue. So, if the rate and liquidity environment remains similar
to the current expectations, we're targeting a total deposit cost in the mid-teens. This will rely on future efforts to
further reduce all of these deposit costs, but we feel confident in the team's ability to achieve those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Got it. That's good color. Then, maybe sort of conversely on the loan yield side, it looks like those are stabilizing.
Just curious what you're seeing across the various markets and in products there, just with the economy opening
up across your footprint and across the country there. Are you seeing sort of risk premiums being washed away
somewhat? Are you able to better price for risk here? Just curious what you're seeing just in terms of loan yields
present and just loan yields in general across the market. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, Dave, it's a great question. I think if you look at our entire book ex fees, our portfolio is about 3.67%
and production is coming in a little below that in the 3.40%, 3.50% range on the yield side. And I think it goes back
to Jamie's point, with the excess liquidity that exists not only in banking, but across the entire spectrum, that we
haven't seen people changing strictures or changing their risk profile, but we have seen people competing on
price. And obviously, that's easier to do when you're carrying the cash balances that most commercial banks are
carrying. So, it's becoming – look, in my career, it's never been a call where I've said that it's not competitive on
price. But now it's as competitive as ever, but it's on the high credit quality type loans. It's not on chasing risk and
trying to price for it. It's everyone's trying to stay down the middle of the fairway, but price appropriately to win
business, which means that we have some pressure on the margin there.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
So, just first I just noticed that AOCI had a good drop this quarter. Can you just speak to what were the drivers
bringing down the AOCI account?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steve, that really has to do with the unrealized gain on the securities portfolio and interest rates increasing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, that was just simply – okay. Yeah. And Kevin, you'd mentioned that the Synovus Forward will – you're
going to start shifting more towards the revenue side with some of that coming from net interest income. So, is
that essentially meaning that it's coming from increased loan growth looking forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's really all of the above. Steve, when we look at our revenue initiatives, we talk about the $10 million that we
had accomplished in the quarter. About $6 million of that came from our treasury repricing and another $3 million
from deposit repricing, and we had $1 million in some of our ancillary fee income. As we look to the future
revenue initiatives, there will be an expansion through our analytics program, where if you just break it down,
analytics is providing insights to our frontline bankers who then are able to go out and proactively sell new
solutions. Some of those solutions are going to be lending, some of them are going to be money market and
savings accounts, which obviously have an impact on the margin. Others are going to be related to treasury and
payment solutions, and so that'll show up more on the fee income line.
So, we haven't given a specific mix and where those are coming in, because part of it is as we execute on those
leads, we'll have a better recognition of where the revenue is coming from. But what we have seen from the pilot
phases of the SMART tool, the majority of the leads in this first round are coming on the fee income side. So,
we're seeing it more on the treasury side. Now, as we go forward in some of the revenue initiatives that we have
in play into 2022, it'll be bringing on new specialty lending teams, it'll be adding new products and solutions to the
lending platform. So, there will be additional NII that comes from that. So, as we execute on those revenue
initiatives, we'll provide a better delineation of the geography of where it's hitting the P&L.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the comments Kevin made earlier in the call about the ability to
price for advice. And I was curious if any of the revenue gains thus far, I know it's early on Synovus Forward, has
reflected that or is there some price increases that you're getting or would we think about this as just net new
business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Chris, it's a great question. I think it's both. So, when we see today, the – we just mentioned the $6 million
quarterly run rate impact that we've gotten from what we call Pricing for Value comes out of our treasury and
payment solutions area. So, we have increased pricing there, but those are increasing to market levels.
And I think not only is it important to reference their market levels, I think it's important to be able to maintain that
pricing you have to provide value. And so, for us, it's about increasing the amount of advice and consultation
we're providing to our commercial customers as it relates to cash management services and what we can do for
them to save them time and money.
As it relates to new products, I think a lot of the advice from a revenue standpoint will be about how do we
execute. It's bringing over assets under management by being a financial advisor. It's doing financial plans in our
branches to be able to unearth some of the opportunities that our branches are getting with our consumer
customers.
And on the commercial side, we're running things like – it's called client planning, where we're sitting down and
understanding all of the opportunities that we have with the client based on what they're using today. So, then it
results in having to go out and sell those products. So, advice to me is something that you can get paid for. You
just have to deliver it in a timely manner, and it has to be something where the customer finds a benefit in the
solution.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. That's helpful, Kevin. And real quick, you are getting new business out of the Florida FCB franchise. I know
it's evolving, but I just want to confirm that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're getting growth out of Florida. Look, that's one of the reasons that we liked the Florida acquisition was
that that marketplace is growing. Now, in general, I was going to mention earlier that when you look at just
account growth this quarter, we had 8,000 consumer net new accounts this quarter. We had 2,000 net new
commercial checking accounts this quarter, and that came from all over our five-state footprint. But both of those
numbers are high watermarks for new accounts, and that's net new. So, we're seeing account growth across the
franchise, and I think South Florida and Central Florida have been big contributors to the growth.

Operator: The next question is from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. A follow-up on the revenue outlook. Kevin, you identified on
slide 12 the three areas that should help the company deliver sustainable top-quartile performance. But you
maintained the guidance of adjusted revenue to decline 1% to 4% this year. I know you said you're starting to see
strength in some fee income products. But when could we expect to start seeing a more material pickup in total
revenue growth? Is this more of a second half of 2021 event or more of 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Anthony, it's a great question because I think, to your point, when you're evaluating growth on top line revenue,
one thing that's important to note, as we enter 2021 and as we move throughout the year, is that we've been
hindered a bit by our asset sensitivity. So, the reduction in rates is putting some headwinds on top line. I don't
think that takes away from the fact that we still feel very confident at some of the underlying levers of growth. As I
mentioned earlier, we're starting to see opportunities where the loan growth is starting to play out in the second
half of the year. We had CRE growth in the first quarter and we're expecting C&I to pick up with or without
utilization.
We talked about our ability to generate growth in fee income. We're up 18% in fiduciary and asset management,
up 10% year-over-year in card fees, up 5% in brokerage. So, the fee income businesses are continuing to
contribute. We've also talked previously about investing in specialization and specialty lending within our
wholesale bank. If you look at where we've grown there year-over-year, we're up $500 million in loan growth in
our specialty finance area. Public finance is up 31%, senior housing 25% and specialty healthcare up 26%. I give
you all those because we believe that there are core pockets of growth that are going to start to be seen once the
overhang of the reduction in interest rates kind of falls out. So, latter half of 2021, into 2022, we think the story is
going to be more compelling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, my follow-up, how much of the $2 billion of core transaction deposit growth you saw this quarter
would you say is sticky versus temporary due to things like stimulus payments?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, I think you can look at the amount of funding that we said we had on P3, and that was about $900 million.
So, let's just say you subtract that out, it would still suggest that more than half of the balances came on as sticky
deposits. Now, when we say sticky deposits, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is it sticky for the next 10 years or is it
sticky for the next 2 years. But we do believe there was high quality growth outside of the P3 balances that we
were able to fund this quarter.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the time this morning. I'll try to be brief here. Jamie, I was hoping
maybe you could just help us ring-fence a dollar amount around – in the salaries and personnel expense, how
much was seasonal and sort of where you would expect that to go in the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brody, in the first quarter, we had approximately $6 million to $7 million that was seasonal, just annual
increases in personnel expense. And so, that's what will go away as we go through this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And the four branches that you outlined, I think the previous benefit from the last closures was about
$925,000 per branch. Is that a similar kind of benefit this go around?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I assume $500,000 per branch.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great. And then, just one on the loan portfolio, I noticed that the senior housing ticked up quite a bit
this quarter. Just wanted to ask, how much of that was PPP-related and how much was non-PPP-related? And
then, just more broadly on the entire loan portfolio, Jamie or Kevin, maybe you could just give us a sense for what
percent of the portfolio is floating rate at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take the first on senior housing, Brody. None of the growth in senior housing was related to P3. It was all
organic growth. We actually brought in seven new relationships to the bank this quarter in senior housing. They
continue to do very well. We have none of those loans that are in deferment. We have none that are past due. So,
that portfolio has held up extremely well, and now there's opportunities for expansion. As you know, that team has
been doing this for quite some time. They follow operators around the country. And so, there's going to be

continued new opportunities there. We have taken the opportunity to grow that book, but none of it is related to
P3.
When you look at the growth this quarter in general, healthcare continues to be a good area of growth for us in
general, not just senior housing. We've also seen growth in the construction industry, as Bob has mentioned in
the past. We also saw growth this quarter in professional services, financial and insurance as well, and a little bit
of growth in manufacturing. So, we're starting to see it broad-based across several industries, which is good. But
senior housing is just one of those areas. Jamie, I'll let you answer the variable rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're 52% variable rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I guess what percent of that would you consider floating?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
All of that is floating rate. And of that, about 8% of loans are prime-based and you have around 44% that are
based off of LIBOR.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Two questions really quick. Kevin, you mentioned you'll likely be hiring some specialty teams over the next one or
two years. Can you give us some more color on that? And my second question is if you look at the submarkets
across the Synovus footprint, which one seemed particularly ripe for more market share gains for you right now?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Jennifer. Look, as you think about specialty, it really come out of two forms. One would be
industry-type specialties focusing on specific industries, and I'd throw things out there like QSRs, transportation,
logistics, things that fit within our footprint where today we're covering them and not always covering them with
specialists but with generalists. We're looking to build out our capability there.
We've proven that when you bring in specialty teams, it provides a value to our customers and it generates
growth. So, we're looking at industry. And then, the second would be on product. As you think about the products
that we offer today, we don't have a full set of asset classes. So, we may look to expand into leasing or equipment
finance or accelerate some of our specialty lending areas into new forms of asset-based lending. So, those are
the two areas we would look.
And then, in terms of growth, look, I would start with the markets that we're already strong in. You look at markets
like Atlanta, where we have a strong market share. When you have that sort of density, it provides you with an
opportunity to continue to grow. We think the underlying market is growing, and as you know, there's some
disruption in that market.
But I would also look at the Florida market, I mentioned earlier South Florida, Central Florida, tremendous
opportunity when you see the number of businesses and the amount of population growth that's happened in
Florida. We need to make sure that we continue to exercise our right to win in that footprint. And then, I wouldn't
leave out some of these secondary markets that we often talk about, Greenville, Charleston, Augusta, Georgia,
places where we feel like we have an opportunity to win and we're picking up market share. And it's probably not
on the radar of some of the large bulge bracket firms.

Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
First real quick, can I ask about the reserve ratio that I recognize the change in expectations and that led to the
negative provision? Assuming there is no material change in where expectations go from here, would we expect a
positive provision as you have better loan growth, but for that ratio to come down more gradually than what we
saw this quarter? I know that's tough without you put the different inputs in the model, but assuming what you see
looking out from here. Thanks.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Kevin, it's Jamie. What I would say – the way I would answer that is, similar to what we said in [indiscernible]
(01:22:58) there's uncertainty. We believe that our allowance is adequate given our outlook and the uncertainty in
the outlook. But we do see scenarios where credit costs remain low and charge-offs remain low like what we're –
our guidance right now is for charge-offs to remain low in the near-term. We feel like we have line of sight into
that, and then we'll see where it goes from there. And as I mentioned earlier, at some point, you will come to a
resolution around the question of did stimulus delay charge-offs or did it cure charge-offs? And for us, that's the
important question with regards to our allowance. And I believe that that's more of a function of time, because we
need to get past the incremental stimulus efforts to really know the state of all of our creditors – all of our
borrowers.
And so, that's what we're looking for. But we feel good about where we are right now. As you see, our allowance
to loan ratio declined 12 basis points on the quarter adjusted for P3. If you look at our guidance on charge-offs, it's
for stable at a very low level. We feel good with what we see in the loan book today, and that's something that
we'll constantly reassess as we go through 2021. We do remain of the belief that in a more normalized
environment, assuming no material changes to loan mix, that we will approach a day one allowance level, and for
us, that was 1.06%. But we're uncertain of the timing of that.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
That's great. Thank you. And last but certainly not least, I just want to say congrats to Kessel. It's been a privilege
and honor for me for several years to cover Synovus and to get to know you and to be a witness to your tenure as
CEO. I think in several notes ago, Kessel, I titled it improvise, adapt and overcome related to Synovus, and I
really feel that that's kind of a good generalization of how I viewed the journey here. And so, maybe I might just
throw this back to you, Kessel, beyond quarterly earnings, if you could take a minute and talk about what aspects
you're most proud of or you've improved in the operating model as you're handing over to Kevin here at this point.
Thanks.

Kessel D. Stelling Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Wow, Kevin, that's a loaded question. Thanks for those comments. You might make it tough for me to close. I
don't know that I have a proud moment. I'm proud of this team and I'm proud of the tenacity of the team. If I look
back to 30 charterers consolidated when people thought that that could never change, I think of the – gosh, the
recapture of the DTA, the repayment of TARP in a way that was much more efficient I think than the market
expected. Gosh, the creativity of the Cabela's transaction, which was kind of lost, where we received a $75 million
fee for facilitating a transaction that quite frankly has called on our regulatory standing and our knowledge of that
industry. And then, two, I think, great acquisitions, Global One, FCB.
But the glue that held that all together was the – again, the tenacity of the team, the united nature of our board
which never wavered throughout my tenure when there were some tough days, Kevin, as you remember. And
then, again, our customers never left us. We had sticky customers through the crisis. We have sticky customers
today. And again, I'm proud of the relationships we formed with those of you on this call. I've received so many
notes, not just nice things said today, but notes as we've been on this call from many of you. I've traveled with
many of you. I've probably argued with many of you. But I have deep respect for what you all do for our industry,
and you really do help make our company better.
I will just add one last thing. Many of you have congratulated me on retirement. I don't consider this a retirement.
It's a new phase as I move into Executive Chair. I am all-in in helping this team and this company succeed. As a
matter of fact, at 6:30 this morning, we gathered in Jamie's office, and I in a very serious way asked Jamie and
Kevin to think about – and I was pretty serious, they weren't – to think about what role they wanted me to play in
preparing them for the next quarter earnings call. And I got kind of a blank look. So, I think more to come on that.
But I'm all-in for this company. So, I guess, Kevin, I always said I wanted to leave this company better than when I
found it. There were some great leaders before me. I hope I've done that. Again, I'm proud of the relationships.
I'm proud of, I hope, the reputation we have for transparency with you guys, transparency with our regulators, and
again the support that I've enjoyed from board to executive team to the [indiscernible] (01:28:07) in the most
remote branch. It's just been an honor to serve this company. And I appreciate your comments and thank you for
that question.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
Kessel Stelling for any closing remarks. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, thank you. I think I just gave one. But let me just thank everyone again for joining and for your continued
interest in and support of our company. I think as you've heard throughout the update today, challenges persist,
but our team remains determined. Our first quarter results certainly reflect our ability to deliver despite the
environment. Our focus is right. Our priorities are right. Our investments are in the right places in customer
experience, in digital advisory capabilities.
And this team fully understands that we must continue to execute and deliver on the expectations we've set. So,
again, as I just said, as I move into my new role of Executive Chairman and Kevin Blair steps in as CEO, I just
want to make sure everyone understands that the energy and the optimism among our team are high and I've just
never been more confident in the future of this great company. So, thank you all again on this call and hope you
have a great rest of the day. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now
disconnect.
