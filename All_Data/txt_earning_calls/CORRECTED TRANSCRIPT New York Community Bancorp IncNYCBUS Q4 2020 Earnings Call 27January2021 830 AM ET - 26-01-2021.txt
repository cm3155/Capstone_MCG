......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. And thank you for joining us today.
Before turning to the financial details, I would like to take the opportunity to introduce our new CFO, John Pinto to
everyone on the call. As you know, John Pinto was named CFO at the end of last year, succeeding me in that
position, as I transitioned to the role of President and CEO.
John and I have worked together for 22 years, going back to the time with Richmond County Bancorp and we
have worked very closely since we have both joined New York Community in 2001. Going forward, John will be
spending more time with the analysts and investment community. Please join me in wishing him well as I know
that he will do a terrific job as the company's new CFO.
Now, turning over to the results. Early this morning, we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.39 on a
GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2020, up 70% compared to the year ago quarter and up
95% compared to the previous quarter. For the full year, we reported a $1.02 per share on a GAAP basis, up 32%
compared to last year. These numbers include an income tax benefit of $55.3 million for the quarter and $68.4
million for the year related to certain tax provisions of the CARES Act.
On a non-GAAP basis, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.27 per share, $0.01 better than consensus estimates,
and our full year earnings were $0.87 per share, up 13% compared to 2019.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
We are pleased with the company's financial performance over the course of 2020. As everyone knows, last year
was a challenging year due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the local and
national economy, our customers and our employees. Despite these challenges, we turned in strong operating
results highlighted by double-digit EPS growth, continued net interest margin expansion, a strong 23% increase of
pre-provision net revenue and strong growth in origination volumes.
Additionally, our asset quality metrics continued to improve as non-performing assets fell. And to-date, our loan
deferral program has proven to be very successful, as virtually all our loans eligible to come off deferral have
returned to payment status. As we've previously disclosed, our deferral program is somewhat unique in that it is
for an initial six-month period as opposed to a three-month period. Accordingly, the vast majority of our loans on
deferral are eligible to come off their initial deferral period during the fourth quarter, primarily during the month of
October and November.
As of December 31, total multi-family and CRE loans deferred dropped 99% to $80 million or 0.2% of total
outstanding loan balances, compared to $5.9 billion or 15.5% at June 30, 2020. Multi-family deferrals were $74
million compared to $2.3 billion at June 30, while CRE deferrals declined to $6 million, compared to $2.3 billion at
June 30. Office deferrals at the end of the year was zero, while retail and mixed use deferrals were each about $1
million.
Most of the remaining deferrals are eligible to come off deferral during the first two months of the year. Despite all
the economic challenges during the fourth quarter, our [ph] segment (00:05:23) of the New York City real estate
markets, the non-luxury rent-regulated portion of the multi-family market continues to hold up extraordinarily well.
Our borrowers continue to pay us and rent collections have remained above pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the
vaccine rollout, an additional fiscal stimulus by the new administration should help the local economy and that
should support multi-family and CRE properties in our region.
We patiently look forward to the eventual reopening of the five boroughs, putting New York City on par with the
rest of the state. These trends are not only evident in our deferral numbers, but are also evident in our overall
asset quality metrics. Non-performing assets declined $9 million or 16% to $46 million compared to the third
quarter, representing 8 basis point to total assets. The majority of our NPAs are a taxi medallion related.
Excluding taxi medallion related loans, NPAs would have been $21 million at the end of the year or 4 basis points
of total assets.
Another highlight was the net interest margin. Excluding the impact on prepayment income, the net interest
margin improved 40 basis points to 2.30% during the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
The margin improvement continues to reflect lower funding costs as the overall cost of funds dropped 88 basis
points to 1.06% during the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
The decline of funding costs was primarily driven by re-pricing of our CD portfolio. The average cost of CDs
declined 129 basis points to 1.04%, driving our overall cost of deposits down 115 basis points to 0.61%. This was
partially offset by 37 basis points year-over-year decline and average yields to 3.47%. Some of this decline is
attributable to lower yields on loans and securities given the low mortgage rate environment.
We also added liquidity during the fourth quarter as you will see by the year-over-year increase in our cash
balances and the quarter-over-quarter increase in securities. With interest rates at historically low levels over the
past year and a flat yield curve environment, we intentionally kept these balances low. But now we are
rebalancing our cash and securities position to more appropriate levels as we prepare for potentially steeper yield
curve environment.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
Moving onto the other major highlights of the quarter; pre-provision net revenue, PPNR for the fourth quarter
increased 42% to $189 million on a year-over-year basis and it was up 13% compared to the third quarter. For the
full year, PPNR increased 23% to $650 million. This was driven by a combination of revenue growth as net
interest income rose based on higher margin, loan growth and lower funding costs, along with flat operating
expenses.
Turning now over to the lending side. Total multi-family loans increased $1.1 billion or 3% to $32.3 billion,
compared to last year. During the current fourth quarter, multi-family loan growth was impacted by market
conditions which favored GSE financing as opposed to portfolio lending. This resulted in a higher than normal
level of loans which we financed away from us. However, this was offset by higher prepayment income during the
quarter, which at $20.9 million was the highest quarterly level of the year.
Our specialty finance portfolio continued to grow over the course of 2020, as specialty finance loans and leases
increased $439 million or 17%. Our year-end 2020 outstanding specialty finance loans and leases totaled $3.1
billion, while total commitments were $4.8 billion. Origination volumes continue to be strong. Total originations in
2020 were $12.9 billion, up 21% compared to the 2019 origination volumes. As for our loan pipeline, our current
pipeline going into the first quarter of 2021 is $1.5 billion, including $1.1 billion of multi-family loans, of which 61%
is new money.
On the funding side, total deposit at year end was $32.4 billion, up $780 million or 2% compared to the previous
year. Throughout 2020, as market rates declined, we lowered our CD rates, and not surprisingly, CD balances
declined. However, this decline was largely offset by growth in each of our other deposit categories, which carry
lower rates, including saving accounts increasing $1.6 billion to $6.4 billion. Non-interest bearing accounts up
$648 million to $3.1 billion, interest bearing checking and money market accounts growing $2.4 billion to $12.6
billion.
Before going into Q&A, I'd I like to make a few comments since I was named as the new President and CEO of
New York Community. Many of you have opined on what this move means for the strategic direction of this
company. Let me frame it for you this way. We have a business model with an unprecedented track record of
strong asset quality, which goes back over 50 years and spans multiple business cycles. We will not deviate from
that business model that has proven successful over five decades.
Going forward, we will take that same level of energy and commitment and apply to the funding sides. Historically,
we have funded ourselves as a traditional thrift. However, with our recent partnership with Fiserv and new
competitive cash management solution, we will be better able to change our funding mix by improving our
processes geared towards attracting more core deposit relationships.
Focusing on the liability side of the balance sheet does not mean that there will be less of a focus on our loan
book. On the lending side, we see continued growth within the multi-family business, which demonstrated its
resilience during the pandemic, both from – within our current borrower base and from new customers. We will
also look at both new and complementary lines of businesses as opportunities present themselves similar to what
we did with our specialty finance business.
Another opportunity for us lies within our branch network. This is a blank canvas for us and it will be another area
of extreme focus under my responsibility. All of this will be done through a combination of organic growth and/or
lift-outs from other financial institutions or through likeminded M&A partners. We will consider all opportunities that
make sense to shareholders. All options are on the table.

Lastly, I'd like to end my formal comments by thanking all of our employees who worked so diligently throughout
2020, whether it was remotely or in person. Our results would not have been achieved without their commitment
to the company and to our customers. I cannot be more proud of how our entire organization performed last year,
given all the challenges from the pandemic.
On that note, I would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions. We will do our very best to get to
all of you within the time remaining. If we don't, please feel free to call us later today or the week. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session question. [Operator
Instructions] The first questions come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America Securities. Please
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, Tom.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert A
Cangemi
Director, President &
Chief Executive Officer,
New York Community
Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good. So, first of all, congrats on the CEO appointment. And just talk to us about expense outlook. I know
expense has ticked up higher in the fourth quarter, but I heard you talk about some potential for branch savings.
And I understand that you may not be ready to have all the details on that. But just give us a sense of where
expenses should trend as we look forward into the next quarter, or over the next year, if you can talk to 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Yes. Sure, Ebrahim. So, I would say that, yes, we had some movement on the expense in the fourth
quarter. Again, driven from my previous commentary, the movement from classified assets for us, obviously,
there's a cost of that. We're very comfortable with managing through this difficult time on the classification side.
However, that does come at a cost. So FDIC expenses on an accrual basis has elevated significantly over the
past call it six months. That had a significant contribution to the fourth quarter as well as some taxi medallion
related expenses.
About $1.8 million on taxi medallion, the differential, I'd say, off of my guide was driven off FDIC costs. Those
costs will continue. So I'd say for the – we'll just give the Q1 guide, $134 million is my estimate. So it's pretty much
flat for the fourth quarter. And typically, Q1, this quarter, high for the bank. So, I'd say, Q1 is around $134 million.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
You can kind of think about annualization somewhere between $530 million, John? $535 million-ish – $530 million
to $535 million. And I think that's a reasonable run rate.
Again, I'm not yet prepared to give that as a full guide for 2021. But on a quarterly perspective, I think we're going
to be pretty much close to Q4. And obviously, that typically is our quarter high in Q1 versus previous years when
we compare.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And how soon should we expect you to have an update just around branch rationalization and what you want to
do? Like, what's a reasonable timeframe, when we should expect an update?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, look, we look at the branches all the time as part of our business model. We're very focused on the real estate
side. We had a handful of branches that we evaluated last year. I think it was a total of 14 branches that we put it
on the table for potential reshuffling and that continues, and we're going to go through all our operations.
Obviously, the world is changing regarding banking and we're going to look at our branch structure. And if we see
deficiencies in that, we'll move opportunistically.
So, I would say, stay tuned. Don't expect to see a major restructuring on the branches unless we have a major
deal to announce, but we will – from time-to-time we do go through our leases that come due. We look at the run
rate as far as the economics of exiting one and we will be opportunistic depending on the market conditions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess just moving to the margin, so I think you still have – you flagged a fair amount of high cost CDs
coming up and debt coming up for maturity. Just tell us in terms of the refi costs for these and just your
expectation on the core margin going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, look, as everyone knows, we had a lot of opportunities in 2020, given where we were and where we
are today. I still believe that we're going to see historical lows in our cost of fund, in particular, on the retail side.
So, I would say with certainty, in Q1, we will be at our historical low. I believe that was around 50 basis points as a
historical low. We'll probably break that in Q1 and that's going to be an ongoing phenomenon throughout the year,
assuming rates stay close to zero.
So, I think it's fair to say that given the level of excess liquidity put on, given the balance sheet and what we
expect to redeploy some of that excess cash will probably costs us about 2 basis points in Q4 and probably 2
basis points in Q1. I can safely guide between 3 to 5 basis points improvement in the first quarter, obviously, it's
albeit at a slower pace than the previous year, but given the magnitude of the drop of the CD book.
And the CD portfolio as well as overall cost of deposit should decline, I guess, is by the third quarter somewhere
below 40 basis points. It could be 35 to 38 basis points, depending how many of these customers go into a much
lower liability instrument. So, I think we're going to see margin expansion throughout 2021, throughout the year,

we'll guide up for the quarter 3 basis points to 5 basis points in Q1. And I think what's on the table now is what
happens with the shape of the yield curve.
We had some nice gyrations in the fourth quarter. If that continues in the back and starts to improve here, our
customers will probably come to the table and look to accelerate refinancing. And we'll be there to serve a nice
spread in this environment in a healthy multi-family market. The multi-family market has been extremely healthy
despite the pandemic. So, if you look at all the asset classes, people are paying their rents. We're predominantly
a niche player in a rent-regulated space and there's refinancing happening on a daily basis. So, we hope that we
see a better yield curve that could also drive the margin higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And if I may just squeeze in one more on the multi-family market, you mentioned GSE competitive -- got
more competitive towards the end of the year. Just give us the outlook, do you see this portfolio – multi-family
portfolio growing and what's kind of the feedback you're getting from your borrower base in terms of what they're
looking to do?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, 2020 was a very interesting year. The GSEs was very competitive before the pandemic. They put us to
compete with a very significant level in January, February, March, pandemic hit, they disappeared. Now, literally,
they could be -- we were in business in Q2 and spreads gapped out. We were doing some really solid business,
we had good growth. But Q1 of 2020 was competitive. And I'd say for Q2 and Q3, they were kind of trying to fill
their role of their quota versus tightening up their underwriting standards, taking it through the pandemic and
social distancing and figuring out remote origination. And then by Q3, Q4, they kind of figured that out in a very
strong way and had to fill their coffers. And fourth quarter was very noticeable as many customers evaluated the
rate environment. Lot of those commitments are probably done in Q3, they close in Q4.
We did a really strong job on protecting the loan book, so we've actually executed with some of our larger
customers to protect these great relationships than we competed against the GSEs. However, there was some
loans that went away, given the market conditions, the yields were low and the dollars were heavy. And again, we
protect the credit of the portfolio. It's all about the long-term credit metrics of this bank. And clearly, looking at
some of the deals that were on the table, we let them go and you can see the elevation of prepayment activity.
As we stand today in January, it appears that there's less storybook loans going away to the GSEs as of today.
They filled their coffers last year and we'll see what happens as we go forward here. But if there's a sloping yield
curve and the back end starts to spike up higher, typically what happens is customers go back to the portfolio
lenders, five and seven year money becomes more [ph] of the product de jure (00:19:38) and we tend to be very
competitive there.
So, right now, it seems like we – we're setting ourselves up for growth as we go into 2021, 3% to 5% high net
multi-family loan growth is reasonable. I like it to be around 5%, I think it's achievable. However, the shape of the
yield curve will really depend on the level of activity. If there's a spike in the yield curve, we think a lot of these
customers that are coming due will accelerate refinance and we'll be ready to lend.

Thank you, Mark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First question I had Tom, just to clarify on that 3 basis point to 5 basis point guide on the NIM that you gave. I
assume that excludes prepayment penalty income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's correct, Mark. We don't guide prepayment penalty income. That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Okay. And then, secondly, it sounded like from your comments that we'll see some changes on the liability
side of the balance sheet. But there were also some new lending niches that you'd consider and, I guess, I'm
curious what those might be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
But Mark, there's a level of excitement here. Culturally, we've always been all about the credit and service
extremely well, but there is an opportunity here. I've been saying this for, what, many years. The low lying fruit of
the full relationship lending is out there. I'd say complimentary lines of business, for example, if you have a very

wealthy family who is looking for a line of credit, and we tend not to service lines of credit, that's an easy exercise
for us. We know the customer. We know the opportunity. We're very comfortable with the history. No reason we
should not have a line of credit with a strong borrower. That relates into more relationship lending, more deposit
flows.
Now, we're getting better deposit [ph] flows (00:21:25) historically, but we have so much work to do. That is my
emphasis. I believe that our loan book has not yet been fully tapped in respect to relationship lending, and the
Fiserv conversion that we embarked last year was a major core system conversion. But more importantly, our
cash flow management system is right on par with the largest commercial banks. So, there's no excuses that our
system does not compare to a capital one or a local commercial bank that we compete against. And so, we feel
very comfortable there. But we may have to tweak a little bit on the service side, tweak in the relationship lending
side. That will happen over time. But I think there's tremendous low-lying opportunity that we will aggressively go
after. So, I do hope that our customers are on the line here because we have a commitment. We want to bank
you full service, coming down to the lease – the lease amount that comes onto – the lease agreements we should
be getting as a matter, of course, the operating accounts and the full relationships. So, there's going to be a push,
I'd say for funding on a daily basis. Yeah, I think my staff is getting sick of hearing it, but that's where I'm at. I think
this is the opportunity to change the thrift model on the funding side and look at the pure commercial banking
opportunity within our customer base.
As far as new lines of businesses, I'd say it's going to be complementary to our customer base. We do lend
commercial and multi-family for these – these families. But lines of credit opportunities that arise, we're going to
thank them. But more importantly – and I say this with clarity, we are looking at all unique things in the
marketplace and we're very comfortable like we did with specialty finance, bringing in a team of people from the
outside, management list out. These are things that we're looking at today. We have no problem bringing on lines
of business that we're comfortable on managing as the credit risk. So, we are clearly looking to a diversification
over time. It's not going to be a build out from scratch. I can assure you that. I'm not going to make an
announcement that we're investing in the residential market and we're setting up a new residential portfolio. We're
going to partner. Partnerships will get it done a lot quicker and it will make rational sense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then, I guess, is your expense guide of $530 million to $535 million imply much hiring or will that be
incremental as you sort of over time go through...?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
You know, Mark, yeah, I'd say the big expense will come when we do something strategic. So, it's going to be
blended and an accretive opportunity. I'd say we're going to reshuffle the deck. We're looking at lines of business.
I'm going through the entire bank right now. We're going through all aspects of how we learn the processes. We'll
do some reshuffling, and look, maybe service – service people, fresh relationship people, but at the end of the
day, I think it's not going to be a material adjustment to those – the guide I gave you. I think it's going to be more
indicative towards revenue generation. So, I would say that that guide has some reshuffling internally. There will
be no real restructuring of the employee base. We're going to – we have a huge opportunity on the system side.
And we had a lot of people that can be utilized in other departments to work with the customer side. So, we're
going to try to find – catch a balance and hopefully keep the expenses tight in this difficult banking environment,
but also focus on revenue opportunities within the franchise. So, I think maybe we'll get a few hires here and there
down the road on the service, but ultimately, I want to reemphasize there's low lying fruit here that needs to be
picked and we will pick it.

Good morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning -- good morning, thanks for the question. Tom, maybe you could start with just the – the
change in the balance sheet in the securities portfolio and the cash position. Given the build in the quarter, how
should we think about the progression of that, the non-loans going...?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Chris, I'm going to defer this [ph] of course (00:25:10) to John. John, if you don't -- this question to John. Go
ahead, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Chris. So, we did – as Tom mentioned in his opening statements, we did add some cash and
started to increase our securities portfolio in the fourth quarter. Over the last couple of quarters and years, that
securities portfolio has drifted down pretty significantly to drop below 10% of securities assets. So, we wanted to
take advantage of the rate environment at the time, put on some term borrowings at the end of the fourth quarter
to enhance our liquidity position. And over time, put that into securities and partially into loans depending, of
course, on loan growth. And we expect to do that in the first quarter and into the first half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then on the strategic side, I mean, historically, acquisitions have been primarily funding-related.
I'm interested in, with the change in the leadership, are there opportunities for notable funding to drop under the
balance sheet and improve, or is it more of an asset availability today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would say a combination of both. I would tell you that we're looking at everything that's available. Deposit
opportunities are real, there -- they exist. We're going to be very carefully evaluating those opportunities as well

as businesses that focus on deposit gathering. But there's an interesting amount of unique opportunities out there
that have the ability to gather liabilities, either these are non-FDIC insured institutions or they have a business that
has a bank. They may own this type of business that is shredding that type of business, so clearly looking at
everything.
We have bid on stuff in the past, we've lost. We're not a [ph] what we call (00:26:48) an aggressive buyer of
anything, but we do look at a lot of stuff. And clearly, like I indicated, the deposit side of the balance sheet here, if
we refocus the energy, I believe we can get two to three multiple turn on the stock if we change our funding mix.
Being so dependent on wholesale finance as a thrift without doing a large transaction for over a decade impacts
on multiple. I believe as we turn that multiple into more of a core deposit opportunity, you can see a two to three
multiple turn and get that valuation back. So, we're razor focused there. Doesn't mean we're going to be
successful on winning opportunities, but we are very much looking at deposit opportunity as well as whole bank
M&A. I mean, there's no question that we're in an environment that mergers and acquisitions makes a lot of
sense, the scale is important. We believe we have a very unique system upgrade where other banks in our own
backyard have not done again. They're going to have to do it in the next two or three years.
So, it's very interesting just to join the family and within the systems here we can prosper together over time. I
think that opportunity exists, so we're excited about that. And I go back to the cash flow management solution,
that's really exciting, because historically that was some of the pet piece we've had where there was criticism on
not being able to have the same technology as some of the larger commercial banks. Well, now we have that
technology, no reason to not have the full deposit relationship.
So, we have a lot of enthusiasm on the systems side. Our people work very hard. This was a three-year project in
the making. So, if one is thinking about making this conversion, it's a three-year project. And we did it in the
middle of COVID. We actually closed the conversion in August of 2020, even though it was postponed year-after-
year to do it right, this was a major upgrade for the company, so we're excited about that, and this will help us on
consolidation as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then if I could, just given the newness of your seat in the internal focus, announcing a deal or a
strategic transaction, you'd be comfortable doing that kind of in the first part of the year given everything that's
going on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

I'm doing this a long time. I'm very comfortable on strategic business combination. This is not about ego, this is
about shareholder value and we will be very shareholder orientated. That's my history. That's my background. I've
been doing this for quite – for multiple decades alongside with Mr. Ficalora. And as you said, there's a new
leadership here and clearly, we put the egos aside, this is all about doing the right thing for shareholders.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed
with your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brock. I guess, we lost Brock.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Brock, is your phone on mute?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry about that. That always helps. So, good morning. I wondered if we could go to – go to expenses. I guess,
I'm struggling a little bit with the guide here which is very clear, and I just want to understand kind of what's
changed versus basically flat expenses or very little growth on the expense side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Look, I think Brock, there's no question and this is by the way slightly higher than the previous year. We had some
one timers last year. But the change in the run rate is that we have FDIC costs associated with banks that are
now – loans that are now criticized. We have a bucket of loans that went through COVID, went through the
CARES Act and we reevaluate those credits and they go into special mention substandard and we have to apply
an FDIC assessment against that risk. Very comfortable by the way managing that risk, very comfortable as far as
dealing with the loan books. However, there's a cost to that. So, I'd say the elevation of the FDIC alone has got to
be between $10 million and $12 million, minimum. And we hope that that starts to stabilize by first, second quarter
and then from there as these loans get back to filling their leases, getting tenants back into these units and/or
storefronts, you start to get them back into a lot – out of a watch class asset.
So, I think that's really what's driving year-over-year. At the same time, we've always been monitoring our
expenses. We're very efficient as a company. And I think we're going to see the benefit on an efficiency ratio
perspective, because the margins stronger, better efficiency ratio numbers. But clearly, going back to – I'll
reiterate, back to when we were trying to become a SIFI bank, our expenses were $660 million run rate, we
knocked it down to the low 5s, we're still operating at low 5s.
And with that investment that we made in systems and in risk management, we have tremendous back office
function that we built to be a much bigger bank. We have not yet grown the bank through acquisition. So, we were
very confident that when the opportunity arises, we have the back office and platform to leverage the expense
base.
But the guide is what it is. I think it's reasonable. Don't expect to see a major reinvestment because of the system
conversions is done. Money has been put into this system. There's opportunities, but they're going to be from time
to time maybe some small list outs from here, there, local banks that we can shake out some deposit gatherers
that we'll probably go after aggressively. And I don't think it's going to be meaningful enough to change my guide,
because I reshuffle within the organization.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And could you just revisit the GSE dynamic. We can see the – depending on your – I look at [indiscernible]
(00:32:16) for example, that's steepened pretty materially. It did so in Q4. What's driving that competitiveness?
And is some of it the fact that landlords are looking for any way to materially control costs, including interest costs,
given the aftermath of the Rent Act? Like, is that driving it or is it just the GSEs are backend big?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
A number of factors, right. I mean, obviously, let's start with rate, rate is rate. If you can get a coupon of sub 3%
and take it over I/O for 10 years, it's a competitive rate, right. So, if you think about how this process works, you're
going to size up a deal, let's say, with Q2, end of Q2 and closing in Q4. So, you really need to look at the rate
environment throughout the COVID scenario, right. So, I go back to what happened in the first quarter of 2020,
they were competitive and out of the gate, we still grew our portfolio Q1 of 2020.
And then Q2, we were in business with higher spreads, we fine-tuned our underwriting and we did some great
business, but the GSEs, I think, were distracted. First, it was COVID. It was figuring out how to remote originate.
Our guys have the ability to do paperless remote origination. That was a major upgrade for the company. That
was back in the end of 2019. We have the new-gen system, so it's all remote.
So, our people are open for business on a daily basis doing great originations, but we capitalized on Q2. And then
rates were generally low in generals in Q3. And that's why at the end of Q2, into Q3, I think a lot of the larger
customers looked at the market and said our rates are low, there's not a real – there's no real purchase and sale
activity. So, let's lock it along and put the money on the shelf with the GSEs and it's a competitive rate.
And by the way, we've competed with some of those great customers to ensure we don't lose that business. So,
we've had some large transactions. And we were the fierce competition in Q4, because we sized it up in the
middle of the year, give it anywhere from three to six months to close. And my guys are talking to shareholders
out, fall through the end of the year, was flat to down and we squeaked out some growth in Q4. So, we're very
pleased. But that was a fierce quarter in Q4.
And the good news today is that, when I speak to my lending people on a daily basis, it seems that we have not
sizable deals going away. We have a nice pipeline. We have a nice new money pipeline. So, we should be back
in the position of growth. And the GSE sold a lot of their coffers last year and they had to fill it at the end of the
year and they started from fresh again.
So, let's hope that we'll be competitive, but nothing new here. We've always competed with the government. And
if rates start to tick up, I think the product [ph] de jure (00:34:47) will be five and seven year money and the
spreads are healthy. If I can get 300 basis points or 275 to 300 basis points on five, seven year money on a risk
adjusted basis, we can do good business there, because the credit losses are de minimis. It's not zero.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please
proceed with your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steven. How are you? Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good. Thanks, Tom. I wanted to start, Tom, regarding your vision to improve the funding base of the company, it
sounds like you might need an M&A deal to move the needle. With that said, you no longer have a premium
currency. Are you still committed to a deal needing to be tangible book value accretive out of the gate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Look, holistically, we looked at that as value creation. So I would say to you, there's going to be two-pronged
approach. We're going to work within the franchise as we discussed within our own operations. We think there's a
tremendous low lying fruit opportunity. That's priority number one. We're open for opportunities. I mean, to change
the diversity of the lending book and try to take on new products that are new to the bank and really try to drive
this into a commercial enterprise, it'll be an M&A transaction that does so.
And depending on market conditions, I look at the environment historically is that we like to do transactions with
no premium type transactions, where tangible book value is preserved, but we could be flexible. I mean, at the
end of the day, if we could put a highly accretive transaction on the table and the earn-back is de minimis, we
would consider that. But I would still say fundamentally, taking tangible book value down is not the best idea of
creating value.
So, we'll be open to interesting ideas. It depends on the opportunity, right. It depends on the earnings power of
the partner. And I don't call them targets, I call them partners. We don't do targets, because at the end of the day,
we have to bring the people over from the other side to become partners. The best transactions are done when
you have partners at the table. We build – we build the table, everyone sits around who is our partner and if we
have good partnerships, you can create real value. I think that's the approach.
Nothing's changed here other than we had some leadership change. And as I said before, the reality is that we
run this company for our shareholders and we look at the opportunities in the marketplace. It's a shareholder
driven opportunity. There's been some large M&A transactions where low to no premium deals make a lot of
sense, especially with the technology build that's going on out there. So, we're very focused on doing the right
thing for our shareholders.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then on the deferrals, if I look at the $6 billion of deferrals that are now current or paid
off, were any of those rolled into the 6% of loans, I guess, around $2.5 billion that are now IO? And what types of
loans are in that $2.5 billion bucket of IO?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Absolutely. So, again, I'm going to go back to the point about the GSEs, a lot of these loans that went into IO also
could go to the GSEs on a 10-year IO structure. So no question, that was the market. And when we looked at the
loans that came off the CARES Act and literally they went back to payment side. That was fabulous. At the same
time, we're acknowledging that you have this unique phenomena, I'll call it the Manhattan phenomena, as the
cities starts to reopen. Of all the boroughs, Manhattan is having the most difficult time on this, we call it, getting
back to somewhat of a normal. If you look at Queens, Brooklyn and The Bronx, in particular, they're doing
extremely well. For us, I'd say the type of these assets, the ones that have more of a concentration of less rent
regulation, so they happen to have some more market type apartments. You have store fronts that are retail/office
that will have more difficulties in Manhattan than they would in Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island for sure.
So, the five boroughs, I'd say, the area that we see impact is Manhattan. And I'd say, of that portfolio, I'll just be
specific, $2.5 billion, you have approximately $1.6 billion multi-family and about $800 million of commercial CRE.
And on the office side is about $400 million and the retail is about $200 million and the LTV on the office 51%,
blended for all of the CRE is 54%. And if you look at multi, it's about 53%. And when you look at these on a cash
flow basis, as you apply a debt service coverage ratio on a casual basis, it's still north of a one for one. So, they
could pay, there's a service on. And they also can leave their bank and go to the GSEs if they choose to do so.
So, there's some of those types. There's others that have to lease up again and we're working through that,
utilizing the CARES Act and getting paid on a monthly basis.
As I said, we have 99% of all our loans are out of the non-pace status, which is pretty impressive, given the
pandemic. But more importantly, I think what I'm finding here when I dive into the portfolio and we mine the data,
you look at the fact that the higher percentage of loans that have less rent regulation of the ones that are the IO
potential, right, because the ones that have 100% rent regulation, they're paying, they're collecting and there's no
issue, which is – it's a resilient market for that niche business and we're going to continue being a dominant force
for portfolio in that niche.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. And maybe, if I could squeeze one more in, in your opening comments, you said everything was on the
table. And as we think about banking in the digital age, what's your view on preserving this local brand model
you've had for years versus maybe consolidating everything under NYCB? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I see that you're getting really deep there, so – okay. I'll tell you that, look, at the end of the day, given our
franchise, we have [ph] 246 (00:40:15) branches, we're in Arizona, Ohio, we're down in Florida, down south –
down in south, areas of South Florida, New York and New Jersey. We have a very unique brand. But we also
have a multiple brand concept, right? So, it all depends on the partner, it depends on the size of the transaction in
the markets. So, if it's a Florida transaction, well, that's easy. If it's a New York transaction, it's not going to be

more complicated. But again, it comes down to what's right for shareholders, right? What's best for the
shareholder? What makes the logical sense? And we're going to be very logical and we're going to be disciplined.
However, we have multiple brands in multiple markets. If you go into -- if you go to Ohio right now, we have Ohio
Savings Bank. That used to be AmTrust. We rebranded back to Ohio. Down in the South Beach Florida, it's
AmTrust. AmTrust has very well down there. It doesn't mean we're wedded to anything. The reality is that if we
are going to create something that's a regional platform, we have to do what's right for shareholders, makes the
most value creation. So, we're open to all opportunities.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
Robert Wann A
Director, Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Primarily, medallion driven on the charge-offs. On the provision we booked, which was lower than the third
quarter and has been the trend each quarter in 2020 with lower provisions. The macro environment did get a little
bit better. Housing prices got a little bit better. But we did have the increases in the classified and criticized assets
that Tom mentioned. So, from a qualitative perspective, we want to ensure that we cover those potential
increases. We don't see a huge risk of loss there, as John mentioned earlier. But from – from the CECL
perspective, we wanted to make sure we were covered.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
You know it's interesting, what John had said. I'll just follow up on that commentary. And usually, every quarter, I
kind of isolate the risk that we're seeing. And few quarters back, it was retail. Then I said, let's see, we'll watch the
office portfolio, but we're paying attention very closely to Manhattan. It is what it is. It's the last borrower that really
is having a difficult time. And if you look at where we are on sub-standard, special mention, it's 80% Manhattan,
right? I mean, isolate down to a handful of loans, all in is about $449 million of multi-family and about $300 million
of CRE broken out. We have literally an 80% split to Manhattan. So, I think that we have a good hands on this.
Historically is that when we do a Manhattan transaction, it typically is the lowest leverage we have on the portfolio,
historically as we've had in Queens. And when you look at the ones that migrate into what's called a classified
situation, the LTV on the multi is about – I believe that number is around 56% and the overall CRE portfolio on
LTV I believe is about 58% as well. So, yeah, for us, that's slightly higher than the 40% something. But for obvious
reason, it needs a little more help. And when you apply an IO structure to these loans, they continue to cash flow
out and also one for one for the most part, some don't, but for the vast majority do. And we're working through it.
But no one's knocking on the door and returning the keys.
They have real embedded value as well as very strong sponsors that are willing to work it out. These are not
CMBS pools. This is a unique way we lend. And if there's any risk at all, we tend to get a lot more folks into the
opportunity where we will have real strength upon the eventual liquidation. Believe me, there's plenty of people
who're loving to buy these assets, but they're not for sale. They they're working through a difficult environment
and they're paying interest only and we're getting – and they're all on payment status and they're paying their
taxes to the city. So, it's an encouraging outlook for us. I kind of ring fencing now to Manhattan and we're razor-
focused on it. And we believe that as the reopening starts to take place, hopefully sooner rather than later, this
should be hopefully the area that we'll talk about, hopefully by the end of the year, that's stabilizing. But there's no
guarantee that can happen, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Right. And just on those IO mods. Just kind of curious what the interest only period is and if you asked for any
additional collateral?

Typically, what we do is that the ones that came through the CARES Act and paid, they just continue, they go
back to P&I. And ones that need a little bit help, they requested that we offered six months. So, we'll take another
hard look at them, which on April and May again. The April and May comes around and I think that if the
reopening starts to take place, a lot of these guys are on the cusp of going to the agency too. So, we want them to
protect our business.
And like I said before in my opening comments, the agency is a fierce competitor. So, these -- some of these
loans could go there. Even though they are considered on a cusp of what we'll call a special mentioned type asset
because of the lease up of the ground floor in particular, but I think a lot of these loans are in a very good spot
where they actually can make these payments and protect the -- their assets from going to – or asset purchases.
There's a tremendous amount of money out there that would love to buy these assets in the events things go
sideways six months from now. So, right now, we're working through it.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And if I could squeeze one last question in, just on the securities purchases here for the
quarter, just kind of curious what are the yields – what kind of stuff in the yields you're purchasing these days?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's [indiscernible] (00:45:57) go ahead, John. Why don't you go ahead and expand upon it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, if you're looking at agency type paper, which is what we look at, you're in the mid ones, in the 150
range for good quality structured paper.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And if you think about, we have obviously tremendous amount of liquidity, we have $2 billion cash in the
balance sheet at zero. So, that's going to be deployed hopefully into our loan book as well as securities. So, in my
margin guide, I'm very conservative on the deployment of that excess cash, but we do have excess liquidity. We
put out some money long as a matter of taking advantage of the structure of the curve. We still have a lot of
wholesale finances that had to be restructured over time and going forward, even in this quarter, we have about
$325 million at 236 marked at 50 basis point. So, that's something that we look to probably lock in long and
instead of going overnight.
And then I think the next big slug of money comes in 2022, which is about $140 million, so we have time on that.
So, we're not going to be structure that, it's too far out of the money. And I think what's really interesting in 2020,
the beginning of 2022, is that we have $2 million on a macro hedge against fixed versus the float on the multi-
family side. If rates stay low for longer, we'll just remove it and that's another 10 basis points to 12 basis points on
our margin for 2022.
So, we're hedged there and as we grind through 2021, that will also be upside for the margin, depending on
interest rates. We may keep it on as rates are rising for some reason and we're in a strong economy and

everything is behind us. But my view is that that's probably not going to happen in 12 months and that hedge
could be something that's also beneficial to the margin.

Good morning, Ken.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning. Just in terms of the taxes, if given the change of the administration, if we do get a tax
increase, what does that imply for your overall tax rate and have you or can you do anything to kind of minimize
that hit versus in terms of tax strategies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, that's a pretty simple question. Obviously, if the rates go up, we pay more taxes. If that's possible, I think it's
more of a 2022 phenomena and I hope it's not a 2021 phenomena. But they took it to down to 21% and from
28%. There's a talk about 28% from a much higher level and that would impact a bank such as ours to a point
where is it going to be dollar for dollar, I would say that we're going to be very proactive on managing our tax
structure which we we're very focused on, but no question that higher taxes means less profitability, right, John, if
you want to add any comment to it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on new roles.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Tom, you had mentioned the NIM expansion beyond 1Q as well for the rest of this year, just wondering if
you think that 3 bps to 5 bps for 1Q were a good pace per quarter, given what you're looking at now and your
expectations on rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, you know me for long time. I don't give yearly guidance on the margin. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Just tried.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I know you tried. But I will tell you that a lot's going to depend on the shape of the yield curve. We had some
excitement in the fourth quarter with a bump-up in interest rates. I think that'll get the attention of many of the
customers. If it spikes significantly, this margin expansion could be outperform to what we expect, but meanwhile,
when we run models or running it conservatively, it's pretty much a flat curve environment and we're showing the
Q1 up a little bit here.
I think we probably lost about 2 bps on the excess liquidity. If we put it out fast, we'll get it back. As you know,
we've kept our securities portfolio below 10%, which is – if you look at the median peer group, that's probably the
lowest in the peer group, and it had to have a little bit of a bumpier as we positioned ourselves to go longer out in
the funding side and anticipate opportunities as we start to redeploy the balance sheet. And I don't think we're
going to take it significantly from there.
So, let's say, it goes from maybe 10% to 11%, but the cash position is very high right now, we'd like to put some
of that money to work and that's going to impact the margin hopefully favorably coming off of a zero return on
cash.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just on the loan side, where are you seeing new money yields now on multi-family
and...?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, the pipeline yield I believe – what's that, John, about 3.50%, new money pipeline?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
New money pipeline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...bear with me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right there, 3.50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Again, low-3s, competing tight on low-3s, durations is somewhat shorter, but we've been hovering around
3%. You apply that to the spread. It's a little bit tighter than we had liked, but I think it's coming off of the agencies'
desire to be more prolific on the lending side. That, again, the spread has been healthy between 2.75% to 3.15%
depending on the size of the order that we look at and I think we're getting that 3% net and that's important, but
the payoff was high. The last quarterly payoff was a 3.75% and originated 3.04%, we're still holding 3%. The
interesting modeling question we'd have, what happens in 2021 if the yield curve steepens, does that 3% go back
to 3.50%, if we see a nice spike in the back end. So, that could happen. There's no guarantee. We're modeling
more of a conservative scenario and we're still seeing margin expansion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. How much do you think you need the long end to move up before the GSE competitiveness does
start to decline?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think when you -- I really would spend time looking at the 10-year move, with the 10-year, the spreads between
2s and 10s start to move significantly here. I think customers will realize that economically it may make sense just
to go to the portfolio lenders and we're evaluating opportunities as far as synthetically getting them to stay with the
bank and swap opportunities. We do not have a specific swap program internally, something that we are
considering as a preventative edge to keep some customers from going to the GSEs to synthetically do that and
get some fees up front that's something that's on the table.
But no question that spread between -- I think Brock had said it between 2s and 10s where you spend time
evaluating. That has been a nice move in the fourth quarter. If that continues given the expectation of substantial
deficit spending and there's a view that rates are going higher in the back end, that will move customers back to
the five- and seven-year portfolio lenders space.

rate now...?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say it's 2.5 to 3.5 years anywhere from $48 million to $58 million, that spread.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, it's cheap overall funding. And if we can't bring it on the funding side, we will look to rebalance interest rate
risk by taking on an opportunity, which is three-year money around 50 basis points, which is pretty cheap.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. And just switching to expenses, that extra $10 million to $12 million in additional FDIC expense this
year that you mentioned, that should be dropping out of the run rate in 2022, right. Just hoping that you...
[indiscernible] (00:54:09)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It all depends on how bad the pandemic extend itself and does New York City reopens and does foot traffic start
and people go back to work and you'll see some pent-up demand to release. I think that's the key. And I think that
we're being at an abundance of caution, moving assets into a classified bucket as we should be doing. And then
the biggest consequence today on that is that, it costs us money on the on the FDIC insurance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. And then, on the loan growth outlook, I appreciate your thoughts there on the
multi-family side. I think it's a 3% to 5% there. What are your thoughts on the rest of the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I think we had a substantial reduction last year on CRE, just a matter of the market. That may be stabilizing a
little bit assuming that we look at other areas on CRE side, but as I say, CRE is flat to down 1% or 2%. I think
we're going to see a nice uptake on specialty finance given the amount that's outstanding and what's committed.
This is close to $5 billion committed and $3.8 billion outstanding. Is it $3.1 billion?

$3 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
$3 billion outstanding, it is a nice spread there of takedowns, we haven't seen the takedowns in Q4. We hope to
see more takedowns as we go into the year. So, they've had – their CAGRs have been off the charts since we
built that business, last year with a 17% CAGR. So, I expect nice growth, probably what – hopefully is consistent
to the previous year. That was probably one of our worst years with the pandemic. We grew 17%, so you want to
take a conservative look at that 17%, 15% to 18% there. And then you think about multifamily, if there is a change
in the yield curve, we are going to retain a lot more business.
And I think our guys have done an amazing job on retaining the business with data mining the portfolio. We're
working with the brokers. We're ensuring that we have a good fair shot at these customers before they leave to go
to the agency. And we'll be competitive. We have to do a little bit more IO absolutely, that's the market, but we're
going to be selective there. We try to be viewed as a hybrid IO lender, we're not big on long-term IO, but time to
time we make those decisions depending on the customer relationship and it's a positive relationship.
We did a very large relationship in Q4 that was IO because of a substantial depositary relationship. One of our
very strong customers was pricing us against the agency and we competed. And we lose a little bit on the risk
weighting side because it becomes a different risk weighting category. However, it's a great loan, great
relationship and tons of deposits with it. So, we have to be a fierce competitor in this environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then assuming that you guys continue to grow deposits, are you thinking that the securities growth
should continue as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I guess, I said on the security side and John may want to expand on it. Go ahead, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We would expect it would grow, but not dramatically from here. Given what the cash position is and the
securities, we expect maybe a little bit of growth in the first quarter and then hopefully keep it pretty flat from there
depending on deposit growth.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. No, that sounds good. And then maybe just one last one on fees. You had a good step-up there in
the fourth quarter. What's your outlook for fee growth in the first half or maybe just for 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We're assuming right now, it's pretty flat to the fourth quarter. We're not assuming a big increase to fees.
The third had a lot more of the fees wave during the pandemic than the fourth. But we're being conservative what
we're forecasting there. We don't expect a big increase. It'll probably be right around that fourth quarter number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Dave, that goes back to the point of the blank canvas. We don't have a lot of fee income.

Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, eventually, if you start bringing product, that's where the opportunity arise. We have a very large branch
structure where we don't sell a lot of products to the branches. So when you think about M&A and business
partnerships, that's where a tremendous opportunity. It's that blank canvas that we can paint with new products
going through the system. These are legacy branches going back, in some cases, to the 1800s that we really
have a lot of goodwill within the community that could have these lines of businesses that are normal commercial
bank lines of businesses that we don't have.

Good morning.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. How are you? Tom, with this focus on the target growth, what do you think you're going to
generate in terms of deposit growth this year and where do you think the loan-to-deposit ratio could go to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know I'm going to go there. It's just going to be a passionate push to look at processes, a passionate
push to look at the low lying fruit and we're going to update you guys on a quarterly basis, because it really is not
going to be a public plan. It's going to be an emphasis towards culture, right. And culture here has been uniquely
different when it come to the lending side versus the deposit side. I want to reiterate the concept that we have so
much low lying opportunity for these relationships that needs to be nurtured in mind, and obviously, showing the
technology that we had and we should win more business with the existing customer base. At the same time, as
we bring in new business, we did $12.9 billion originations last year. We should be able to get on every single
loan a deposit relationship as well as a potential full service deposit relationship. If we get 50% of it, we won. So,
I'm a guy about 100%, I like 100%. But if we get 50% there, we win. So, we do a lot of volume, Pete, as you know,
and the portfolio is relatively short.
What we found when we evaluated the book, there's a lot of customers that stay with us that are within other
portfolios because it's difficult to move all your accounts. And if you have a good relationship with a good
relationship manager, they tend to – it's not as portable if you can win over that business. So, I think we think
about the volume we do, thinking about the duration of the portfolio, truly opportunistic here and it's more cultural
and the culture has been clear. This is the liability term comes out of my mouth at least seven, eight times a day.

So, like I said on my opening comments, all options are on the table. We're very shareholder focused. We have a
very unique franchise. We have a diverse franchise when it comes to geographic and we can do a lot of things
with it. So, we're excited about opportunities. We're seeing a lot of great opportunities, both on the deposit side as
well as on strategic M&A.

Hi. Good morning, guys. Good morning. Just on the funding side here, recognizing that you are now focused on
growing core deposits. In the meantime, as your CDs and borrowings roll off, is there a preference between one
or the other?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
A combination of both for sure. I mean, we have $10.5 billion rolling off in 12 months at 79 basis points. This
quarter, we have $4 billion at 1.07%, markets between 40 and 50 basis points in the retail platform. Some of the
customers are not going to go into the CD instrument. They may just hide in the money market account at 2 basis
points – or 2 to 10 basis points. So, we rather have them go to the lowest cost of funds. And assuming that we're

not in a rising rate environment on the short end, they'll hide there for a while, and they may be opportunistic if
they want to take an 18 month CD or a 1 year CD, but the costs versus the wholesale market is pretty much on
top of each other.
So, either/or. We rather bring in, obviously, customer accounts for sure. But if you saw this transition of the
deposit base that where CDs went into money market and other hybrid funds that are viewed more as an
operating type account to lower cost, right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, yeah. And how much in borrowings is rolling off this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We have $325 million rolling off at a 2.36% coupon. And then, next quarter, I believe we have 393 basis points.
Very small in Q3, about $25 million. In the fourth quarter of the year, it's a decent sized amount of $373 million at
2.57%. But on average for the year, it's about $1 billion at 2.03%.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then just your strategy on the core deposit growth in the long-term. I guess, how are you thinking about doing
that with the brokers on the origination side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We've already had conversations. I'm not going to – we're not going to announce the secret sauce of that, but we
have great relationship with our brokers. And historically, it was about process and that we're going to change the
process internally. It's a matter of getting ahead of the closing. We close a lot of volume. Our loan box require –
we require the operating accounts and loan docs.
So, you waive a lot less than you do and you get them to the table and you get the relationship guys in front of the
customers at the closing table. When they want this $50 million to $100 million, they have to open up the account
and get the relationship going, instead of waving it. So, it's about repositioning and dealing with process and
people and that's the goal here. And that fine tuning alone will probably move the needle. At the same time, we
need to get this technology build out that we've invested in out to the customers to see what we have. And that's
indeed helpful...

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And was it the case before that you weren't able to do that because you didn't have the capabilities and now that
you do?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, absolutely not. I would say, it's twofold, right. We just did the biggest conversion of the Bank in August in the
middle of the pandemic under the Fiserv DNA core processing system. We've had partnered with Fiserv
throughout the entire platform for all our major systems that plug-in through Fiserv. So, we have a – let's call
ourselves a very strong partnership with Fiserv. We co-collaborated on the commercial side as well. So, the
commercial cash flow management solutions program that we have is a Fiserv product. It's a Fiserv product that's
used throughout the entire country. And that was not the same product that was there in July. So, this is a fairly
new opportunity that we believe is not an excuse that our systems is not compatible. So, I think we have a good
solution and now there's a push. And by the way, this hasn't been...

This is only since August, right? So, we're just starting the year. It's not even a year old, but we have this solution
and now it's a matter of getting the customers onboard, onboarding them, training them and focusing on the push
at the top level. This is at the board level, all the way down to the staff, this is where we should be going with the
franchise, getting away from the traditional thrift funding.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think I saw in the release, just curious what was the criticized and classified loan balances this
quarter versus last?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think we've disclosed that, John. I'll just give – I'll go to the sub-standard, we had – I think I went through that in
detail. We had a total of $449 million sub-standard in multi-family and we had a total of CRE at $314 million. Of
which, I believe identifies 80% being the Manhattan market. I think I went through the LTVs, but I'll go through
them again. The LTVs in that book is about 56% for multi and 58% for CRE.
And as I discussed, looking at that portfolio, a lot of these – most of these customers still, when we put some of
these customers in IO structure for six months, they are north of a one-for-one capacity to continue making these
payments. We will re-evaluate them as we get into the April/May period when that six month roll comes due and
see where they're at. And we're working with them. And clearly, like I said, Manhattan is the area of focus
because we see more of these loans coming out of the Manhattan market, not so much the other borrowers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
One thing you had mentioned, I just wanted a little bit more color on explanation. You mentioned the 2022 hedge,
the potential for that to roll off. Can you just remind me what that was, why it was put on the size, and how does it
benefit the NIM by 12 bps?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It was a $2 billion total notional hedge that we did that swapped from fixed to floating on our -- against our
loan portfolio in the last layer hedge. So, it was a three year swap that we did, so that matures in February of
2022. So, if we do not re-up or get into another transaction like that, we will see those loans which are right now in
essence pricing off a three month LIBOR go back to their fixed rate on our books. So, you'll see a big pickup on
that $2 billion back to the normal fixed rate of those loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would categorize as a entry risk hedge?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then the last one for me is just in regards to expenses, I hear you loud and clear. I
just wanted to make sure the message was that in terms of new hires or going into new verticals, you feel like
what you have in place, the $535 million in annual expenses, that's a good run rate and you feel like the NIE to
asset ratio sub 1% is a place that you can – that's something you can maintain?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think it's a fair estimate of where we are today and I feel comfortable with those numbers. I mean, obviously,
we're elevated on FDIC. We strive for a very strong efficiency ratio. I think we met our goals last year on efficiency
ratio despite uptakes and we've identified it what they were. And we had the FDIC cost, we had some medallion
related expenses as we took in some OREO pieces on the medallion side.
But going forward, bringing in some customer service people is not going to move the needle, reallocating
resources internally towards the concept of the push towards full relationship lending is, I don't – we're not going
to change the game somehow. This is not going to happen where we're going to change the product mix. The
product mix will change as we pick partners, right. But the low lying fruit will be harvested here and we're going to
work very hard in harvesting with the relationship with the brokers, the lenders, as well as our deposit gatherers,
together as a team and we're going to work as a team to try to harvest that low lying fruit that we've always talked
about, but now we're going to put into action.
And I think the system really helps us too. The systems conversion was extremely key for us. And I'm going to
reemphasize a lot of our competitors that I want to work on a serious system with the same vendor are going to
re-up down the road. So, doing it through while joining the family makes a lot more sense.

Operator: Thank you. Our final questions comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery
Scott. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking my question, Tom and John. I just wanted to ask about the deposits specialist that, Tom,
you alluded to. Would these be possible hires in other markets besides New York and is that a strategy to kind of
incent them well in this individually kind of stack up a team?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Absolutely. Ohio, Florida, Jersey, New York, [ph] Manhattan (01:10:35), we're going to be very proactive to try to
create value here by looking at these opportunities and no question that these people are portable. And we've
seen it happen in our backyard and most of our competitors are very successful at it. We're going to give it a shot
as well, but it's not going to be a major restructuring expense still. It's going to be done in a methodical way and I
think we have to just utilize the platform and the system. And ultimately, the true change will come when we paint
the canvas on new products and that will be full service commercial banking type products over time, typically
through a partnership.
And like I indicated, I think we've spent the effort on the conversion, we've spent the effort on getting our cash
flow management systems solutions correct. Now it's a matter of looking at what we have with the current existing
relationships, working with the brokers, working with the customer base and perhaps changing some of the type
of products within typical opportunity within a customer's book of business. We've always been multi-family and
CRE. No reason why they can't do lines of credit for these wealthy customers that want that and that's why they're
banking with another bank. And we don't have all their deposits. So, we have to be mindful of that. It's
opportunistic. That's not a difficult change for our system to win those types of products. Like is said, we're not
going to do a residential loan book from scratch, right. We're not going to open up a credit card business from
scratch. But if we have a unique opportunity within the M&A, but marketplace where people can bring
partnerships to the table, we would evaluate that. And then hopefully, have a full service branch platform there.
Right now, it's a very thrift like which over time – and I'm going to make a statement, people may not hear this, but
when you think about the traditional thrift model, I've never seen a thrift convert themselves organically doing it
successful. It has to be done through traditional M&A transactions that makes sense on a partnership perspective.
And I will never call it acquisitions, because acquisitions are difficult. Partnerships work, acquisitions could be
challenging. When you partner with the right partner that's willing to put their expertise on the table and their
wealth on the table, everyone has common goals.
