William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Brad, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today.
I don't think it's a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy, the
impact of interest rates on funding cost and this sort of post-March operating environment for our industry are
impacting our results and plans.
Truist, though, was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and
commitment to all stakeholders. Capital and liquidity have taken on an increased focus, and although Truist is
currently well-positioned, we're also intentionally building future flexibility. This environment also challenges us to
move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and right-size our expense chassis to reflect the
new realities.
We also have flexibility and strength in our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and
market opportunity. These decisions are less incremental and more time bound than the ones previously made
during our shift from integrating to operating. Mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments, and I'll
close with some of the underlying momentum.
While these changes will be manifested over time, this is not business as usual and reflects an important and
significant pivot for Truist and for our leadership team. We'll provide more details about these topics in our second
quarter results throughout the presentation.
But before we do that, let me start where I always do, on slide 4, on purpose, mission, values. Truist is a purpose-
driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities, and I'd like to share some of the
ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter.
In May, we announced the launch of Truist Long Game, our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to
reward clients for building financial wellness. At a high level, users set goals, save money and earn rewards that
are deposited into a Truist account as they make progress toward their savings goals. Based on early data, users
tend to play four to five times a week with strong retention, and we've seen positive trends towards new client
acquisition. This is also the first product from our Truist Foundry, our very own startup tasked with creating digital
solutions to help meet clients where they are.
Truist has also highlighted small business owners through our Small Business Community Heroes initiative, which
is all about focusing on the small business owners who work tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs and
build our communities and help drive our economy.
Our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank
you and have a caring conversation to assist with their unique needs. The response so far has really been
excellent and our outreach efforts has helped drive a 31% increase in net new small business checking accounts
during the second quarter alone.

Lastly, I want to thank our teammates who dedicated more than 16,000 hours during the second quarter to
volunteer in their communities. I'm really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to
live out our purpose, and they make a difference in the lives of their clients, teammates and communities.
So, let's turn to the second quarter performance highlights on slide 6. Second quarter results were mixed overall.
Net income available to common in the second quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.92 a share. EPS decreased 16%
relative to the year-ago quarter primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense partially
offset by higher net interest income. EPS decreased 12% sequentially as higher funding cost pressured net
interest income.
Total revenue decreased 2.9% sequentially, consistent with our revised guidance. And a 6.1% decrease in net
interest income was partially offset by 2.6% increase in fee income, led by record results at Truist Insurance
Holdings. Adjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range, although we're actively working to manage
cost even more intensely.
Loan balances were relatively stable, and we're pleased with the initial progress we've made to reposition the
balance sheet for higher-return core assets especially in consumer but there's always additional work to do.
Average deposits were down 2% largely due to client activity in March. Though overall deposit trends have
stabilized significantly since that timeframe and our conversations with our clients and pipelines have improved.
We're also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty. At the same
time, our CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis points, driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a 20%
stake in our Insurance business. These same factors drove a 5% increase in tangible book value per share on
March 31.
Our insurance capital buffer increased from 250 basis points to 290 basis points, higher than we think our steady
state business model warrants, but still a good performance as Truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rate among
traditional banks that participated in the stress test, reflecting again our conservative credit culture and diverse
loan portfolio. We also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 a
share, subject to board approval.
Strategically, we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses,
which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio at net carrying
value, which has no upfront P&L impact. We're also making solid progress towards shifting our loan mix towards
higher-return core assets.
As we adapt to the current environment, we're highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise, simplifying
where it makes sense, rationalizing our expenses and building capital, all of which we'll address later in the
presentation.
Moving to the digital and technology update on slide 7. Digital engagement trends remain positive, reinforcing the
importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy, client
experience and account growth.
As a proof point, we recently enhanced our digital onboarding experience through a series of platform
enhancements resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications, faster funding and higher average digital

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
account balances. Our growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes. Digital
transactions grew 5% sequentially and now account for 61% of total bank transactions.
Zelle transactions increased 12% compared to the first quarter and now account for one-third of all digital
transactions at Truist, which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money
movement capabilities.
Retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their pre-merger highs. We're proud of our third place
ranking in the Javelin 2023 Mobile Banking Scorecard.
From an overall client experience and technology perspective, we continue to enhance our capability set. That
includes recent improvements to our cloud-based self-service digital assistant, Truist Assist. Since implementing
these enhancements several months ago, Truist Assist has hosted over 500,000 conversations with more than
380,000 clients and has connected clients to live agents to support more than 100,000 complex needs via live
chat. Over time, increased utilization of Truist Assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers.
We're also delivering on our commitment to T3 due to launch of our Truist Insights to our Small Business heroes
earlier in this month. Truist Insights empowers small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial
activities, including cash flows, income and expense, and proactive balance monitoring. We first piloted Truist
Insights in 2021 and this year alone have generated over 200 million financial insights for more than 4.5 million
clients and we're now delivering best valuable tool to Small Business.
This is just one more way we're bringing touch and technology together to build trust and help our Small Business
clients bank with confidence where and how they want. Overall, I'm highly optimistic that our investments and
innovation in digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience.
Let me turn to loans and leases on slide 8. Loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress we've
made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from
lower yielding and certain single product relationships. Average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth
in our commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances. Commercial loan growth was driven
by seasonality and mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional C&I, which is a core area for
us.
The decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where we've intentionally reduced
production. Home equity, residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined and I'll provide more
details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments.
At the same time, we're seeing strong results from our Service Finance and Sheffield businesses, where second
quarter production grew 34% and 21%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Service Finance continues to
perform very well and take market share. And consistent with our balance sheet optimization, we'll increase our
loan sale opportunities to help support its growth.
As I mentioned, we made the strategic decision to sell our $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio, which had
been running off at a pace of approximately $400 million per quarter. We sold the student loan book in late June
at net carrying value with no upfront P&L impact. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale
funding. The transaction will modestly hurt NII, but boost NIM and balance sheet efficiency, exactly what we
should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully.

Going forward, we'll continue to better focus our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships
while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity
overall of our balance sheet.
Now, let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on slide 9. Average deposits decreased $8.7
billion or 2.1% primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were
consistent with industry impacts of quantitative tightening.
We continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 31%
of total deposits from 32% in the first quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing deposit costs
increased 55 basis points sequentially and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 44%, up from 36% in
the first quarter, due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest-
bearing accounts to higher-yielding products. We continue to [ph] make (00:12:58) a balanced approach in the
current environment, being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value
outside of rate pay.
Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments are the bull's eye of our
sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships, deepen existing ones
and maximize high-quality deposit growth.
Now, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with net interest income on slide 10.
For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 6.1% sequentially as higher funding costs more
than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets. Reported net interest margin decreased 26 basis points
to 2.91% due primarily to an acceleration of interest-bearing deposit betas and mix shift out of DDA into other high
cost alternatives. The lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter. While
liquidity remained elevated throughout April and May, it has normalized by June and will provide some modest
boost in NIM going forward.
On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is still up 7.1% and core net interest margin is up 13 basis points.
This reflects the cumulative benefit we've seen from the rising rates during the cycle, particularly throughout 2022,
but now we are losing some of that benefit in 2023.
Moving to fee income on slide 11, fee income rebounded 2.6% relative to the first quarter. Insurance income
increased $122 million sequentially to a record $935 million, demonstrating the strength of Truist Insurance
Holdings. Year-over-year, organic revenue grew by 9.1%, the highest in four quarters, driven by strong new
business growth, improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop.
Other income increased $65 million primarily due to higher income from our nonqualified plan and higher other
investment income. In contrast, investment banking and trading income decreased $50 million, reflecting lower
bond originations, loan syndications and asset securitizations, as well as lower core trading income from
derivatives and credit trading. Finally, mortgage banking income decreased $43 million, with most of the decrease
related to prior-quarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Turning to noninterest expense on slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $67 million or 1.9%
sequentially. The increase in adjusted expenses reflected a $75 million increase in personnel costs due to higher
variable compensation and nonqualified plan expense and a $38 million increase in professional fees associated
with enterprise technology and other investments. These increases were partially offset by a $41 million reduction
and other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter.
As a company, we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating
expense reductions. On the April earnings call, we discussed a strategic realignment within our fixed income
sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by
middle market fixed income platforms that had an unattractive ROE. We also identified various expense reduction
activities that had already been underway, including realigning our LightStream platform to our broader consumer
business and ongoing capacity adjustments to market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage.
We're actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of
the next 12 to 18 months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions.
These actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards FTE management, realigning and
consolidating businesses to advance our long-term strategy, rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient
and effective delivery, and optimizing our operations and contact centers, which will help us transform Truist into a
more effective and efficient company. Taken together, we believe these actions will increase our focus, double
down on our core, simplify our business, bend the expense curve, and enhance returns for our shareholders.
Moving to slide 13. Asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter.
Nonperforming loans rose 11 basis points primarily due to increases in our CRE and C&I portfolios, though they
remain manageable at 47 basis points. While the increase in CRE nonperforming loans include some office, these
loans are generally paying as agreed. Our net charge-off ratio was 54 basis points, inclusive of a 12-basis point
impact from the sale of the student loan portfolio. Excluding this student loan sale, net charge-offs were 42 basis
points, up 5 basis points sequentially. We'd also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision
expense this quarter, as the charge-off taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance
on the portfolio.
During the quarter, we also increased our ALLL ratio 6 basis points to 1.43% due to greater economic uncertainty.
Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas,
though we maintain our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients.
Next, I'll provide more details on our CRE portfolio which takes us to slide 14. On June 30, CRE, including
commercial construction, represented 8.9% of loans held for investment while the office segment comprised only
1.6%. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection.
We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through
multiple cycles. Our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that has strong institutional ownership
and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolios since the close of the merger.
Looking at office in particular, the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our office portfolio by tenant
and class. Our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multi-tenant Class A properties that are situated
within our footprint, all factors that we believe will drive outperformance.
In addition, we have a strong CRE team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the
problems. During the second quarter, we completed a thorough review of the majority of our CRE office exposure.
We considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach. As a result, a handful of loans
7

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
were moved to nonaccrual, though the preponderance of the clients in exposure are paying as agreed. We
believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive
and early identification and resolution of credit risk.
While problem loans have increased in recent months, we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our
lighter maturity profile, conservative LTVs and reserves, which for office totaled 6.2% of loans held for investment.
Turning to capital on slide 15. As you can see from the capital waterfall, Truist is well-capitalized and has
significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment. Beginning on the left,
CET1 capital increased 50 basis points to 9.6% at June 30. This was driven by organic capital generation and the
completion of the sale of the 20% stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. I would also point out that at 9.6%, we're
well above our new regulatory minimum of 7.4%, which takes effect on October 1.
We expect to achieve an approximate 10% CET1 ratio by year-end through a combination of organic capital
generation and disciplined management of RWA growth. This view does contemplate the headwind from the
pending FDIC assessment. On top of this, Truist has more than 200 basis points of additional flexibility, given the
residual 80% ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings.
As we look beyond 2023, we do expect regulatory and capital requirements to become more stringent and
potentially require us to deduct AOCI from our CET1 ratio. While the final form of any regulatory changes remains
to be seen, Truist is well-positioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phase-
in periods of any potential new requirement.
Specifically, and as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, based on estimated cash flows and assuming
today's forward curve, we would expect Truist's AOCI to decline by 36% by the end of 2026. Assuming our
current rate of organic capital generation remains constant, Truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the
estimated remaining impact of AOCI on CET1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital
flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings.
And now I will review our updated guidance on slide 16. Looking into the third quarter of 2023, we expect
revenues to be down 4% due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances, which will
lead to continued pressure on net interest income, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced
in the second quarter.
Adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline 0% to 1%, as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our
efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits
that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% compared to 2022. The decline from our
previous outlook for 3% growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas, slower
loan growth and lower investment banking revenue.
Adjusted expenses are expected to increase 7%, which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to
continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas. This excludes the anticipated FDI fee surcharge.
This is a number that is higher than where we've been targeting, but as we've discussed, we are pursuing a
number of actions to reduce costs.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
In terms of asset quality our expectation is for the net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points,
which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 19%, or 21% on a
taxable equivalent basis.
Now, Bill, I hand it back to you for some final remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great, thanks Mike. So let's conclude on slide 17. We're on the right path. I'm highly optimistic about our ability to
realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to
provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. Our strategic pivot from
integrating to operating is well underway. And while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the
rapid increase in funding costs from related revenue pressure, we've made significant strategic progress over the
past year and it's showing up in a number of operating metrics of our business.
In our Consumer Banking and Wealth segments, retail small business banking net new checking production has
been positive during four – past five quarters, reflecting the success of Truist One and improved retention
associated with our increasing client service metrics. Truist One also has many features that appeal to millennials
and Gen Z represent 70% of the new client applications.
Our well-trusted brokerage business continue to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the
impact of market value changes, have been positive eight of the last nine quarters. We've also steadily improved
client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents, as well as
improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey routes. As a result, our
client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter, but
have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration.
In Corporate and Commercial, we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our
CIB and CCB businesses. During the first half of the year, 25% of the left lead transactions closed by Truist were
with our CCB clients. We're also making inroads with new CCB clients as 65% of the CCB left leads I just
mentioned were new relationships.
In equity capital markets, transaction economics have improved approximately 300 basis points on average since
the merger. And in wholesale payments, our pipeline's the highest it's been since the merger. Each of these data
points reflects our increasing strategic relevance with our clients.
In addition, our IRM program, Integrated Relationship Management, is off to a great start this year, as we've
already delivered nearly 50% more IRM solutions year-to-date than during the same period a year ago. Our
strong progress demonstrates what is possible post-integration when our teammates can focus their undivided
attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships.
However, just as we're shifting our focus from integrate to operate, the economic landscape shifted from favorable
to more challenging. As a result, we too must shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of today's
economic environment and tomorrow's regulatory requirement. This means being more disciplined about where
we choose to compete and deploy our capital with our businesses, clients or products, and looking deeper at
more structural cost opportunities that exist at Truist.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
These opportunities exist but were not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on
creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates. Mike highlighted many of the specifics earlier.
While the details are critically important, what will ultimately matter to stakeholders is our absolute expense base
and growth, and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory.
I'm really truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose, our talented
teammates, leadership and growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and
fulfill our potential.
So, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps
Head-Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill. Sharon, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session.
As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up
in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks, good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to follow up. Of course, it makes sense that the funding cost
since lower loan growth is part of the change in the revenue outlook. Just wondering, as you look forward and you
think about that deposit mix and deposit cost trajectory as far as funding cost looking past the second quarter,
how do you see that affecting the NII trajectory within that new revenue guide for third and fourth? Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, good morning, Ken, it's Mike. I'd say as we think about the rest of the year, the same factors that have
been driving I'd say just average balance, QT primarily in the second quarter, we had a little bit more of an impact
from tax payments, will continue. The mixing has been pretty consistent too from a noninterest-bearing demand
perspective into higher cost alternatives. We saw a little bit of an acceleration in the first quarter as you'll recall,
but this quarter that stabilized a bit. We were down about 5.5% on those balances and remix from I guess 32% to
31%. We would expect that trend to continue as well.
I think really the factors as we think about NII trajectory for the third and the fourth quarter has much more to do
with sort of the Fed policy track, right? We had about a call it close to 50 basis points average increase in the Fed
funds rate in the second quarter, which really did have an impact on our betas and our funding costs. We would
expect that to be about half that in the third quarter and further moderating from there.

And just on the follow-up, what do you think that means for the kind of the view of work you think terminal interest-
bearing beta might land?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
It's tough. We're at 44% today. That's higher than where we expected to be. I think we, as recently as a month or
so ago, expressed an expectation that maybe mid to high 40s would be the case. I think certainly piercing 50%,
but really hard to pick a number at this point, Ken, to be honest with you. A lot of it I think has to do with how long
we're higher for longer.

Ken Usdin Q

Operator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess maybe first question, Mike, just following up on what your response to Ken around just the
change in deposit beta expectation [indiscernible] (00:31:17) to last month. Are they – like when we think about
what you said on deposit beta outlook, are there any real signs that are suggesting that deposit trends are in fact
slowing down and the likelihood of the deposit beta update you provided today is more likely to play out versus
having to change this again next month? I'm just wondering, are you seeing any tangible signs on the ground that
suggest things are getting better?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
We look at it on a weekly, monthly basis, Ebrahim. And so, I think, yeah, I mean, I think history would say that as
we approach and reach this terminal policy rate, we should start to see some moderation in the beta creep. We're
starting to see that a little bit, but a month or a few weeks a trend does not make, and so just being very cautious
on the outlook there. I mean at [ph] 5.25% going to 5.50% (00:32:12), the degree of rate awareness across our
client set is very, very high, across the industry is very, very high. And so, look, and I think that's probably as
much as anything driven the miss on betas for the sector so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess a specific question you've talked a lot, both you and Bill throughout the call around wanting to
bend the cost curve and the expense focus. I know you're not giving 2024 guidance today, but as we think about
the opportunity there, I'm just wondering if you can put some framework around what we should expect around
what this entails with regards to just quantifying it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll take that and without again trying to sort of provide specific guidance because we're – have a lot of
things that we're working on. If you think about sort of the buildup, so the buildup was related to things that are
11


Truist Financial Corp.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
investing to build a large financial institution. And then we had some unique onetime things to us that are things
like pension accounting and by the way acquisitions as part of that.
So, I'd say a couple of things. I mean, we're clearly at an inflection point in the growth rate. So the growth rates
kind of change materially and you can sort of see that by our guidance for the year relative to where we are right
now. So that will give you of an impression of where we think the third and fourth quarter will be from a growth
perspective. And I think similarly sort of on an absolute basis for the balance of this year, we would expect to see
some of that absolute level of expenses coming down.
But the real change comes in the structural opportunities that Mike talked about and the things that we're working
on. So we can bend the curve in lots of ways that are incremental, but I think the big opportunity for us is sort of
the fundamental components in terms of how our company is structured, to how it runs, what the chassis looks
like, what are the businesses that we're in. And that's the work that we're doing. That's the big work of post
integration to running the company in a way that reflects the current environment.
So what I would say, maybe I'll use the word appreciably. So expenses will be down appreciably. And as we get
into this latter part of this year, we'll provide a lot more guidance about 2024.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning and I apologize in advance that it feels like everyone's asking the same question, but I think it's
important for your investors to have clarity. Mike, just on the net interest income trajectory, I apologize that we're
asking you to spoon-feed it to us and for everybody to model it later, but investors are really thinking about what
the exit rates for the fourth quarter will be potentially overlay your net interest income sensitivity that you disclosed
in your 10-Q, which at down [ph] 100 basis points (00:35:26), just down 70 basis points would imply pretty good
stability from fourth quarter level. So, I guess I'm wondering from the $3,679, what is the range of NII outcomes
that you expect for the fourth quarter? And do you agree with that notion that if the Fed does cut 100 basis points,
which a lot of investors are putting in their models, there is going to be relative stability in terms of your net
interest income power next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, Erika, I don't mind at all the follow-up question here. So, a couple things, yes, I mean, look, we are,
according to our NII sensitivity disclosure, relatively neutral. And I'd say based on where we are in the cycle and
how, in particular, betas are performing, we're probably even a little bit more liability sensitive to that – than that
and you see that in our results.
We're not currently contemplating a cut this year. And when we talked about our expectations in the middle of
June, we were thinking about a cut as early as this year. We've updated our rate view to a up [ph] 25 basis points
(00:36:41) at the next meeting and then holding until probably mid-2024. So, that probably is what's influencing
our revenue guide for the rest of this year and especially the NII component. But, yeah, I mean, just to get to your
12


Truist Financial Corp.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
question, if we saw a down [ph] 100 basis points (00:36:56), that would absolutely be a stabilizing force and would
be a nice tailwind for our NII based on how we're positioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And within your guide – go ahead, Bill.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, let me just add a couple things, because we're really talking about sort of betas and NII and we also
need to shift to talk about client and client activity, which is also an important part of this. So, the tailwind that
we're creating about net-net deposit growth, expansion, IRM, primacy with relationships.
And then, on the pricing side, I mean we're starting to see some of that pricing flexibility, particularly on the
commercial side. So, spread over SOFR probably 20-some-plus basis points quarter-to-quarter. So, the ability to
be more relevant to our clients, reposition our portfolio to reflect that, be in the higher returning, quite frankly
taking some market share where others are backing off, we're leaning into some opportunities that have greater
return for us. So, in addition to all the betas and the other components, there's just a lot of really good underlying
client activity that's tailwind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just a follow-up question and then I'll step aside. Mike, I guess let me ask this a different way. Within
the down – or up 1% to 2% in terms of adjusted revenue, what is the NII outlook embedded there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, no problems. So, our expectation is that in the third quarter, with a single rate hike, we'll continue on
a downward trajectory, but at a much more moderate pace, call it half of what we saw in the second quarter. And I
think you would expect the pressure to decline even further in the fourth quarter.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks so much. Just one quick follow-on to this discussion regarding the noninterest-bearing component. I
know you mentioned earlier that you expect the noninterest-bearing to remix, to stabilize here. And I'm just
13


Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
wondering, in your NII outlook, where you're expecting noninterest-bearing to trend and where do you feel that
that will stabilize? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
It's been remixing at about 1% a quarter for us, that was about $7 billion on average balance and 5.5% in the
quarter. I would expect that trend to continue at that rate. We spent a lot of time last quarter talking about where
that might ultimately land. I think there's a chance that that rate of 1% or whatever 5% to 6% a quarter does begin
to moderate some here. Bill and I both talked about sort of maybe it's a mid-20s terminal mix of DDA. But even
that I think is, in many respects, an estimate and trying to rely on pre-pandemic and even pre – back to the pre-
GFC proxy.
So, Betsy, I don't know if that helps or not, but we are assuming that DDA will continue to decline in the third and
the fourth quarter. Again, the second quarter is a little tougher because of the tax payments and the likes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then, just shifting the conversation a little bit towards capital, I see your slide 15
on the significant capital momentum and flexibility that you've got. Maybe you could just frame for us how you're
thinking about what's the right level for you as we're thinking through what regulation could come through here
next week. Supposedly, we're going to have some new proposals come out. And then, give us a sense as to
buyback capacity and where you're thinking about that at this stage. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, it's Bill. So, I think the position right now is we continue to build. And so, the targets are developing,
more information is coming. We'll know more over the next 90 days in terms of different proposals and impact on
us.
And really what the slide was meant to do rather than show sort of an absolute level or a target was really to show
the flexibility and the organic creation of capital that we have. So, we start from a good position of 9.6%. We'll be
organically at 10% end of this year without sort of doing anything dramatic related to risk-weighted assets, sort of
staying on the process that we're on. And then, we just have a lot of flexibility that the AOCI sort of runs off and
then we have – and we just have other flexibility.
So, we'll know more as it develops, but I think we're in the left lane of capital accretion and we'll stay in that mode
until we're not. And that same thing applies to any buybacks or whatnot. We sort to have to understand where the
stopping point is before we make any comment about buybacks and today that would be short term not on the
table as we're building capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. The floor is yours.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I want to recognize that accelerated capital path CET1 10% by year-end, so certainly progress with capital.
But otherwise, Bill, I need help in understanding how you can say you're on the right path. One, you had a
merger, and end-market merger, an end-market merger predicated on cost synergies, and here we are over three
years later and your efficiency ratio in the second quarter is 63% worse than peer.
Second, your new guide is for 2023 negative operating leverage of 500 basis points to 600 basis points, and to
boot, the revenue guide was lowered by 500 basis points than your expense guide. What's the high end of your
prior range? Your personnel expense were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year.
And then, three, you talked about bending the cost curve, but over the past three years, you mentioned when the
hood was open, you said let's invest more, then it was investing more for growth. Now here you say you're
investing more in enterprise tax.
So from the – the merger is predicated on cost synergies, the guidance for big negative operating leverage, you're
still spending more. So I understand employees should be happy; they're being paid more. The customers are
happy, you have strong relationships. The communities are happy that you're immersed in them. But the
shareholders I think I can safely say are not happy, I mean not happy about the expense growth and they're not
happy about the negative operating leverage. And it just seems like I love you personally, but I just wonder if you
could spin a little too soft and not taking the tougher actions like some of your peers have. So correct my logic or
thinking or my observations, if you would.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks. Thanks, Mike, and I appreciate the love that you have, right back at you. So, I think that – so a couple of
things, one is maybe I'll challenge a little bit that merger was predicated on cost saves alone. Remember that
merger was predicated on opportunity as well and opportunity in that market. So, we want to make sure that we're
well-positioned to take advantage of those.
So when I talk about sort of being on track, I don't want you to think that that satisfaction about where we are from
an expense side. Building the infrastructure for a large company in this environment was more expensive than we
anticipated, so there's just no doubt about that.
But to that point, I think we're at a really good inflection point, and that inflection point is a pivot. The intensity I can
assure you here around expenses, but not just expenses but just redesigning the chassis. I mean, there are lots
of easy things you can do, you can do hiring freezes and those types of things, and we are underway on all that
and you'll start to see some of that over the next couple of quarters. But our commitment is to really underchange
the fundamental structure and the business model that results of this. So, there's certain businesses, we talked
about student loan would be an example that we've been supporting from an expense standpoint but just doesn't
fit into our strategy and doesn't makes sense. And we'll evaluate other parts of our business and other parts of our
support structure that are part of that.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
You could argue we should have been doing that faster. I think that's a legitimate push and I accept that, but I
don't want you to think that's it's not happening and the focus is intense, but it is about trying to create more
permanent change than structural. I mean, let's make the next quarter lower. Let's really change the fundamental
structure of the company from an expense standpoint.
You've seen me do it before and you know we can do it again. So, my confidence comes from the fact that we've
got a team that's committed to this and the plans that I see and the focus that we have. This is an inflection point
from that standpoint in this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, you mentioned your comeback was in plan for 12 to 18 months and I know – look, I know you wanted to have
positive operating leverage and the environment worked against you partly. And as you acknowledged, there is
some other things internally. But it looks like we talked to get positive operating leverage in 2024, is that
something you're going to shoot for and when do we hear about this new expense planned over the next 12 to 18
months? You gave us a longer list earlier and what sort of magnitude might that be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, we'll start talking about that in the next couple of quarters, Mike, and how they fit into the overall structure.
As I've said to you before, we have every business unit has a positive operating leverage plan. I mean, that's what
we've asked them to do is to create plans that are unique to their businesses. But what we need to do in addition
is to have sort of the enterprise positive operating leverage focus.
2024, we'll just have to see how it plays out. I mean there's a lot of economic factors that will determine that. So,
I'd say not throwing in the towel, so to speak, but we just have to see where some of the economics lay out as it
relates to that.
So, if we're in a different rate environment, we're in a different investment banking environment, we're in a
different, then I'll have a different view on that. But as I sit here today, it's a tough climb, but what we want to do is
build that capacity for the long term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last short follow-up. I asked this everybody. The NII guide is much lower for you and for others. Do you
think you've captured it all here? I mean do you [ph] lead (00:48:42) the year at that kind of fourth quarter level
and that's it or do you see more downside after that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
As far as the year is concerned, look, we've lifted it higher for longer, the new guide reflects how betas are
performing. So, I think we feel like we've got it for the year. As far as trajectory and trough in 2024, it's just I think
it really is going to be rate path and policy dependent. So long as we're at these rates and for longer, betas are
going to keep creeping.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Now, the good news is we are seeing and Bill mentioned there's some improvement on things like credit spreads
and re-pricing assets, et cetera, but I think so long as we stay at, whatever, 5.25%, 5.5% or there's a risk if there's
a second hike, for sure, Mike, to our outlook. But no, I think we've got Q3 and Q4 pretty well-pegged.

Operator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit. Could you talk a little bit about the asset quality trends
you saw this quarter and what drove the increase in non-performers, particularly around C&I and CRE?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
John, I'll turn it over to Clarke, but just there's not a trend. So, a lot of idiosyncratic things, but let me turn it over to
Clarke to go do a little more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Bill, and thanks, John. So, I would just say we had a number of moving pieces this quarter from a
credit perspective and a lot of that was intentionality around actively managing the portfolio.
So, the takeaways I would give you are, first, we had really solid consumer performance overall with lower NPLs
and losses versus our forecast. So, the consumer is holding up really well. So, where we did see some impact to
your point is in the C&I and CRE books. From a C&I standpoint, we did see some uptick in NPLs and losses. But
what I'd tell you is more episodic, there's no particular trend or segment issue as Bill said. And we're coming off
really low historical numbers and so even where we are today would be lower than our long-term numbers.
As far as the NPL increase, most of that was driven by an intentional focus on CRE office. So, what we did is we
did an intense loan-by-loan review of almost our entire book. So, I'll just give you some color on Q1. In our
community bank, we looked at all office loans greater than $2 million. And in Q2, we looked at everything over
$25 million.
So, we've done a loan-by-loan review with the vast majority of all of our CRE office. That included updated risk
assessments in view of valuation. So, we worked really, really hard to make sure we're not kicking the can down
the road and we understand where we are.
So, as a result of that, we put a few loans on non-accrual. I would tell you that the predominance of those loans
are actually current. They're swap to maturity from a rate standpoint and they've got good economic risks. We're
trying to stay focused on their ability to exit at maturity. And so, we're looking and making sure we fully understand
that.
So, that drove the increase in the NPLs and then we did recognize that with a 6 bp increase in our allowance and
so our office allocation is up [ph] 6 bp in the (00:52:23) overall. So, we feel really good about that.
17


Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
So again, I would say the takeaway is we worked really hard to make sure we have good visibility in the portfolio
and the good news is our overall guidance for losses really didn't change. We included our student loan impact for
Q2, but we maintained, otherwise, our loss guidance for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, Clarke, what should we think about in terms of maybe the charge-off
trajectory in the back half of the year that's embedded in the guidance relative to the 42 basis points I guess
jumping-off point here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, again, we're very confident we'll be within the range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the entire year.
And I would just remind you all that the second half of the year is always seasonally high in our consumer
businesses, particularly in our subprime auto. And so, that's why you see the range stay in the 40 basis points to
50 basis points range. So, it will be higher than Q2, but within the guidance we've given you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the efficiency side of things, I know I heard around the efficiency program that you're working
on and looking to bend the cost curve. How should we think about long-term efficiency for the company? As
you're looking at this program, as you're looking at this quarter being the inflection and you're apparently clearly
looking at it across businesses, how should we think about what the prudent – the appropriate efficiency ratio is
and the long-term perspective that you're likely to target here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, John, it's Bill, I'll take that. What I said was, obviously, is that the expense growth is going to decrease
materially. So, that's what we're going to see. And then, the absolute expense base related to our businesses, I
think the way to think about it, and this is very similar sort of how we came out of the merger, is we should be sort
of top quartile efficiency ratio. So, the efficiency ratio is going to be a bit determined by a little bit of the market
conditions where rates are, but our business model, our construct, things that we're engaged in, I think rather than
sort of honing in on a specific number, because I think that sort of boxes you in, so to speak, in terms of business
mix and those type things, I think really hone in on the expectation from shareholders ought to be that we ought to
be sort of top quartile from an efficiency ratio, given the opportunities that we have, both on the revenue side and
then the diversity and construct of our business mix.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. And then, on the credit side, I appreciate the color you just gave around the
non-accruals. Can you give us your thoughts around additional reserve additions here? Is it likely that you still see
some incremental build there? And then, where does the commercial real estate reserve stand right now, the ratio
and the theme for the office commercial real estate reserve? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, John, this is Clarke. While we're comfortable with our reserve levels right now based on what we know
today, obviously, CECL's life-of-loan given what you know today, obviously, if the economic outlook deteriorates
any further or we do see additional deterioration beyond what we believe we've seen and forecasted today around
the portfolio performance or risk attributes, you could see some additional incremental build, but I would not
expect to see any sort of large build or hockey stick type. So, I think it would be more incremental if we see some.
And then, as far as – I did say the CRE office reserve is 6.2% overall and I would remind you all we have about
40% of our portfolio, our small loans and our wealth and CCB segments which carries higher reserves. So, we've
got I think really strong reserves against where I think the fundamental risk is in the office side. And then, our total
CRE allocation right now was [ph] 240 (00:56:50).

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Clarke, you were talking about what's going on here in commercial real estate, and can you give us some further
color on when you look at the nonaccrual increase in commercial real estate, is it because the owners of these
properties are losing tenants? Is it more the value of the properties have fallen and, therefore, the loan to values
are out of sync? And then as part of the answer, how are you guys working to resolve, working with your
customers to resolve these issues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great question, Gerard. I would say, for us, we take a very strict view of accrual status when we think about
whether loan needs to be on nonaccrual or not, and I would just remind you what I said, the majority of the loans
that we place on nonaccrual this quarter in the CRE office segment and C&I, but in the CRE office segment are
actually current from a contractual basis right now because they still have good economic rents, they're hedged
19

on the rate side, and so they're performing on their payments. But we're looking at what might happen at the end
of term as the rate impactfully hits after the slots go off and whether there's any risk in leasing activity and then
what it costs to, for example, reposition the property from an operating standpoint or structurally to be sure the
loan could be resized at maturity. And so that's what's driving our view of accrual status. So, a lot of it is the
valuation side unless the sponsor or principal can address these risks.
The good news is we're working with our sponsors. We don't see our clients in anyway just walking away from the
loans. We have long-term relationships there. And so we're looking at things like asking them to refit, bring in
more equity, give us an LC, bring us some interest reserves. We may do some A/B note splits and as they
attempt to sell the property. So, we've got a lot of tools in the tool chest and we're working all of those. Our goal is
to be early on this and work with as many borrowers as we can and, hopefully, the market will improve when we'll
have good success.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And then not to minimize the focus doesn't mean it's acute, but just also remember, 75% of this portfolio is sitting
in our markets. So, we're sort of a net in migration market. So while they're dealing with current tenants, people
are consolidating their office space, all that's happening, we're experiencing that with all of our bars. We also have
markets in which is a lot of in migration. So, there's also more new tenants and more opportunities and it's tedious
and chronic, you've got to be in the right building, the Class A, the opportunities, and our portfolio arch to Class A
and in markets, migration markets. So, again not to minimize it, but we got – we have some better opportunities
from that side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, Bill. Yeah, and just as a quick follow-up, Mike, when you look at the AOCI burn-down, what would
accelerate that in terms from an interest rate standpoint? The forward curve is looking for some short-term
interest rate cuts early next year. What would bring that number down even faster? From an interest rate
standpoint, what would you have to see?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, a couple, I think the positive catalyst even away from rates would be – I guess in connection with rates
would be speeds increasing in terms of the actual to the cash flow profile. But if you're looking at the rates, we
would need to see the long end rally and we'd actually need to see a parallel benefit from mortgage spreads as
well. So, some of the, for example, rate rally you saw even from the end of the quarter to this, to where we are 20,
30 basis points on the 10-year, if mortgage spreads don't come with it, it can lag a bit.
But that would be the – and, Gerard, thanks for the question because what we try to lay out on the right-hand part
of that slide, frankly, was a pretty conservative burn-down analysis based on today's speeds which are quite slow
and with no benefit from seeing yield curve normalization.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one more on cost here. I guess, how are you thinking about organizing the
effort in terms of who's kind of taking responsibility for running it? Are you think about bringing in any outside
consultants to get kind of a fresh perspective or talk about the organization a bit? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Matt, maybe at its simplest form, it's me in terms of sort of who is responsible. But our executive leadership team
and we've got a really good focus on those, we've got – and by the way, we have different third parties helping us
with different elements, sort of not an uber approach because I actually think we need to own it, it needs to be
part of the work that we do as a leadership team. But we have a variety of consultants looking on specific areas.
So, they may be focused on a consolidation of a specific technology or an outsourcing of a particular thing, so
they exist as part of the process. But this is an overall leadership team, sleeves rolled up, everybody is in it, not
only wind the business up but, most importantly, enterprise across where I think the real efficiencies are achieved
and are more permanent as we think about the company.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And in terms of how you think about the timing, is this going to be like a one-year effort, a several year effort, a
continuous improvement effort? How are you thinking about that so far? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, it's already underway and it's a continuous improvement. I mean, I think the mentality of structuring
the company around our strategic focus and creating a chassis that attaches to it is not a onetime thing. I think
that's something that we're constantly doing, constantly looking at, again back to that commitment to sort of be top
quartile in terms of how we run the company from an efficiency standpoint. So, that's both the revenue and the
expense part that comes along with that. So, it's not a onetime big bang thing because I actually don't think those
are permanent and don't think they stick. This is a philosophy of how we run the company and the approach that
we take long term.
