With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to all the participants on the call. This morning I will update you on Valley's
strong 2020 performance and discuss our longer-term strategic vision, including the important role that technology
will play in our future success. Mike will then provide additional details on the financial results before opening the
call to your questions.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported net income of $105 million and earnings per share of $0.25. Exclusive
of charges for debt extinguishment and severance, adjusted net income was $113 million. For the second
consecutive quarter, this represents the highest level of quarterly earnings in Valley's entire history. Our 2020
adjusted net income of $402 million was 23% higher than 2019 despite $100 million increase in our provision.
Despite a challenging backdrop, these exceptional financial results were achieved through the execution of our
strategic priorities as we became more efficient, diversified our revenue mix, and generated substantial core
deposit growth. I am optimistic that last year's macro challenges are beginning to abate and our strategic focus on
positive operating leverage and growth will position us for future success in 2021.
With regard to the macro environment, a more comprehensive vaccine rollout is on the horizon which will improve
the economic outlook and present new growth opportunities for us. With this backdrop, we expect to achieve mid-
single-digit loan growth in 2021, exclusive of the effects of PPP. The yield curve has also steepened meaningfully
in recent months, driving an increase in our loan origination yields. We continue to believe that we will outperform
many of our peers from a net interest margin perspective in 2021.
Despite ongoing economic pressure from the pandemic, our credit trends remained strong in 2020. Inclusive of
loans modified under the CARES Act, active deferrals were only 1.1% of loans at 12/31/2020 and non-accrual
loans were only 0.58% of total loans. Our net charge-offs were a mere 4 basis points of average loans in the
fourth quarter. Our underwriting discipline and credit strength support our below peer allowance for credit losses
which stands at 1.17% of loans excluding PPP. We are confident in our underwriting philosophy and the
performance of our borrowers and are well-positioned to manage the after effects of the pandemic from a credit
perspective.
This improving backdrop sets the stage for another strong year in 2021. I want to spend some time this morning
discussing how our relationship-based value proposition and technology strategy will help us drive improved
operating leverage and strong organic growth in 2021 and beyond.
As you know, COVID-19 has amplified the role of technology in the banking industry. Valley has been well ahead
of this trend, and our experience in 2020 reinforces the emphasis that we have placed on building best-in-class
technology solutions over the last few years.
While the industry has concentrated on front-end applications, we are hyper-focused on enhancing our back office
technology as well. This unique approach will ensure that we have the infrastructure and agility to support the
evolving needs of our customers and to execute on our growth initiatives.
Our success in PPP is a great example of why our differentiated strategy is so important. In the early days of the
program, we quickly stood up an internally developed end-to-end digital process built on our own technology
infrastructure. Our ability to execute and originate $2.3 billion of PPP loans was a direct result of our technology

strategy and the agile infrastructure we are building. PPP also highlighted how we use technology to support, not
replace the human element of banking. Each PPP borrower was supported by a Valley banker throughout this
process.
Valley has always been a relationship-focused banking institution. Our customers value thoughtful advice from
our knowledgeable bankers, our differentiated high-touch service, and the comprehensive suite of financial
solutions that we provide. This customer-focused value proposition, supported by technology, will help us attract
new clients and drive growth going forward.
Our customers aren't the only ones that recognize the momentum that we have built. Over the last few years, we
have reinvigorated and diversified our team, and we are now a desired destination for top bankers across the
industry. People want to join our organization, and we continue to bolster the team that will execute the next
phase of our evolution. This evolution will be supported by a sustainable technology infrastructure enabling
improved operating leverage and organic growth. We continue to use technology to drive process improvement
and support our relationship bankers as they service the diverse financial needs of our customers.
We are building a high-performing agile organization with a strong corporate culture. This will allow our
organization to continue to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and will drive future success for all of our
stakeholders. I couldn't be more proud of what our team has accomplished to-date and couldn't be more excited
for what the future holds for Valley.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some additional financial highlights.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 5, you can see that Valley's reported net interest margin increased to 3.06% from
3.01% in the third quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities improved by 11
basis points to 0.69%. Total interest expense declined by approximately 15% from the prior quarter and is down
56% from the fourth quarter of 2019. This reflects continued reductions in interest-bearing deposit cost and the
significant non-maturity deposit growth that we have experienced in recent quarters.
Earning asset yields declined 4 basis points as higher-yielding loans continue to repay. This repayment was
partially offset by higher prepayment fees and PPP forgiveness income compared to the third quarter. Our cash
balance continued to increase in the quarter as a result of strong deposit inflows. We estimate that additional cash
weighed on our asset yield by 2 basis points as compared to the third quarter.
In mid-December we deployed excess liquidity to repay $534 million of higher cost FHLB advances. These
borrowings carried an average cost of 2.48%, and the majority were set to mature in the third quarter of 2021. All
else equal, we estimate this action would add 7 basis points to our future net interest margin.
You can see more detail regarding the impacts of PPP income on slide 6. We estimate that PPP income
contributed 1 basis point to the margin during the quarter. The sequential increase in PPP revenue is due to the
accelerated forgiveness of approximately $125 million of PPP loans during the quarter. Today we have
recognized PPP fees of $28 million. An additional $45 million of fees related to Phase 1 and 2 originations will be
recognized as remaining loans are forgiven or repaid. As you are aware, the SBA recently rolled out Phase 3 of
PPP. We are now encouraged again with origination volumes that our colleagues are processing in support of our
local businesses.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Slide 7 outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to reprice liabilities lower in 2021. Over
the next three quarters, we have over $4 billion of retail CDs maturing at an average cost above 80 basis points.
Currently, our highest CD offering rate is 35 basis points for five years. There are additional opportunities to
reprice borrowings and brokered CDs lower as well.
To this point, we've been able to protect our net interest margin through funding cost reductions. As a result of our
repricing and liquidity deployment levers, we continue to believe that we will outperform peers from a net interest
margin perspective going forward.
Slide 8 illustrates the significant improvement in our funding profile that we achieved in 2020. Total deposits
increased more than 9%, driven by a 37% increase in non-interest-bearing deposits and a 25% increase in
interest-bearing transaction accounts. CD balances declined 31% in the year. This transformation is the result of
both value-specific efforts, particularly with regards to cross-selling new PPP customers, and an industry-wide
liquidity increase. We will work hard to preserve this mix shift going forward.
The bottom left chart illustrates the significant downward trend in our interest-bearing deposit costs over the last
few quarters. In the fourth quarter, our average cost of deposits was a mere 33 basis points. This is Valley's
lowest quarterly deposit cost in at least the last 30 years. Given this already low starting point, deposit cost
reductions beyond the CD repricing opportunity identified earlier are likely to be more incremental going forward.
One side effect of our recent deposit growth is continually elevated levels of liquidity. Our cash balance increased
to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion in the third quarter. This occurred despite our utilization of nearly $550 million of
excess liquidity to prepay FHLB advances as mentioned earlier. As we strive to optimize our liquidity and our
earnings, we will continue to evaluate additional deployment opportunities on both sides of the balance sheet.
Slide 9 details our loan portfolio and origination trends over the last few quarters. Despite higher loan fees and the
previously mentioned PPP forgiveness, average loan yields declined 3 basis points in the quarter. On the positive
side, our average origination rate increased 9 basis points from the third quarter. The steeper curve has also
expanded loan spreads, which reached their widest levels since the first quarter of 2019.
Excluding PPP, total loans declined slightly during the quarter. We generated $1.4 billion of new loans in the
quarter, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and on par with pre-pandemic levels. On the commercial side,
strong originations were offset by the repayment of two large loans, totaling approximately $150 million where the
borrowers' businesses were sold. We also saw stability in our consumer portfolios, which increased for the first
time in four quarters.
Our pipelines remain robust and organic growth opportunities have returned to pre-pandemic levels. While activity
has rebounded across our markets, we are particularly excited by opportunities in Florida where we are
dedicating additional resources to meet the increased demand.
Slide 10 illustrates the improvement in our loan deferral since the onset of the pandemic. At the end of the fourth
quarter, total deferrals had declined to $361 million or just over 1% of our loan portfolio. Loan deferrals in our
COVID-exposed portfolios stand at 2.3%, down from 7.1% in the third quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our
commercial deferrals remain current with regards to interest payments.
Moving to slide 11, our non-interest income declined 5% from the third quarter. Swap fees declined 43% to $11
million while deposit service charges and gain on sale income both improved. Net residential mortgage gain on
sale income increased approximately 19% sequentially, reflecting gain on sale margin expansion. Residential

loans sold were effectively in line with the third quarter at $295 million while the gain on sale margin increased
over 50 basis points to 4.35%.
For the year, adjusted non-interest income increased over 30% and comprised 14% of our revenue. We
recognize that certain fee lines will ebb and flow with market conditions. However, we remain focused on growing
diverse revenue streams and building differentiated businesses that our customers will value. To that end, we
recently announced the hiring of a municipal investment strategy team to further diversify our capital markets and
correspondent banking businesses.
Slide 12 illustrates our expense trends throughout the year. Our fourth quarter results included nearly $12 million
of pre-tax debt extinguishment and severance charges. These charges reflect efforts to improve our positioning
for 2021. Adjusted expenses increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, partially related to a $1.4 million asset
impairment charge and elevated telecom expenses. We expect both of these items to normalize going forward.
For the year, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 47.4%, down from 53.8% in 2019 and well below our 51% target.
On a year-over-year basis, we generated 26% revenue growth against an 11% increase in adjusted operating
expenses. Looking forward, we acknowledge that industry-wide revenue headwinds are likely to build.
On the expense side, easily identified excess costs have been largely rationalized. We have a modest tailwind
from the branch closures that we mentioned last quarter and which occurred in December. Our team is hard at
work identifying additional process improvements that can help us preserve the strong operating leverage
momentum that we have established.
Turning to slide 13, you can see our credit trends in the last five quarters. Notably, on the top right, non-accruals
declined to 0.58% of loans from 0.59% in the third quarter. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by
the C&I portfolio.
Net charge-offs declined to $3 million, representing the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. This equated
to just 4 basis points of loans versus 19 basis points in the prior quarter. Despite the extremely low level of
charge-offs, our allowance for credit losses increased to 1.09% of loans from 1.03%. We remain optimistic on our
outlook for credit performance.
The quarter's reserve build is related to a few specific factors. First, we revised our New York City taxi medallion
valuation to $82,000 from $109,000, which contributed to our specific reserve. We also downgraded certain
commercial credits in COVID-exposed industries, including hospitality, retail, and dining. We've been very
selective lending to these industries and have focused on established borrowers with substantial liquidity and
diverse sources of cash flow.
While the properties in these specific industries warranted downgrades, we remain confident in the overall
performance of these borrowers. Valley's credit strength has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our
organization. Our loss rates have historically lagged peers, which has enabled us to carry a below average
reserve. While continued economic uncertainty contributed to our modest reserve build this quarter, we still
expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in any economic environment.
Slide 14 illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the ongoing improvement in our capital
ratios. Tangible book value has increased 8% in the last 12 months, driven by our increased earnings power. Our
tangible common equity ratio increased to 7.47% from 7.32% in the third quarter.

We estimate that our $2.2 billion of PPP loans reduced our TCE to total asset ratio by approximately 43 basis
points in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory
capital ratios. We remain comfortable with our capital levels and believe that the consistent growth in our risk-
based ratios illustrate our improving ability to increase our capital levels on an organic basis.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some closing commentary.

and look forward to executing on our strategic priorities and driving continued success.

Just on – first question was on [ph] a loan. (20:24) You talked about the loan pipelines having rebuilt to pre-
COVID levels and the mid-single-digit growth. And, Mike, you also mentioned Florida as the greater opportunity
within that. Just wondering if you can speak to – a little more color on is it sort of Florida could be a high single-
digit growth and up north could be low single digits? And then any expected change in mix in terms of loan type?

Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp

the third quarter to the fourth quarter as Mike pointed out, returning us to the pre-pandemic levels. Florida

represents 40% of our production today, up from probably 30% a year ago and we also experienced slightly better
margins in the Florida market.
Our business in New York, New Jersey remained steady. The pipelines continue to grow across the regions and
across all different types of loans that we're involved in between C&I and CRE. Our business is primarily in the
suburban markets, not a big reliance on the Manhattan market. But following our success and our growth in
Florida, we've begun adding C&I teams and we're looking to increase the C&I staff in Florida by 25%, and we've
already begun adding those people.
Florida today represents about 28% of our commercial portfolio. We expect that to grow. We expect C&I to
complement our already strong real estate business, but we expect growth in New York, New Jersey to continue
on the same pace it has in the past.
Also, we'll be adding a team of experienced C&I lenders in the Philadelphia market at some point during this year.
We're actively recruiting. Two years ago, we moved into Philly with real estate lenders. We've had great success.
It complements what we do up here. The attributes of the market are very similar to the New Jersey market, and
it's contiguous and much easier for us to manage.
So, we do expect that single-digit growth to occur this year. Florida will be an important component as it always
has been, but we get steady growth in all our markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And [ph] now (22:35) if I could just sneak in one more on fee income initiatives and just thinking about the
next couple of years, I guess, I mean non-interest income to revenues, I guess could that ratio – just given the
strong year in 2020, could that ratio growing be more of sort of a 2022 or 2023 result? Just wondering if you could
talk a little bit about that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. This is Mike. Keep in mind that fee income as a percent of total revenue is taking a little bit of a hit because
we've had such great success with net interest income. And so it's probably stronger than it looks on a percent of
revenue basis just because of that. But our commitment to either starting new businesses, adding to what we
already do in the fee income space, which shouldn't get lost in the equation, that's definitely part of what we're
doing.
One of our strategic priorities over the coming years is to increase that percentage that fees represent of total
revenue. And I think the comment that I made regarding the municipal business we started in the fourth quarter
shows and demonstrates our commitment to do that.

Good morning, Steve.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start first on the efficiency ratio, so you're well below the 51% target for 2020. Now that you're well
below that, what's the target for 2021 and moving forward more general?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
We really haven't given a specific target as to where we think we're going to move the organization. I think you've
seen significant positive operating leverage. We think there's still leverage that we can pull, Steve, based on
improvements and how we outline technology throughout the entire organization. We continue down the path of
looking at efficiencies across the entire branch platform and we think there's a lot of opportunities within the
organization.
Getting to a stronger efficiency ratio, we think, is going to be important as we continue to lever and grow the
organization. As Mike mentioned, there is definite headwinds coming within the interest rate environment and we
think we have a good opportunity to really mitigate some of those headwinds based on what we do on the
efficiency side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And without giving a number, as we look forward, one of the things we enjoy today is our efficiency ratio is a
differentiator for us vis-à-vis our peers. That is something that we expect to be – continue to produce and we
believe that that's actually really important to our future strategic success as you look at what's going on in the
industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, if we look at another way, so if we look at the pre-tax, pre-provision ROA which you called it on slide 3,
we'd have to back out the PPP program impact. So, let's say we do that, which I think we could do with the
numbers you gave us, so apples to apples, how should we think about that trending through 2020 given the
headwinds you're talking about, Ira?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think we looked at – that obviously, there's some headwinds when you think about the PPP income
coming off as you identified. We think that's still going to be strong for the first half of 2021. I think mortgage
volume could potentially go down as well based on where we see interest rate environment.

But we have a lot, a lot going on within the organization when we think about the organic growth. As Tom
mentioned, we're expanding our lending staff 25% in the Florida footprint. We are going down to Philadelphia as
well with a more concerted effort and we think that we can manage the expense base to not really see significant
increase as a result of these strategic initiatives.
So, we think there's a lot of opportunity within the organization to really drive revenue growth throughout the entire
footprint and we think that will have a positive impact as to how we think about the efficiency ratio as we move
forward, largely a function of what we're doing on the revenue side. And we think we have the capacity based on
the operating leverage and not really have to increase expenses.

... [indiscernible] (26:45) that real quickly. If you just look at the lending side, I would direct your attention to slide
9. One of the things we're most – or encouraged by is the fact that our total loan book only went down 3 basis
points and our net originations for the quarter were up 9 basis points. I'm not saying that's necessarily the ongoing
run rate, but it's definitely encouraging and we're not seeing remarkable reductions in loans, at least on the
portfolio as it sits right now. And as I said, the new originations are higher.
When you flip to the liability side of the balance sheet, one of the things that's going to help us on PPP is going to
be the continued improvement, that we have an opportunity to reprice our liability sources considerably lower,
with $4 billion in the next roughly three quarters at over 80 bps. I would expect that those would all come on at
least less than half of where they're coming off right now when they mature.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay. That's helpful. So, for my final question, I wanted to ask you a big picture question. So you guys had
announced a fairly bold initiative and intended transformation of the franchise as part of LIFT but it was really
when you took over the CEO role. Can you give us a sense where is the company now, right, the new Valley? Are
you where you need to be from a client satisfaction view? Are you still working to change the culture? Are you still
heavily investing in the franchise? Where are we in this transformation? Thanks.

Thank you and I think we made significant progress, I think, from where we were to where we're headed. The
investment in technology has been significant and you've seen that investment in technology without bringing up
the overall expenses within the organization. So, I think we've done a really good job of managing that
investment. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity still left when we think about what that technology
investment has and what the positive operating leverage is.
The culture within the organization is something I've never seen before in my 25 years here and I think is enviable
to many outsiders. We are a destination, without question, for bankers looking to come to an organization that has
consistency, that has empowerment, and that really drives agility as to how we think about moving forward.
Technology is going to continue to change and banking's going to continue to change. I think three years ago, we
started to talk about technology and everyone looked at technology and said, okay, we need a new front end or
we need a new way to interact with our customers. And we sat there and said, wait, technology is all about the
infrastructure and the agility. And we started to invest in the infrastructure, not an individual core, not a front end
technology when it comes to a treasury or what type of infrastructure we had to enable to have plug and play
technology that enabled us to really be relevant as the environment changes.
And then we think about just even what you think about from a physical transformation today. And everyone is
looking at COVID and saying, wow, we need to now begin to rethink what our workspace looks like. 2.5 years
ago, we sold our corporate office buildings here and we began to think about at that point that the physical
environment was going to change.
Over the last five years, we've closed over 50 branches with an understanding that delivery channels were
changing. We didn't need COVID to begin to tell us that the environment was changing and that the customer
behavior was changing. This is our vision. This was our understanding of what was happening within the
environment and it's going to continue to change. And we think we're building an agile workforce that will be first
to adapt to many of these changes and deliver outsized performance.
I mean I remember three years ago when we sat there and laid out these efficiency targets, no one thought that
we would get them, right? And we will surpass them, and I think the Street will be pleased, I think, with where
we're headed and we continue to deliver outsized performance.

Hey. Good morning. Just following up on the expense discussion, clearly there's been a lot of work done and the
technology, at least from what I've seen paying dividends. But philosophically speaking, should we expect
expenses from here to mostly stabilize? We see revenues without added cost. Is that at least philosophically the
way to think about it or is there actual room to bring down the absolute level of expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I think as we said in our or as I said in my prepared remarks I think the low-hanging fruit part of it is done. We're
never done in our ability to get more efficient or bring down expenses, so we will always be trying to find places to
do that. However, we do have to admit that as we've said, we're going to be growing the business, we're going to
be adding new teams of bankers. And so to the extent that they produced the revenue that offsets it and
continues to show the positive operating leverage that we have historically shown, in this quarter we showed 2.5x
operating leverage, we got to keep our eyes on both sides of it. But I don't think we're done necessarily on the
expense side.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then the other one for me is I couldn't help but ask, in your 10-Q you mentioned implementing a new
deposit service for businesses in the cannabis industry. Can you better frame for us that business? What's on the
balance sheet array, the overall market as it currently stands, and the opportunity, whether it's deposits, loans,
fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I'll let Tom address it in a couple of seconds, but I think this is happening, and we're burying our heads in the sand
if we think that this isn't going to really impact us. From my perspective, it's better to come in with an approach as
to how we want to handle it and be well bought out as opposed to letting the market dictate what that strategy is.
We've had an ability over the last year to really define who we wanted to partner with from an infrastructure
perspective to make sure we had the right checks and balances in place, to make sure we had the right AML
processes in place. And we could pick the partner that we wanted to really deal with as we begin to grow this.
When this becomes legal and more widespread throughout the entire banking industry, I think people are going to
take shortcuts in how they look at garnering this type of business. And in my mind, it's much better to be proactive
in addressing something than being reactive, and I think that was our approach here. It's not sizable at this point.
We've picked a couple reputable partners as to how we want to grow. And we think it'll continue to pay some
dividends, but it's not moving the needle on anything at this point.
Tom, is there something you wanted to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay.

Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, it's a deposit-focused opportunity for us. We're going to onboard slowly within the state to do business
where it's legalized. We have one multi-state company that we've begun onboarding in both New Jersey and

Florida. We'll continue to add other entities as we kind of get a little more comfortable, and we'll go a slow pace in
making sure we're doing all the right AML/BSA work and we're verifying as we go along. But as Ira said, it's not
going to move the needle this year but ultimately it could be impactful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
And I think, Matt, just one thing I would add, I think my mind reflects where the organization is headed. I think too
many organizations look to COVID, look to this environment, look to that environment and say, well, we need to
not react. We have a very strong understanding and very strong belief as to where the industry is headed, not just
COVID but banking in general. And we better be damn well proactive in how we address that and make sure that
we have the right infrastructure and agility on our own without somebody telling us that we need to put this in
place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Last one for me. Ira, clearly there's a lot of energy from you and the rest of the management team on
what you can do internally. Is M&A a priority here or do you think you have enough internally to get where you
need to be without it? Can you prioritize where M&A stands for us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Look, we have amazing strategic initiatives within this organization. We've hired the most amazing tremendous
people as well, and I couldn't be more excited about where we're headed. There's new businesses that we're
beginning to get into from an organic perspective, but there's a clear understanding that we need to continue to
diversify the revenue stream, look at opportunities as to how we create consistent growth from a deposit and loan
perspective of that maybe and looking at different expanded strategies and geographies as Tom was talking
about earlier. And we need to make sure that we're looking out to have a positive operating leverage. So if there's
opportunities [ph] from M&A (35:20) perspective that makes sense, that don't distract us, that don't reallocate a
tremendous amount of resources, it's something we would definitely entertain. That said, if it doesn't happen,
we're absolutely comfortable.
I think the most important thing is we have a clear understanding of who we are, where we're headed, and what
we want to be. We also have a clear understanding that there are things that could potentially accelerate that.
And if it makes sense from an allocation of resources perspective, then we owe it to our shareholders to go down
the path of looking at it from a diligence perspective. That said, it has to align with our strategic initiatives. And if it
doesn't, it's not something we're going to focus on.

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will be from the line of Chris O'Connell from KBW. You may begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So I just want to start off with that you guys mentioned the strength in the Florida franchise and allocating some
additional strategic resources towards those efforts. If you could just kind of like expand upon the efforts that
you're having there, and I'm assuming it's primarily on the residential mortgage side as well as the deposit
gathering side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
No. No. It's primarily on the C&I side. As you know, our real estate business in Florida is very strong. We have an
active C&I business. We'll be expanding C&I lenders in all of our major markets going Miami, all the way up to
Orlando, Jacksonville, and over across to Tampa, down to Naples. So it's that C&I emphasis in Florida. And I also
want to say we're doing similar in New York; we just don't need as many in New York. We have a vibrant C&I
business up here in New York and New Jersey, and we'll be expanding that to complement that already strong
real estate business. So it's a C&I focus and we'll fill in real estate lenders here and there in the markets who
need them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Chris, Florida is a massively growing, growing market obviously as you see the demographic shift. We obviously
have a very strong residential mortgage program throughout our entire footprint. If you look at the footprint, we
averaged about 50/50 this quarter in what was refinanced, well, what was home purchased. If you look up in the
New Jersey market [indiscernible] (37:40) about 35% of that was refinanced. It's the exact opposite in Florida.
Most of the originations are based on home purchases. There is a growing economy down in Florida. A lot of the
loan growth that we see up here is definitely from a focus of us from a relationship perspective, but also taking
business from other banks. There's real organic growth that's happening in Florida, and we think there's a real
opportunity to continue to differentiate ourselves and put some additional growth on by allocating the resources
down there.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
And just to expand of what Ira said on the consumer side, the Florida purchase market is 60% and refinance is
40%. And as Ira pointed out, it's the flip side when you get up here in New York, New Jersey. And more
importantly, in a very short period of time, a couple years, we've built a consumer business between Florida-
Alabama to almost $1.2 billion. So when you look at the Florida contribution, it's not just the commercial, 28% of
the portfolio, it's also a growing consumer business. And again, it's a lot of conforming, it's a lot of prime and
super prime, and direct auto business that's coming out of there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's great color. Thanks. And as you're kind of thinking longer term or from a broader strategic
perspective at Florida, obviously you guys have gone down there in the past with acquisitions but it's been a
while. Would you consider M&A down in that area as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think we would definitely consider M&A in that marketplace, but let me be clear, this is sort of what our
constraints are, right? So the constraint certainly revolves around what our strategic initiatives are, and it's not
going to be complementary to one of those strategic initiatives. It's something we don't want to deal and we don't
want to allocate resources.
But let me also talk about tangible book value, right, and it's something that I've been pretty attuned to as to how
we think about growth and what the franchise value is. And we are absolutely not going to further dilute our
shareholders to a significant degree just to continue to grow down in that Florida marketplace. We think we have
a good foothold and there's organic growth that we can do down there.
If it's tangible book value dilutive, it has to make sense. It has to be very, very short from an earn back perspective
and something we think that we can really, really leverage. And if it doesn't make sense from a tangible book
value perspective, then we're not doing it. We diluted our shareholders a significant amount back in 2014 in some
of the other deals that we did. We are not doing that again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. And then just a couple of cleanup items. For the mortgage banking, I mean, 2020
obviously, particularly strong year, I mean, how do you see that demand coming into the game line going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. The demand in production this year was very strong for us, probably up 30% from 2019. The refinance
market has held up so far this quarter. We don't expect it to hold up for the full year at the same pace. The
purchase market is strong, the migration into the suburbs, and the purchase market is doing well also. So it's
really hard to say. I mean, we are focused on conforming business so I don't expect growth in the portfolio, but I
do expect that we'll continue to manage and take advantage of the refinance market while it's here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher O'Connell Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's all I had. Thank you.
