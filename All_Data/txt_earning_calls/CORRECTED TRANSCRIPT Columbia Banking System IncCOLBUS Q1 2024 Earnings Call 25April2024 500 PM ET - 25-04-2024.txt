Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to the Columbia Banking System's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to introduce Clint Stein, President and CEO of Columbia, to begin the conference call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Didi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results. The
earnings release and corresponding presentation are available on our website at columbiabankingsystem.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties and are
intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. For a list of factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to the disclosures contained within our SEC
filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures and encourage you to review the non-GAAP
reconciliations provided in our earnings materials.
With that, March 1st marked the one year anniversary of the closing of our merger. It was a notable milestone for
our company for many reasons. Importantly, provided us with a full year of data points for what was working well
within the combined organization and allowed us to identify redundancies and inefficiencies that are a natural
byproduct of large mergers. Our one-year anniversary marks the conclusion of our merger integration phase and
enabled us to start our operational effectiveness work. Armed with the observations and learnings over the first
year, we made significant progress on identifying opportunities for improving our expense profile.
During the first quarter, we reduced our head count by 91 FTE with additional reductions communicated internally
of 142 for the month of April. The FTE reductions, combined with other expense savings enacted in the first
quarter, represent annualized reductions of $18 million. These savings are reflected as of quarter end, not in the
first quarter's normalized operating run rate of $286 million. The actions taken to-date for the second quarter add
an additional $25 million of savings annualized to the first quarter number. You've heard me say many times over
the years that we target a top quartile level of performance across all financial metrics and a lower cost structure
moves us toward our goal and away from what has been up to this point, average at best.
The meaningful reductions to our associate base were done in a thoughtful manner, eliminated positions and
retirements, spanned all departments and levels of management, including the executive team, which is now 15%
smaller. Over the past year, our leaders gained an in-depth knowledge of their teams, processes and other
factors, allowing them to identify areas for operational improvement as full scale review resulted in consolidated
positions, simplified reporting and organizational structures and an improved profitability outlook.
We believe these changes will enable us to operate more efficiently while preserving the premier levels of service
we provide to our customers. Associated cost savings will continue to be realized during the second and third
quarters, with the full benefit of our actions reflected in the fourth quarter expense run rate we outlined in our
March update. We expect to incur roughly $13 million in related restructuring expense in the second quarter,
which will be fully mitigated by the associated expense reductions within the current year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Our organizational review resulted in a swift elimination of redundancies, but our work is not complete. Our
process identified many longer term initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and further drive franchise value.
As many of you know, Columbia has always operated in a cost conscious manner, and we will continue to seek
out additional opportunities to optimize our performance from a revenue, expense and profitability standpoint.
I hope our actions year-to-date demonstrate that we are laser focused on regaining our placement as a top
quartile bank as we drive towards long-term, consistent and repeatable performance. Upon completion of this
initiative, our ability to reinvest in our people, our franchise and our suite of products and services will remain
intact. We believe these investments, along with a lower expense base, will continue to drive additional long-term
shareholder value.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. We reported first quarter EPS of $0.59 and operating EPS of $0.65 per share. And our
operating return on average tangible equity was 16% while the operating PPNR was $201 million. Please refer to
non-GAAP reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to our
calculation of operating metrics. On the balance sheet, we had $200 million of loan growth and $100 million of
deposit growth. For deposits, we had a decline in non-interest bearing demand that occurred in January, but we're
encouraged to see those balances flat for both February and March. Our net interest margin of 3.52% was within
our estimated range of 3.45% to 3.60%, and the expected reduction from the prior quarter was driven primarily by
the deposit shifts that occurred in Q4 and January.
Our NIM increased to 3.55% in the month of March, due to pricing reductions on wholesale and promotional
funding. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits was 2.88% for the quarter. Within the quarter, this cost was 2.90%
for both February and March, but ticked down to 2.89% at the very end of March. Our projected interest rate
sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position, and we expect our rate
stay on deposit betas to approximate those experienced on the way up.
Now, provision for credit loss was $17 million for the quarter. We updated our commercial CECL model this
quarter to better reflect historical and expected future losses. In 2023, the methodology for our combined
company was structured to the historical Umpqua portfolio composition. The outcome was increased volatility in
our provision expense that wasn't characteristic of the granularity and quality of our combined commercial
portfolio. Our recalibrated commercial models, which now integrate additional data and operating knowledge,
have effectively reduced our commercial allowance for credit losses. It's important to note that the increase in our
CRE and multifamily ACL is a response to the transient market conditions in western downtown cores, where we
maintain a minimal presence in our portfolio.
Despite these adjustments, our overall allowance for credit loss remains robust, closing the quarter at 1.16% of
total loans, or 1.36% when including the remaining credit discount. Total GAAP expenses for the quarter were
$288 million, while operating expenses were $277 million. We've reflected the FDIC special assessment as non-
operating item in the press release. Of note, we had a number of one-off items in the quarter that benefited our
expense level. Absent these, I peg our normalized level of operating expense at $286 million. As a reminder on
the expense front, we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately $13 million related to the efficiency
initiative that Clint discussed as non-operating expense in Q2.

Now [indiscernible] (00:08:33) to our regulatory capital position. Our risk-based capital ratios increased as
expected in Q1. We expect to build capital above our long-term targets, which will provide for enhanced future
flexibility. I'll close with our outlook for 2024 on several key financial statement items. These are consistent with
those included in our early March investor presentation. Average earning assets are expected to remain in the
$48 billion to $49 billion range. Our NIM is expected to remain in the 3.45% to 3.60% range, which includes
stability in deposit balances. For discount accretion, we continue to expect $130 million to $140 million of
securities rate related accretion, $90 million to $100 million of loan rate related accretion, and $15 million to $20
million of loan credit related accretion. We expect full year operating expense, including CDI amortization in the
$975 million to $1.025 billion range.
With the cost savings that Clint discussed earlier, we expect our Q4 operating expense, excluding CDI
amortization, to be in the $965 million to $985 million range on an annualized basis. We expect CDI amortization
of $120 million for the year, about $29 million in each of the remaining quarters of 2024, merger-related expense
of $10 million to $15 million, and our effective income tax rate at 26.5%.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.

Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron. The loan portfolio credit performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our through-the-
cycle underwriting process and discipline together with the quality of our borrowers and sponsors. The trends
we're observing in delinquency and non-performing loans are consistent with the shift towards a more standard
credit environment, which follows an extended period of outstanding credit quality. The $30 million increase in
non-performing assets this quarter, primarily attributed to our SBA portfolio and a single C&I-related property, is
within expected parameters and reflects the dynamic nature of the credit landscape. After accounting for the
government guaranteed portion, the rise in non-performing loans remains modest.
Our vigilant and ongoing monitoring of the portfolio is augmented by focused reviews of specific asset classes
such as our multifamily and our office portfolios. These detailed analyses have consistently shown no systemic
issues across different industries, sectors or regions. We have no delinquent loans in our multifamily portfolio and
our office portfolio delinquencies remained extremely low at less than 50 basis points of the total office portfolio.
Neither portfolio has had any charge off activity. Net charge offs for the consolidated company were 47 basis
points annualized for the quarter, with 22 basis points attributable to the bank and 25 basis points to FinPac. We
remain very satisfied with the quality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio, which is highlighted in greater
detail in our investor presentation.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank. For obvious reasons, deposit remains a key focal area for our teams this quarter. We adjusted
how we evaluate and approve deposit pricing during the first quarter, a comprehensive review of exceptions and
other pricing authorities resulted in tighter controls and a renewed discipline around deposit pricing. These
changes directly contributed to the stability of our interest-bearing core deposit rates late into the quarter. We also
reduced our promotional rates on money market and CD accounts, and the CD repricing impact in the first quarter
was significantly lower than it was in the fourth quarter. Beyond our actions related to deposit pricing, the teams
are also focused on bringing new relationships to the bank. Our branches are wrapping up a three-month small

business campaign launched in early February, which contributed $225 million in deposit generation to our first
quarter results and an additional $75 million to-date in the second quarter.
The campaign includes bundled solutions for customers without promotional pricing or special products.
Additionally, 25% of the balances are non-interest bearing. Total cost of funds for these deposits was 1.95%, and
in addition, we have seen an increase in our commercial card and merchant card activity from the increased
referrals. These actions all contributed to a significantly slower pace of increase in our cost of interest-bearing
deposits, which was 2.89% as of March 31, compared to 2.75% as of December 31 and 2.27% as of September
30. So the first quarter's increase was a less impactful 14 basis points compared to the 48 basis point increase
during the fourth quarter. While these recent pricing and balance trends are encouraging, we expect continued
declines in non-interest bearing deposit balances during the second quarter due to seasonal pressures that
include customer tax payments.
Non-interest bearing balances were down 3% on an end-of-period basis in the first quarter, but they were down
7% on an average basis due to seasonal declines late in the fourth quarter. The higher rate environment and
inflationary pressures have contributed to non-interest bearing balance migration over the past two years. With
the Fed funds rate seemingly stabilized and given our proactive pricing discussions, we expect deposit pricing
pressure to remain moderated when compared to 2023. But persistent inflation continues to draw down
customers account balances, which may exacerbate the tough seasonal deposit flows we typically experience in
the second quarter. That said, our teams are focused on generating new business to offset these headwinds, and
their success will be key to containing our deposit costs regardless of where we see any rate cuts from the Fed
this year.
Turning to the loan portfolio, relationship driven growth remains our primary focus. Loan balances increased 2%
on an annualized basis during the quarter. Commercial lines of credit and owner occupied commercial real estate
drove half of the quarter's expansion and were the primary drivers of the new originations. Lastly on the loan
book, I'll note that our customers had a number of projects in process which resulted in construction draw downs
and the transition from construction financing to permanent financing during the quarter. This activity accounted
for the remaining portfolio growth. Our bankers remain focused on the activities that drive balance growth and
customer deposits, core fee income and relationship-based loans.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Clint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. We're committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive long-term shareholder value. In
line with our expectations, our total capital ratio has increased more than 100 basis points over the past year
since we closed our merger with Umpqua. At 12% for the parent company, we are now at our long-term target.
The bank remains modestly below at 11.7%. So we're on the cusp of all regulatory ratios exceeding our long-term
targets. However, our TCE ratio was 6.6% at quarter end, and we would like to see that ratio grow closer to 8%
before considering meaningful options for deploying excess capital. We still expect to organically generate capital
well above what is required to support prudent growth and our regular dividend, providing us longer-term flexibility
for additional returns to shareholders.
This concludes our prepared comments. Tory, Chris, Ron, Frank and I are happy to take your questions now.
Didi, please open the call for Q&A.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Feaster of Raymond
James. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
You guys have been extremely busy since announcing the cost saving initiatives. You know, the cost saves have
come through a lot earlier than I think we had expected. I was hoping maybe you could help us think through
some of the initiatives that are in place and where you're reinvesting some of those savings. You talked about
opening a few de novo branches. I know you're always looking for new talent and have had several
announcements. And then just kind of how you think about that expense line trend over the course of the year?
Would you expect to be fairly steady improvement or more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter to get to
kind of those targets? I mean, you're already at the top end of the range right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, David, as we've come to expect from you, you pack a lot into question and there are several of us here at
the table that can provide insight. So, I'll kick it off. And then you'll probably hear from Tory, Chris and Ron as
well. I'll start with in my prepared comments. We had a year of running the company. We set the original
organizational design in place in January of 2022. So, almost 14 months before we could actually start operating
the company on a combined basis. And what we didn't want to do at that point in time was cut too deeply, do
things – make cuts that would have a direct impact on customer facing areas of the company.
And we also kept some redundancy in place because, as you know, when you go through any type of merger, let
alone one of this size and where we blended the teams, some people self-select out. And so we just felt like it
was prudent to take the first year, continually evaluate what was working well, more importantly, what we could do
better and then make an assessment as to – if it's in the leadership role, which leaders are going to be able to
help push us forward to the level and degree that we expect.
And then if we have processes that didn't work and that I kind of alluded to that in my prepared remarks, there's
the opportunity, I think, longer term to reengineer some processes, enhance and improve some automation.
That's going to be to a much lesser degree, just kind of a continuous improvement, get better every day type of
mentality like what you've expected from Columbia over the years. The real what I'll call right sizing the expense
base work, some of it was done in the first quarter before we even started talking about it. Some of the – we did
some branch consolidations. We had some miscellaneous contracts that we're able to renegotiate at the maturity.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
And then we had the FTE initiative, which came towards the end. And then really the big number I mentioned $25
million of annualized savings that have been announced just this month and that work started the first of the
month and associates were notified and then we started that process. So I would say that it's going to trickle
through the third quarter, but the bulk of the effort will happen and be concluded in the second quarter. But by
time you get a full clean run rate of the entire scope of this initiative, it will be the fourth quarter. So that's why we
put that number out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And Dave, this is Ron. Just one thing, because you mentioned we've already achieved it today. I would just
reiterate that as we look back at Q1, we did have some one-off credits in the operating expense number that
ended – it turned $77 million. We pegged a normalized number at $286 million. When you think about go-forward
quarters as part of the [ph] saves kicking in, in the middle (00:22:34) and then expected range of $965 million to
$985 million of Q4 2024 operating expense, excluding CDI amortization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Just sitting here today with what the numbers I threw out, its $43 million annualized. That's done. So if that
helps you as you're kind of thinking about how to tune your model going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Perfect. That's helpful. And then maybe just as we think about the margin, I think Chris alluded to it. I mean,
obviously, one of the primary keys to the margin is going to be the core deposit trends. So, I guess, I'm curious
maybe you're thoughts on core deposits and some of the initiatives you've got in place. It sounds like there were
some really encouraging trends from that targeted deposit campaign $300 million of core deposit growth. I'm
curious, what else are you working on and maybe some other campaigns or initiatives that you're considering to
help support core deposit growth, especially on the NIB front?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, David. I can't – this is Chris. Yeah. I won't give you our complete playbook, but I can give you some color. I
can give you some color to it. And the retail campaign, it shows what can be done with a little over 300 branches
and our focus and really going out and looking at that small business market. We'll see. There's a lot of work
involved in that and there's a lot of referrals to follow up on and giving customers on boarded. The teams worked
extremely hard during that time. So, you know, we'll look to take a little breather and I'd say look into the second
quarter, later into the quarter, and we'll announce probably another focus, maybe something very similar.
So that's one piece as far as the gathering of new names and pretty excited about the non-interest bearing
balances that are coming in on that specific customer segment to-date, or I said in the prepared remarks, actually,
as of last night, we're up to about 5,300 accounts and $314 million in deposits. And those accounts are
maintaining their balances are higher than our average balance that we currently have. And they continue to
come in at a nice pace. We've got another five days or so to run.
The other pieces are really around – we talked in the fourth quarter and we talked in the first quarter about those
results, about CDs and things of that nature. Really looking at the roll on all of those where they're coming in,
there's a lot less coming due in the second quarter as we had previously talked about. The delta on that to where

today's rates are is nowhere near as great, which is good news. And then on the other side, as we move
throughout the year, there's some opportunities, all things being equal with rates as they are today. We have
some opportunities to begin to lower a lot of those rates as well. So, I don't have the specifics that I can share with
you right this second. But as I said, as we go throughout the year, we'll start to see that CD base change and start
to bring those rates down as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David, this is Tory. I want to just add a couple of things to it on the commercial side. We've identified couple
of, I think, big pieces in the commercial side of the house where we've got a lot of opportunity for some deposit
growth. I mean, most notably our FinPac portfolio and our multifamily portfolio, which traditionally have been more
transactional [indiscernible] (00:26:12) plan in place to go after and make them full-fledged customers and
relationships for the company. So feel very good about just kicking that off and hoping to see some really strong
results as the year progresses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just touching on credit more broadly. You talked about recalibrating the CECL
model. Could you maybe touch a little bit about, what went into that and kind of the methodology there? It looks
like we increased reserves on CRE and maybe reduced a little bit to commercial and then, but, more broadly, it
seems like FinPac is kind of stabilized a bit, curious what happened to that one commercial credit, which was the
larger driver of losses? And then just again, broader commentary on what you're seeing on the credit front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Dave. This is Ron. I'll start off on the front just in terms of the CECL models themselves. I'd characterize it
as just a better reflection of the combined company's historical loss experience within the commercial and in the
recalibration of those models to drive towards that lower reduction. But you're right, it was a bit of a shift, right? A
little lower in commercial, just given lower historical loss rates, a little bit higher in the commercial real estate
categories. Again – and those are based off of not loan level items. Those are based of economic forecasts for
rents and vacancies in western downtown core, slightly deteriorating quarter-on-quarter. So that's something
we're seeing on the ground with our customers, just given the composition of the portfolio. But it is one of the
drivers of the CECL models. And Frank, I'll turn it over to you for the second half of that about [ph] credit overall
(00:27:59) and FinPac.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. FinPac continues to perform as we expected it to. To your point, I mean, it is the losses have peaked. They
are leveling out. And we'll have a period of leveling out before we see it notably drop. And we expect that drop
somewhere around the third quarter continuing on through the year-end as we migrate back down to that 3.5%-
ish run rate in charge offs. We consistently do a deep dive within that portfolio and slice and dice it every which
way, looking for patterns of any other systemic-type activity developing within the portfolio.
And we see that it's really not what we are seeing as is, in particular, in the 61- to 90-day delinquency bucket,
which is a key delinquency range that a great deal of those feed into non-performing and eventually the loss we're
seeing that decrease. So those levels are at lowest levels that we've seen in several quarters. So that's very

encouraging that a lot of the work we did many quarters ago to tighten up underwriting standards and the model
are indeed working, so that is encouraging.
And with regard to the CRE, in particular multifamily, office, I continue to be just extremely impressed at the
resiliency of the portfolio, especially in those two verticals that are under the watchful eye of so many right now.
Really nothing exciting going on within either one of those portfolios. It's really quite boring, which somebody like
me loves to see. And so, I'm very pleased and let's – we continue to watch all these portfolios extremely closely
for changes. And for us, it's important to stay ahead of it and that's what we're doing.

Barclays. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Yeah, maybe looking at first at capital. You've been able to grow
capital really nicely. And as you said, get your long-term targets. Does this provide opportunity to maybe look at
accelerating or seeing better growth on the loan side earlier than expected, or is the outlook for earning asset
growth really more market driven than capital driven at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, it's – from my perspective, it's more market driven. We continue to see even it's a psychological
phenomenon with our customers and some of them where rather than borrow money at high 8s, low 9s, even
though they're getting 4s and 5s in terms of their cash. So from a net spread standpoint, it's really not much
different than before the Fed started tightening. But psychologically they haven't for over a decade seen borrowed
money at those rates and so they're just using their own cash. Some are just kind of sitting on the sidelines
waiting for opportunities, to see if maybe some of their competitors struggle and they're able to do some things
there. So there's a little bit of people keeping some dry powder, using their own cash. And then just more of a
demand side.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
I would say it's the funding side more than anything. We saw an influx of deposits and we might look at ways of
growing earning assets. But right now, our focus is the loan to deposit ratios at a level that we're comfortable with.
We could see that go a little higher. We'd be comfortable with that. But we're not really actively looking to grow the
balance sheet. It's more along the lines of the expense initiative and everything else. It's about driving improved
profitability for the company. I don't know if Tory or Chris or Ron have a different perspective or an additional
perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, same thing. Obviously, this is Tory. I just think that I talk a little bit about pipeline. Pipeline has been pretty
steady over the last two or three quarters, but the shift, the mix has changed. And it's kind of shifted where we've
got some nice growth on the C&I front in the pipeline and then a reduction in real estate, which is absolutely in
line with everything we've been talking about for a while. And it really fits the strategic direction for the company.
So feel positive about the opportunities throughout the franchise to grow the C&I book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. Yeah. And actually I guess sort of correlated to that. Your – looks like the CRE capital
concentration is below sort of that 300% threshold now. Would you like to see that continue to trend lower or do
you feel comfortable with where the mix of the loan portfolio is here and future growth will just more be dependent
on the market, or should we expect you to continue to bring that concentration lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think over the long term, you will see that, that drift down. And that's back to Tory's comment regarding the C&I
pipeline, the relationship aspect. Our C&I customers, they own real estate. We have relationships. Some of our
wealth management customers are in the real estate business. We're always going to be active in the CRE
space. But I think that the focus on as a combined company the things that we're able to do now that individually
maybe we couldn't or we couldn't fully do, I think you're going to see that level that concentration level will stay
under that 300% over the long run. That doesn't mean there won't be variability from quarter to quarter. We have
commitments out there that are funding right now and driving some balances on the CRE side, but if we're fast
forwarding 12, 24, 36, 60 months, I would fully expect to see that under 300%.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to try to chase down the loan and deposit growth expectations for this year. I
think you've talked about relationship-driven loans and the moves you've made on the deposit side, but I just
trying to get a good direction of is that kind of low-single-digit growth for both.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, this is Tory. I'll start and Chris can chime in. I think that's well said. Low-single digits for both with the
mix on the loan growth side as best as we can to make that C&I focused. But as Clint said, there are some growth
this quarter that is just construction projects [indiscernible] (00:36:43) construction. But the lending side that the
primary focus is going to be C&I and it's full banking relationship. So what comes with it is as much on the deposit
front as possible, large operating accounts and non-interest bearing balances and then I think a really strong
robust core fee income pipeline. So, Chris, do you want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, not on the loan side, but on the deposit side, that's a good target. I would look at there's a lot of variables that
could come into that. How long does inflation remain, where it's out, Jeff, and how much money keeps coming out
of the system, those are obviously going to impact it. So, we're focused on – if we can drive the new relationships
across the bank, both retail, wealth and into commercial as well, and drive relationship deposit growth, and it's
really focusing much more on what that mix is and keeping the cost as low as possible. If we were to go out and
run a promotion and put a big rate out there, we could certainly drive deposits, but those wouldn't be necessarily
the right type of deposits for the long-term strategic plan of the company. But again, a good place to start. I think
there's a lot of variables, but the teams are going to roll up their sleeves and work really hard to keep driving
relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. And one quick one on the margin. I think in the deck you've kind of cautioned that maybe [ph] that
haven't seen the cycle floor (00:38:11) yet and that would be reflective of your guide. The range is right in the
middle of the 3.45%, 3.60%. I want to just – if we were to pick that apart, it sounds like second quarter given
seasonality that maybe you'd caution maybe on that, if you were to be in that range, you'd be on the lower side
and be sort of exiting the year potentially trending towards the higher end. Is that correct in terms of thinking more
pressure upfront in the year and easing, especially given sort of deposit rates and what's occurring in the first
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey Jeff, this is Ron here. And that's close, and again, the bigger driver over the course of the year where we end
up in that range [indiscernible] (00:39:00) core deposit flows, even more so than if the Fed cuts three times or
doesn't move. Right? That's given how neutral we are. Relatively neutral [indiscernible] (00:39:11) more so based
off of deposit flows. So, seasonally, we usually see tax time DDA outflows and then they rebuild into Q3. So you
could see that fluctuation within the range driven by that. We'll see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.

Citi. Your line is open.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.

Clint E. Stein A

Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I know that you guys gave quite a bit of color on the margin already, but the repricing of deposits is clearly the
biggest hit for this one for you. I know you gave guidance that the kind of pig in the python here is much less there
than it was in deposit pricing. I am just curious can you quantify what the next six months or so in terms of what
yield might be and any sort of specials that are running on [indiscernible] (00:40:18) just on pricing in general for
the next six months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So Ben, this is Chris. I'll start with the pricing aspect of it that, yeah, there's no plan for promotional types of – true
promotional special types of pricing. It's really it's a pricing that we have out there. We continue to monitor it to the
market and where we want to be within that range. Some of it obviously depends on what competitors do and
what's out there. We have the ability to exception price if we need to match a competitor or something like that. I
think that if you look at some of the other things and you look at the peak of the rates, money markets were
around 5%. They're down to 4.15% to 4.3%. CDs peaked at about 5.25%. Those are down to 3.9% to 4.55%. And
that includes a lot of factors that are in there. And those are really just kind of the posted rates.
I think, over the course of the year, we've talked previously about second quarter we have a lot lower repricing of
CD's and then it'll build back into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Now when it builds into the third and
the fourth quarter, those are on at rates that are, I'll call them, higher than they are today. And so, all things being
equal, we should have a nice reduction from where they're currently at to where they would renew and continue to
move forward. So hopefully that answers your question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes, that was helpful color. And then I saw that on pages, slide 6, we've broadening presence across the
Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake, Vegas, all the way to kind of West Coast cities, that you don't have a huge presence
[indiscernible] (00:42:12) aspirational but that's it's not like the next 12 months to really kind of [indiscernible]
(00:42:20) the next target phases to think about. Just trying to how to frame it relative to today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We're in all of those cities. All the dots you see on the maps, we're there. We've been there. We put our first retail
location in the Utah market last fall. We've had teams in Colorado. We actually have – the next phase of that is to

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
support those teams with retail banking capabilities and deposit taking capabilities, and we have the projects in
flight to do that in Colorado. Actually, this quarter, we will open two retail locations in the Phoenix metro market.
It's really – it's a – I think how to think about those markets is, it's full banking services, but it's really leading with
commercial banking. And so it's a branch-light type model that's different than what we have in our legacy
markets here in the Northwest, where we've been for 70 years and where we've built our market share by
acquiring a lot of banks.
So in this instance, we're able to specify exactly which locations, which communities we want to be in, which ones
are conducive to our strategy and our business model. Some of the work that we're doing on the expense front is
really to – it's just a reallocation of resources. It's how do we free up resources so that we're not an outlier on an
expense standpoint, but that we're able to also drive future shareholder value and franchise value by having the
appropriate presence in these very, very robust, desirable Western markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey Ben, this is Tory. I just want to add something to Clint's comments, I think, are just spot on. You know, there's
this idea of expansion into markets like Utah and Colorado and in Arizona are very comparable to what I think
both banks have done over the course of time to find a really good commercial team and put them in market and
then have a supporting cast around them, which eventually is a retail presence and some deposit-taking
capabilities to support it. It's interesting we've been in these markets all of them for about 18 months or less,
maybe a couple of years at them, very, very most, and all three are operating in the black and are very
successful.
So it's a great strategy. I think it's minimal investment out of the gate and then we just build on it from there. So I
think we're all really happy with the way those things are working out. And then I think [ph] Clint kind of said
(00:45:27) Southern California is just a place where we've done that over the course of the years and have been
very, very successful. And there's just so much opportunity with the density of number of customers or companies
that exist down in Southern California, that's just a logical, further continued investment for us.

Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe looking again at the margin, I just want to see the 3.55% margin for the month of March. Is that fully baking
in the price reductions on the wholesale and promotional fundings, or does that actually trend higher maybe as
that effect fully kicks in and then you get some of the more moderate pricing pressures off of that base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
This is Ron. It bakes in a good chunk of it just given the majority of that, those adjustments were in February. So
when you look at the month of March itself, there were still reductions throughout the month, but the majority
occurred prior too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then on the upside, it looks like just the one-off items mentioned in the appendix. That's a core
expense of $276,000. Ron, you had mentioned that normalizes that $286,000, that it kind of cut off as you
mentioned what that driver was just, what's the tie back from that $276,000 that looks to be core versus the
$286,000 normalized we should be using?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, $286,000 is definitely the number to be using there. Just a handful of one-off items that happen to be
credits. So, just various credit entries. Whereas in the fourth quarter, they were mostly debit entries.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just last for me, the migration of credit on the SBA specifically, we saw another competitor
today talked to similar trends. I know you guys are a big SBA lender in your geography. Can you just remind us
the size of that portfolio and maybe some nuances about it? What portion of that is guaranteed and maybe some
other characteristics of that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's about – this is Frank. It's about $600 million. And they've historically done a lot of business acquisition type
financing. And that's really where the losses have been centered as it is in that specific space. And, obviously,
business acquisition, smaller borrowers, those are the ones in a rates up environment, in a higher rate
environment are going to be adversely impacted. And that's what you're seeing. I mean, it's in no way indicative of
more of a spread than that.
And the guarantees on those credit obligations can run anywhere from 50% to 90%. So the escalation that you
saw in the NPLs attributable to SBA is, I mean, should they go to loss, they will generally be guaranteed by some
portion. On average, it's about 75%. And the balance of the increase, Timur, is really centered in a single credit in
the C&I space of which we are well collateralized. And there is significant interest in this particular property and I
expect this one will probably be gone within the next quarter or two at the latest.

Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Timur, this is Tory. I think it'd be good just to kind of highlight a strategic shift in our SBA business as we had
historically been a more, I think, full-fledged nation-wide lender looking for gain on sale and kind of restructured
and through a strategic initiative to have a focus – SBA group to focus exclusively on referrals from retail banking
and commercial banking and customers of the bank, and just kind of changing the business model a bit, which I
think will bring us in footprint and have us focus quite nicely like we do everywhere else in the company where it's
about full relationship banking and it's about our existing customers or new prospects that we bring into the
company. So a shift for us, but I think a really good shift.

Hey, could you please characterize the deposit – non-interest bearing deposit outflows you still seeing? I believe
some of the commentary is around inflationary pressures, but wondering if some of that is also attribute to mix
shift.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey Brandon, this is Ron. I think [ph] here early in the (00:51:07) same quarter, it's going to be mostly tax related
seasonally where both banks have seen their combined. In the first quarter again, it was a continuation of the
trends from Q4 in the month of January, but then initiatives underway helped in February, March as balances
were flat, which was great to see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, this is Chris. I'll add to that, yeah, the mix, it continues to have some shifting in it, higher for longer is going
to continue that customers are going to continue to look at that and continue to make choices and decisions. We
follow it on that the money actually leave – doesn't leave our balance sheet and we're seeing it either be spent or
we're seeing it shift into higher earning products.

Brandon, [indiscernible] (00:52:08) just on the commercial side of the house, which is [indiscernible] (00:52:11)
but it's really closer to three quarters of what excess non-interest-bearing just gets repriced into a interest-bearing
account, whether money market or whatever. And then the balance of that at this point over the last couple of
quarters has been spent on either distributions, taxes, dividends, et cetera. So that's a rough ballpark of what
we've seen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Very helpful. And then with the changes in how you're pricing certain deposits, could you talk about
the retention of those same deposit categories, has that been affected at all? And if – just the goal is to kind of
whatever you lose from a retention standpoint to kind of make up with these new initiatives.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, that – most of that comes in, Brandon, in the CD portfolio that we track that to where pretty much on given
month we renew approximately 87%, 88% of our CDs either renew, move into a different – in different term or
they auto renew. And so that number has been very consistent over time. It can vary. It can vary based on what
our rates are at the time, but we can lay that over the next 13 months and really kind of have a good idea of, all
things being equal, where we want to be. And so we can control a bit of that renewal activity. But that's a pretty
solid number for what rolls over each and every month.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Clint, just quickly on the – I think I heard in your prepared remarks discussion around kind of the TCE ratio and
targeting 8% there versus I think you're at 6.6% today. We've talked about kind of the total risk based capital
target of 12% for a few quarters now. I guess I just am curious what kind of drove that kind of change in the line of
thinking and maybe more focus on the TCE ratio now just given we've talked about the total risk base for a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. No, it's a good clarifying question. I don't know. It's been probably 15 years since Columbia kind of set its
long-term target capital ratios. And what we always said was 12% total risk base or 8% TCE and where we've
been focused on are those regulatory ratios. They're not really out of alignment. If you look at, I think we're
roughly 11.7% is what we expect to be total risk base at the bank level parent company, as I mentioned, is 12%.
Next quarter, quarter and a half, the bank should move to that 12% level. At the same time, that's going to push
TCE up. And then if you just look at where we're at with AOCI and you add that back in, you're pretty much in the
ballpark of an 8% TCE ratio.
So I don't think it's too far off, but I just think that it's something that we do monitor, we have monitored for a long
period of time. I think it's artificially lowered because of the capital impact of the rate marks with purchase
accounting and then just where we're at right now with current rate levels. That doesn't mean that that's a hard
floor. That doesn't mean that we won't look opportunistically the market. I personally believe the market has our
valuation wrong and has for the last couple of years. And so it doesn't mean that when there's volatility and
there's opportunities that we won't take strategic advantage of when we feel like that that's gotten even outsized
from where it should be. But just broadly want to get that out there that anything that's very major or meaningful in
terms of shifting numbers and calculations, probably won't occur until we're within eyesight of that 8% TCE level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Understood. Okay. I appreciate the clarification there. And then maybe just one, a lot of my were asked and
addressed already, but the $14 million commercial loan that was charged off this quarter, was that previously
sitting in non-accruals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. This is Frank. Yeah. During the quarter, we had really an extraordinary situation develop pretty quickly in
which C&I relationship itself discovered a pretty complex and significant internal fraud, which drove the company
quickly into a bankruptcy situation. And so given the nature of the fraud, the uncertainty surrounding the true
collateral, various pending investigations going on presently and really future potential litigation, we took the, I
would say, decisive quick and conservative move to charge off the outstanding balance now and really look to
recover any proceeds as we move through the process. And, given what's going on, I think that's probably really
all I can talk about with regard to the subject right now, but that's really what drove that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q

Okay. Understood. I appreciate the added color there and thanks for taking the questions.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Clint, maybe on the disclosure in the deck about a couple billion of loans that you don't give us
long-term strategic, but the rate environment doesn't lend to moving them. I guess, what is it about these loans?
And I guess, what would it take for you to kind of flip the switch on those and dispose those or look to sell them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, that kind of plays into the earlier question about CRE levels and where we see those over the long run. A
checking account, a wealth management relationship, an operating account, anything of that nature would change
how I view the segment of the portfolio that we've kind of highlighted there in the slide deck. Those are
predominantly the multifamily division portfolio and Tory shuttered that about a year ago, so that's a wind-down
portfolio. The other one would be single family resi loans that we don't have any other relationship with and that's
kind of a legacy product from when the home lending group was structured more like a mortgage company as
opposed to how we have it structured today or how it was restructured just shortly before the merger closed,
which is truly a mortgage division of the bank that supports our customers and their activities and needs.
So, that's some of the initiatives that I know Chris and Tory are working on is the rate environment buys them,
affords them time to go out and we have loans with these individuals and organizations. And so, can they convert
them into a relationship, and if they can, then great. That helps us on the deposit front and it would be something
we would keep. But if they can't, then when market conditions are right, well then we'll take a very hard look at
exiting those out of the portfolio, which then would also lower that CRE concentration level.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up, Clint, if we just zoom out like normalized charge offs, right, you've got the
FinPac book that's running higher, but normalizing. How do I think about normalized charge offs in this
environment for the bank on a consolidated basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's one of the things we talk about even internally is that the normalized level for FinPac is what
3.5% roughly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I would say 3.5% to 4%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And it was running, what 5%?

Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
5.5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
5.5% or so. And so we see that kind of coming back. But then it skews the overall bank numbers. So, as we move
forward, we'll do a better job at trying to bifurcate. So you can see kind of where FinPac's at on a normalized level
as well as where the bank's at. I think from an expectation standpoint, Frank, correct me if I'm wrong, but I mean
what we're seeing in terms of credit, what we're seeing in terms of the output of our CECL model, probably, look
at that normalization in FinPac and then just carve out what the bank's experience has been over the last three or
four quarters. If I was running a model, that's probably what I would model going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That's fair. I would say that's fair representation of what you should do. Yeah.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jon Arfstrom of
RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks, everyone. Question for you guys that maybe [indiscernible] (01:03:20) hasn't been touched on is fee
income and your expectations there I know it's a smaller revenue contribution, but I think maybe that's the only
thing we haven't touched on from P&L, what kind of expectations do you have there? And I guess, I'm somewhat
interested in the wealth business and mortgage in particular.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey Jon, this is Tory. I'll kick it off and then turn it over to Chris on the wealth side. I think when the two banks
came together, there were a few places where – there were a lot of places we were excited about but there is a
few places we were really, really excited about. And one of them is the fee income side because there were some
products and some capabilities that I think Umpqua Bank brought in that the Columbia Bank customers had a
need for and just not a product set to kind of serve it. So, we are – our pipeline on the fee income side just
continues to grow every single month. And it's a byproduct of a lot of hard work by all of the folks in the bank,
whether it's retail or commercial or anywhere else.
And the growth has been – I think I'd probably point out three areas in particular, treasury management,
commercial card, and then international banking would be kind of the three that I would see follow probably
closely by merchants. And again, the pipeline is $10 million and it's moving up every day. And it's a really good
thing for the company and for our customers. And so we feel pretty confident about where we are and where
we're going with it.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, it's Chris. Yeah, I would say in the mortgage where we're at, if you look back over the past couple of
quarters is a really good spot. It's kind of settled into that range over the last couple of quarters, focused much
more on held for sale. And as Clint mentioned, taking care of our customer base. We still have portfolio product
and we'll do that for customers. But the mix is definitely shifted on there. And, as we move into the summer
season, when you're looking at, it's predominantly purchase business, there is a bit of refi in there still. Whether
you start moving into the summer a little bit, we may see a bit of an uptick in the overall production second
quarter, third quarter and all things being equal with rates as they are today.
The wealth business, if you recall, we did our platform conversion during the fourth quarter last year in October.
And I'm pretty happy to say that that's settled in extremely well. The advisors understand the system. They're
communicating with their customers. The customer experience has improved dramatically from the system we
were – the broker dealer were with before, and so I think that shows some real signs of upward mobility as we
continue to move beyond that conversion. And then on the trust side, we're getting more and more opportunities
working with our partners within the bank, especially within the commercial side, where we've got business sales,
we've got lots of owners, and that is really becoming a part of the team working together. And the pipeline there is
better than it's been in the past. So pretty exciting there. We'll look to move into some of our newer markets in
those spaces. It's a matter of finding the talent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Thank you. Thank you on that. And then maybe, Clint, one last one for you. You seem pretty laser focused
on top quartile type performance. And I would just ask, what do you look at specifically for that? And I know you're
frustrated with the valuation, but, as analysts we look at return on tangible and how that – how your price to
tangible book looks. And if you can continue to put up these kinds of [indiscernible] (01:07:18), your stock price
should clearly go up. But what are you looking at? How do you measure that success? And how do you think that
stuff looks by the end of the year when this efficiency program is fully kicked in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Well, we certainly do look at our return on tangible and that has been – on a peer comparison level, that
has been favorable. But we also have a lower ratio. Our view is and I think in my prepared remarks I said across
all financial metrics, our view is pick a metric, because from time to time, things will look different. You know,
there's things that are in focus at different times, as you know. But wherever our peer set is, then we want to
screen in the top quartile. And if it's on return on tangible, if it's ROAA that somebody is looking at, if it's deposit
mix, composition, pretty much anything along those lines.
And so, that's I guess where we're focused is the franchise that we thought we could create with this merger is
here. It's in front of us. We've been running it for a year. And now what we're doing is, is internally we talk about
its operational excellence and what are the things that we can do to improve those operations and rightsizing the
expense base, we were an outlier. If we looked at the expense ratio, we were an outlier. We knew that. We had
year one, which was keep our people, keep our customers and drive value across the organization.
Now we're in year two, the IMO was shut down. We're focused on now delivering the full capabilities and the full
financial performance and earnings power of this company. It's a difficult environment. It's difficult for everybody.
But that's okay. That's one of the reasons that we did this merger was to give ourselves additional scale and

resiliency to navigate through any type of business cycle. So probably more than what you wanted on this. But I
would say, pick a metric and if we're not there, we're looking at how do we get our company into that top quartile.
