Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to Western Alliance Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings
Calls. You may also view the presentation today via webcast through the company's website at
www.westernalliancebancorporation.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Miles Pondelik, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Development.
Go ahead.

Miles Pondelik
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Development, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, and welcome to Western Alliance Bank's fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Our speakers today are
Ken Vecchione, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Dale Gibbons, Chief Financial Officer.
Before I hand the call over to Ken, please note that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements,
which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Except as required by law, the company does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For a more complete discussion of the risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, please

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Miles. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide an overview of our 2022 performance, and then
preface our approach to 2023 before Dale reviews the bank's financial performance. I should also mention that
Tim Bruckner, our Chief Credit Officer, is also in the room with us today.
Western Alliance had a strong year in 2022. Our diversified national commercial bank group loans 28%, deposits
by nearly 13% and posted record net revenue and net income growth of 30% and 17.6%, respectively. We
accomplished all this while maintaining strong and stable asset quality as net charge-offs to average loans were
approximately 0% for the year, while nonperforming assets to total assets improved to 14 basis points. Balance
sheet is well-positioned to weather an evolving environment, as 27% of the loan portfolio is credit-protected and
53% of the loans can be classified as insured or economically-resistant. Our goal is to emerge from this slowing
or recessionary environment as a top-performing asset quality bank in our peer group, a position we currently
occupy.
For 2023, the higher interest rate environment and slowing economy will generate headwinds for the banking
industry. As I mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, WAL is focused on bolstering CET1 levels, restraining loan
originations with deposit growth, outpacing loan growth while maintaining leading asset quality and growing year-
over-year earnings. We are pleased with the substantial progress made towards this goal. Our CET1 ratio ended
the year at 9.32%, which was over 60 basis points higher than the previous quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
The rising capital was driven by purposefully reducing approximately $1.8 billion in certain low-margin, low-
deposit categories, such as capital called, and subscription lines and corporate finance syndications. Without
these actions, quarterly held for investment loans would have grown $1.5 billion and generated incremental
interest income.
Our ongoing investments in diversified deposit businesses should provide liquidity for excess on loan growth. Q4
ending deposits declined $1.9 billion from last quarter while average deposits declined by only $295 million
quarter-over-quarter. This decline was primarily driven by short-term seasonal tax and insurance escrow deposit
outflows from the Mortgage Warehouse Group, which has since recovered, with Q1 quarter-to-date average
deposit balances up more than $2.4 billion from year end.
Previous investments in our settlement services, business escrow and HOA deposit businesses, as well as the
soon to be launched corporate trust platform, combined with several other initiatives we look to allow, provide
meaningful opportunities to gather incremental deposits this year. We look for predictable balance sheet growth to
improve NIM and grow net interest income in 2023. After Dale's comment, I will discuss our 2023 outlook in more
detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. For the year, Western Alliance produced record net revenues of $2.5 billion; net income over $1
billion; and EPS of $9.70, 14th consecutive year of rising earnings. We maintained interest-leading performance
with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 162% and 25%, respectively.
Grew tangible book value per share to $40.25, 6.4% higher year-over-year.
Ken mentioned we previously identified a near-term priority of bolstering our key capital ratios. We're pleased with
the substantial progress made toward this goal with our CET1 ratio increasing over 60 basis points to 9.3% in Q4.
This strategy led us to proactively restrain balance sheet growth without inhibiting record net interest income and
earnings.
For the year, net interest income increased 43% to $2.2 billion. Our diversified deposit franchises are focused on
generating attractive core funding that drives net interest income and EPS higher, presently purely minimizing
deposit basis to maximize the interest margin. Noninterest income declined $80 million to $325 million as a result
of ongoing softness in the mortgage industry. However, improved mortgage-related revenue in Q4 and the
pending withdrawal of a large money center bank from the corresponding mortgage business suggests gain on
sale margins and core servicing income could be in the very early stages of stabilizing.
Finally, asset quality remains stable and strong. And classified and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total
assets are still lower than pre-pandemic levels. All this dramatically transforms this business over the last decade
to become a national commercial bank focused on deep segment expertise, underwriting specialization and
greater business diversification. For the year, Western Alliance recorded net charge-offs of just $1.5 million or
less than 1 basis points of average loans.
Turning to fourth quarter trends and business drivers, Western Alliance generated net income of $293 million,
EPS of $2.67 and pre-provision net revenue of $368 million. Operating EPS was $2.74, or $9.95 for all of 2022.
Total net revenue was $701 million, an increase of $37 million during the quarter or 25% year-over-year. Net
interest income increased 6% from Q3 to $640 million; was primarily driven by NIM expansion, but also benefited
from higher average earning asset balances. During the quarter, the company completed a credit-linked note
transaction, bringing 2022 issuances to total $579 million.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
As of year-end, the company is protected from first credit losses on referenced pools of loans, totaling $12 billion.
Overall, noninterest income remained essentially flat from the prior quarter at $61.5 million, as mortgage banking
related revenue increased $9 million to approximately $47 million. Increase was partially offset by a $9.2 million
mark-to-market charge included in other income. Noninterest expense included – increased 9% or $27 million,
resulting in efficiency ratio of approximately 47%, primarily due to higher deposit costs related to earnings credits.
The addition to ratio was adjusted to classify deposit costs as interest expense. The 40% that's remaining
operating expenses were essentially flat.
Turning now to net interest drivers, our asset-sensitive balance sheet benefited from the rising rate environment.
The risk investment yields increased 79 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.45%, as variable rate securities
reprice higher. On a linked-quarter basis, loan yields increased 86 basis points to 5.70% with and end-of-quarter
spot rate of 6.26%. Loans held for sale benefited from rising mortgage rates, an increase 76 basis points to
5.63%.
Irrespective of the Federal Reserve's rate trajectory, our net interest income will continue to benefit from an
average of $2.5 billion of loans maturing or repricing higher each quarter in 2023, wherein fixed rate loans are
being replaced by these loans that yield over 2% higher, while variable rate loans are repricing in a spread 50
basis points wider on average.
Full funding costs, including borrowings and deposits increased 69 basis points to 1.57% as the use of CDs and
short-term borrowings increased as a proportion of average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income growth
of $38 million or 6% on a linked-quarter basis was powered by a 20-basis-point NIM expansion and a modest
increase in average interest-earning assets. The increase in total interest income continues to be greater than the
change in total funding costs, including ECR expenses, demonstrating our continued asset sensitivity.
The rate shock analysis shows that with a plus 100 basis points shock on a static balance sheet, net interest
income is expected to lift over 3%. Using the same scenario on a gross balance sheet, we would expect net
interest income to grow over 20%. Soon the rates decline, as some were projecting, that might happen later this
year. The growth balance sheet, net interest income still rises coincident with our decreasing asset sensitivity
profile.
Our efficiency ratio increased 140 basis points to approximately 47%. After reclassifying deposit costs as interest
expense, adjusted efficiency was essentially flat and 40%, again demonstrating the high operating leverage of the
company. Deposit costs increased $26 million from the prior quarter due to higher earnings credit rates on
deposits, but at a slower rate than Q3 as earnings credit rate paying demand deposits declined.
Pre-provision net revenue climbed 3% to a record $368 million or 14% increase year-over-year, resulted in return
on average tangible common equity, excluding all other comprehensive income is 3% for the quarter or 80 basis
points higher than last quarter. Western Alliance's leading organic capital generation and continued strong
performance provides significant flexibility to fund balance sheet growth, build capital ratios and meet credit
demands.
Hotel for investment decreased $339 million to $51.2 billion and deposits declined $1.9 billion to $53.6 billion at
year-end, primarily driven by short-term seasonal Mortgage Warehouse factors. Total borrowings fell $16 million
over the prior quarter, primarily from a decline in short-term borrowings, offset by issuance of $95 million in credit-
linked notes on a reference pool of residential loans.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Finally, intangible book value per share increased $3.09 or 8% over the prior quarter and [audio gap] (00:11:34)
year-over-year to $40.25 with a small organic earnings, along with reduced drag from-available-for-sale securities
margin recorded in AOCI. [audio gap] (00:11:46) quarter, net loan growth is impacted by our purposeful decision
to temper certain C&I loan categories, as equity fund resources and to a lesser extent, corporate finance by
approximately $1.8 billion in total. Excluding these reductions, C&I loans would have grown $220 million with total
loans held for investment growth of $1.5 billion on a linked-quarter basis.
[audio gap] (00:12:10) C&I growth was driven by $651 million from sponsor-backed commercial real estate, $390
million from construction and $250 million from residential. Additionally, the breadth of our business lines
generated healthy loan demand in regional banking, which was $696 million higher than Q3. Hotel franchise
finance rose $315 million, and tech and innovation was up $140 million.
We are well well-positioned to maintain prudent growth in a more uncertain economic environment, given our
diversified loan mix between national business lines, residential real estate and regional banking. Over the last
three years, 68% of our robust loan growth has come from low to no-loss categories, which now account for 53%
of our entire portfolio. Furthermore, we have structured additional loss prevention as 27% of loans are credit-
protected, which should fortify our industry-leading asset quality.
Turning to deposits, competition for funding picks up during the quarter and larger than expected seasonal factors
combined to temporarily reduce deposit balances. Early deposits declined $1.9 billion, primarily driven by short-
term seasonal escrow deposit outflows in our Mortgage Warehouse Group, which are included in noninterest-
bearing deposits but subject to earnings credit rates. Ken mentioned, these seasonal factors have reversed since
year end, with Mortgage Warehouse Q1 quarter-to-date average balances already at more than $2 billion from
year end or 15% higher from the same period year-over-year. Additionally, quarter-to-date average balances for
total deposits are up more than $2.4 billion from 12/31 and approximately $660 million greater than 4Q's average
balance.
Mortgage Warehouse comprised 65% to the reduction in noninterest-bearing DDA. End-of-year seasonality is
evident in the linked-quarter decline, an average deposits of only $295 million, versus the more pronounced
decline on a period-end basis. Increased competition for liquidity in a higher rate environment drove an 11%
increase in total interest-bearing deposits, including a $1.9 billion growth in CDs. Interest-bearing demand
deposits were $1.2 billion from last quarter in part for migration from noninterest-bearing DDA.
Diversified deposit franchise continues to provide meaningful opportunities to generate attractive funding to
support loan growth. Among our scalable national business lines, we're pleased with the continuing momentum in
settlement services and homeowners' associations. It produced linked-quarter growth of $680 million and nearly
$300 million, respectively. Going forward, we expect continued growth for our deposit business lines, including
business escrow services, to continue to generate attractive deposits, fund ongoing balance sheet growth and
soften the impact of elevated rates on overall funding costs.
Our asset quality remains strong and stable. Classified assets and nonperforming assets as a percentage of the
total are still lower than pre-pandemic levels. Total classified assets increased $8 million in Q4 to 58 basis points
from total assets, only 2 basis points higher than Q3. Total nonperforming assets to total assets were down 1
basis point from last quarter to 14.
The prospects for greater economic volatility continue to evolve. We believe our underwriting discipline borne out
of our national business line strategies has prepared us well for additional credit stress and the accompanying
greater macro headwinds. However, we have not observed any preliminary signs of material uptick in credit

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
migration trends. And we also expect to steadily reduce our exposure to the more sensitive loan category this
year.
Sound asset quality decisions will dictate our thoughtful loan growth trajectory and enable us to maintain
profitability despite heightened economic uncertainty. Early net charge-offs of $1.8 million in the quarter or 1 basis
point of average loans of the full-year 2022 net charge-offs to $1.5 million. Those quarterly charge-offs had been
stable at approximately $2 million per quarter for the past year, while net charge-off variances result from volatility
and recoveries. Operation expense for credit losses was $3.1 million, primarily due to uncertainties surrounding
[indiscernible] (00:16:37) recession, offset by risk-weighted asset optimization efforts, sale of corporate finance
syndications and reducing capital call and subscription line exposure.
Base case for a mild recession was the allowance for credit losses assumptions weighted toward the Moody's
concensus forecast, which has shifted toward increasing the [indiscernible] (00:16:57) more conservative
scenario. Total loan ACL to funded loans was 69 basis points, while our ACL to nonaccrual loans was 420% at
year-end, adjusting for the $12 million of loans covered by credit-linked notes where ample first loss coverage is
assumed by a third party. The ACL coverage rises to 89 basis points.
We believe these superior asset quality trends are sustainable throughout economic cycles through the Western
Alliance's deliberate post-GFC business transformation strategy. Going back to that time period, nearly 70% of
losses Western Alliance incurred during the great financial crisis came from loan categories comprising 44% of
the [audio gap] (00:17:41) loan portfolio. In those, categories make up less than 6% of total loans.
In contrast, 87% of the current portfolio was insured [audio gap] (00:17:53) in resilient categories. The insured
category consists of credit protected, government guarantees and cash secured loans. Resistant loans are
categories at historically low or no loan losses. These categories have experienced de minimis losses since 2014.
Resilient loans are supported by strong collateral and counterparties, as well as our underwriting expertise. While
this category might experience some great migration, realized losses are minimal due to limited recovery and
uncovered collateral risk, with average losses at only 2 basis points and a maximum quarterly annualized loss of
just 16 basis points.
13% of the portfolio we grew is more sensitive to economic growth. Our lending in this category has been focused
on unique subsegments that offer the highest risk-adjusted returns, and where we leverage our sector knowledge
and underwriting capabilities to maintain superior relative asset quality. Since 2014, these loans have
experienced a maximum quarterly annualized loss rate of only 71 basis points, with average losses of 5 basis
points.
Exceptional post-GFC asset quality has been highlighted by minimal net charge-offs of only $29 million since the
beginning of 2014. Comparing our performance to the 32 publicly-held banks with assets between $25 billion and
$150 billion based on the United States, we realized the lowest average net charge-offs and the lowest quarterly
annualized maximum charge-offs as a percentage of total loans over the same time period. While the past
decade has been a period of relatively low credit stress, our leading performance in low average losses, and more
importantly, the lowest loss volatility among peers, bodes well as to how Western Alliance will outperform peers, if
and when, credit stress becomes more acute.
On our last earnings call, we discussed our renewed focus to rebuild capital and have made strong progress so
far. Our tangible common equity and total assets ratio of 6.5%, common equity Tier 1 of 9.3% were both
materially higher quarter-over-quarter. In our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to

generate significant capital to fund organic growth and to lift well-capitalized regulatory ratios. The strong capital
generation during this quarter is the equivalent of issuing approximately 5.5 million shares.
As previously mentioned, TBV per share increased $3 to $40.25, and since 2013 has grown 4.3 times faster than
the peer group. We believe our business diversification, excellent asset quality and ability to generate solid
operating leverage will continue in the softer economy and validate our franchise as a high-performing, all-
weather growth bank.
Back to Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. I was pleased with the management team's ability to adapt to the changing interest rate and
economic environment to produce record operating results in 2022. Our thoughtful balance sheet growth, in
conjunction with executional focus, positioned the bank to capitalize on net interest income sensitivity, while
simultaneously growing both sides of the balance sheet with industry-leading performance. Asset quality
remained solid and stable with no signs of elevated stress.
Looking forward, for the full year of 2023, we expect a continued careful balance sheet growth driven by our
diversified business model, with a flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest income. We expect
loans held for investment to grow between 10% and 15% and deposits to grow between 13% and 17%. Our
specialized deposit franchises generate funds for more economically agnostic and secularly strong sectors, with
often significant deposit growth opportunities in excess of loan growth.
We also expect improved interest expense on the marginal deposits raised, as we had fewer term deposits in
favor of our hit interest-bearing deposits. Net interest margin is expected to expand between 4% and 4.10%, as it
moves in concert with fed fund actions. Favorable earning asset repricing dynamics for the quarter will support
NIM even if the Fed pauses hikes this year.
Net interest income is expected to grow between 20% and 25% for the year in a rising rate environment and to
exceed growth in ECR-related deposit costs. Thus, the efficiency ratio for the year should remain in the low-40s,
as we will continue to invest in risk management, technology and new business lines to take advantage of the
attractive growth opportunities we see in front of us.
In aggregate, we expect pre-provision net revenue growth of 11% to 15%. Excellent asset quality should remain
intact, but we could return to more normalized losses if the economy enters into a recession. Our goal remains to
prudently bolster key capital ratios in line with macro environment, with a CET1 ratio of between 9.75% and 10%.
Our bank's industry-leading return on average tangible common equity produces significant organic capital of
approximately 45 basis points of CET1, net of dividends per quarter. This provides us with significant flexibility to
achieve our strategic objectives, grow capital ratios, on-balance-sheet growth or undertake other capital actions.
This time, Dale, Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the QA session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of
Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. No way I caught all that guide, Ken, but I did hear the NIM guide. I think you
said 4% to 4.1%. I'm assuming that's for the year. Can you just give us sort of the progression, how you see it
trending throughout the year and exiting the year, and what fed forecast are you guys assuming? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, on the fed forecast, we actually have only one rate increase at the beginning of the year, that's in about a
week from now, for 25 basis points on the upside. We also have two rate decreases both 25 basis points placed
into our Q4 forecast. We're probably less confident about those rate declines, but we think it's a good, prudent
thing to do in order to manage our efficiency ratio and not have expenses run ahead of potential revenue
increases. So, that's the rate forecast. On NIM, we expect it to grow slowly through the year between 4% and
4.10%. It's pretty tight for us. So, probably crosses over 4% a little more towards the end of Q1 into Q2, and then
just grows generally from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And within that deposit growth guide, which I think you said 13% to 17%, any sense – I'm assuming there's
a lot of negative mixed shift baked into that, but any sense of where DDA as a percentage of total deposits can
settle versus that – I think we're low-40s today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'll sort of let Dale answer that second half of the question. But deposit rises between 13% and 17%. That's $7
billion to $9 billion, right. And just to be clear, what we're trying to do is grow deposits at a rate faster than loan
growth, and that's what we mentioned on Q3.
In terms of growth areas for us, in terms of businesses that may give you some confidence around the deposits,
our HOA business in 2022 grew $1.3 billion and we kind of see that still being the same. We also see growth
coming from our settlement services and our business escrow services lines of business, and those we invested
in, in 2018 and 2019 with a stronger rollout as we got into 2020. And those businesses did rather well. Certainly,
settlement services did rather well in 2022. And then, the rest is in terms of deposit growth will come from the
regions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. As you know, Casey, it's pretty difficult in today's environment to garner new noninterest bearing deposit
relationships. But as we indicated, we have seen a recovery of approximately half of the DDA declines in the
fourth quarter, primarily related to mortgage banking operations and the seasonal trough is 4Q. So, I'm going to

stick with that, that we think we can all – about half of what came down in the fourth quarter. But, again, what
we're focused on from here is how do we – sustaining our deposit growth trajectory, and then putting on loans that
have plus 300 or more spread between them, and that can drive net interest income kind of regardless of what
the fed does.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just kind of tying this all together, you guys talked about the 9.80% number this year you got
there. The Street has you at 10.75% for 2023. Do you feel like – I can input all the components and work it
through, but I'm just wondering, do you feel like that 10.75% is doable with this guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, Casey, what I'd say is our PPNR guide is between 11% and 15%. And from there, you have to take a
viewpoint on what you think's going to happen in the economy in terms of determining the provision. So, the
provision will naturally grow because of balance sheet growth.
We're not seeing any cracks in asset quality. It looks pretty good. But listening to a number of the talking heads,
many people think towards the back half of 2023, we'll see some weakening in asset quality. Again, we haven't
seen any of that. So, you're going to need to make your own assumptions regarding charge-offs on top of
provisioning. But the PPNR guide is between 11% and 15% the next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And last one for me. Just the loan deposit growth, is that average or period-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, we factor by kind of both of those numbers. But from here, I expect this to recover about half of the DDA
decline in the fourth quarter by period end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Hey. Good afternoon. Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate all the color around guidance.
Maybe I wanted to maybe delve into credit a little bit more. Dale, you gave a lot of color, but just kind of curious,
with everything that's going on, all the uncertainty, just can you talk a little bit more about what were the drivers of
the $3 million provision this quarter?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
I understand that a lot of movement within the risk-weighted assets. You didn't have a lot of loan growth. But it
would just seem that most outlooks have worsened in the $3 million provision. It might seem a little light maybe
relative to the environment, but just wanted to get some more color there, particularly maybe as it relates to 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, let's start with, if you work backwards from the $3 million and add on to that the sale of the corporate finance
syndications which we sold, plus the fact that this is a quarter where we didn't grow and we took down our EFR
balances, when you kind of reverse engineer it, we would have been closer to what we've posted in previous
quarters. So, the $3 million really represents none of those actions. Dale, do you want to talk about the CECL
stuff?

Yeah. So, we subscribed to kind of the Moody's kind of performance and that has, as we indicated, kind of
gradually deteriorated. Like I said, we're not seeing that. For us, the most significant variable is really what
happens on the commercial real estate metric. I think, for most banks, this probably has to do with unemployment.
And when you look at where they are projecting a decline on the consensus, and then we also consider S/4,
those levels are still kind of well above what our advanced rates are on commercial real estate transactions. And
so, while they pick up a little bit in terms of loss, it's not as dramatic as maybe some other institutions might
realize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And as you think about areas that you want to grow in 2023 in terms of the loan portfolio, would those be
areas in your mind? I mean, you mentioned, we need to grow in less risky areas. Maybe areas that have more
risk, would have maybe more variable rate loans. Just kind of curious how to think about the areas that you want
to grow in, vis-à-vis kind of how that might impact provisioning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I'll say our loan pipeline still remains active. I would see us growing a little more in note financing, build-to-
rent. Multi-family looks strong, as well as industrial. You'll see some pickup from construction loans that we did in
previous quarters that are beginning to fund up. And hotel financing will be active as we look going forward.
Specific, residential could be interesting. What we don't want to do is get in front of a fed action and kind of
decreased asset sensitivity until there's more clarity in terms of where rates are headed. But I do believe that
mortgage rates that begin with a 7% is probably going to be – 7% is going to work out over time.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody. I wanted to start on the deposit side. In terms of the deposit growth, the 13% to 17%, could you
talk more about how you see the mix evolving through the year? And particularly, I'm curious how much of the
growth do you plan on getting from ECR deposits, time deposits? It's obviously a fairly aggressive deposit growth
guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, like we said, I mean, in terms of actual kind of core noninterest-bearing DDA, if we can hold that flat, I
think that would be a win. And I think the large preponderance is going to be in interest-bearing money market
accounts. And those come in different varieties in terms of, spreads that we offer depending on the relationship
and whether there's credit tied to it as well.
I do think that the CD side is probably going to increase a bit more than it has, but probably to a lesser – at a
lower rate than what we've grown recently. And then interest-bearing checking is where I think is also going to be
kind of a strong growth area. Much of our HOA deposits kind of flows into that category at this point in time. So, at
the end, the DDA, I think you're going to see is still going to probably diminish as a proportion of total. The growth
there is going to be an ECR-related big chunk in the money market accounts and a little bit more in CDs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. So, Dale, if we follow that through, interest-bearing deposit costs were $197 million this quarter, where do
you see that moving to by 4Q 2023 in terms of what you need to get in terms of this NIM being stable to up a bit?
What are you assuming deposit cost rise through, interest-bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I mean, it really depends a bit on your rate forecast. But what we see is that interest-bearing deposit costs
right now, and if I could throw deposit costs in there from ECR, we grew – during the fourth quarter, net interest
income was up about $39 million. If I add the interest expense plus the ECR charges, gave up about three
quarters of that. I think that, that range is probably going to be more or less be intact. So I think we're going to
incrementally improve net interest income, including ECR debits against it, but at a diminished rate than what we
saw the past couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. When I look at where some of your peer regional banks have come out this quarter in terms of what they're
paying on deposits, many of them have barely budged on some of these categories. Curious what's the
conversation you have with prospects? And is this just a massive opportunity for you to bring over new
households, businesses? And do you see this as more of a consumer or business opportunity? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, we're a commercial bank, so we don't have much in the way of consumer deposits. And so, our deposits are
going to be floating at the marginal higher end of interest expense. But we focus on net interest income, and we

have the ability to take those deposits and put them in 100% beta loans, and, hence, make the spread on it. And
so, that's been in the conversation.
We're seeing larger clients move some of their money to us and having conversations about moving money to us.
We like that. And what's really a little bit different for us in terms of how we approach business, when we started
the change somewhere in the middle of Q3 of last year is, we used to lead with loans, and now, we lead with
deposit conversation. And we're very clear that there'll be no credit extended unless there's a very strong deposit
relationship. And that conversation has been well-received by our client base.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good morning. I guess, a few final questions. Maybe one, not sure if you already mentioned this, apologies.
Just on the expense outlook, as we think about core expenses. Just remind us in terms of the growth rate you're
thinking about as part of your PPNR guidance, and also, the one key seasonality that we should be thinking
about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sorry, I didn't hear that last point, what's the one thing we should be thinking about? I didn't hear that part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
The first quarter seasonality, like I'm assuming like first quarter historically is marked the high-water mark for the
efficiency. So, I'm just wondering if there should be a seasonal lift in expenses that we should be baking in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I'll take the second part of that first. The answer is, yes, our expenses tend to pop up a little bit more in
Q1. But overall, our efficiency ratio we're targeting is in the low-40s, which we've always targeted. And we have
one of the leading efficiency ratios in the industry. We kind of feel that, that's the right place to be. It allows us to
continue to make the appropriate investments in the bank on both risk management and technology, as we
continue to get bigger and bigger. But it also allows us to invest in new products and new businesses.
And for the last several years, we've been investing, as I said, in settlement services, in business escrow
services. We've got a new initiative we just recently launched in deposits that we're not ready yet to talk about, but
we built last year. That's off to a good, strong start. So, keeping the efficiency ratio in the low-40s allows us to
generate the operating leverage we want; also, invest money today for future performance.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And what does that imply just in terms of how we think about just the expense growth for the year? Is it
high-single digits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, it's going to be high-single digits, might be low-double. If you look at the kind of the PPNR element, $11
million to $15 million, holding the efficiency ratio basically flat as to where we are, could provide for a little more
room. But what we're going to do is we're watching this closely. I mean – and so, as things – we authorize FTE,
as we continue to demonstrate performance on growth of the balance sheet. We're going to have revenue feed
our expense expansion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I want to make sure we're not talking across each other. So, my commentary was on the adjusted efficiency ratio
without deposit cost, because Dale just talked about that, putting it towards net interest income. So, on the
adjusted efficiency ratio, without the rising deposit costs, that's what we think will be in the low-40s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Noted. And just – go ahead. Yeah. And I guess, maybe a separate question. Going back to credit, and I
understand the macro uncertainty, but when you look at your PPNR guidance that you've given, even assuming
provisions midyear 2020 would imply earnings at about $10.50.
I'm just wondering, is there anything around the loan book that causes that hesitation when you think about EPS
outlook for this year relative to your guidance? And obviously, you've expressed comfort with the asset quality of
the book. So, I'm just wondering why you – what would be the scenario in which that $10.50 EPS, plus or minus,
would not be achievable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, as you know, how CECL works, it really comes down to the end of the year and then the outlook into 2024.
So, if Moody's should turn more bearish as we put on loans, you're increasing your provision for the life of that
loan, not for the risk that's in the book. And so, that's why we've been a little bit more reticent on floating where we
think EPS numbers are, and then stay more on the PPNR side. Those are the things that we can control.
On asset quality, again, we're not seeing any issues at this moment. I would point you to a little bit the last two
slides in the presentation, where we think we've been able to grow loan growth in a very prudent way and keep
our charge-offs down. And I would remind you that 54% of the book is in either insured, or resilient, or resistant
categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And If I may, one just follow-up, when we think about the loan growth, 10% to 15% for this year, a lot of
macro uncertainty like should we be worried in terms of the quality of loans that you're putting on the balance

sheet right now at this point in the cycle, like what – or just from a client selection standpoint, is there a risk of
adverse selection?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. So, we're not going to grow for growth's sake, all right. So, the asset quality is still incredibly important, right?
In my opening comments, one of the things I want to get rid of is any connection to the GFC that – 2007, and
2008, and 2009, I want no connection to that and we are a completely different company. So, we want to grow
above trend; yet at the same time, we want to have above-trend asset quality or best-in-class asset quality. We're
working on doing both. So we're not going to sacrifice the asset quality for higher loan growth.
Having said that, after going through our reviews, we think the range that we gave of 10% to 15% allows us to
grow the loan book without growing into a recession and also protect or can remain with stable and strong asset
quality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We will pivot as necessary as new facts and situations emerge. I mean, we did this during the pandemic, one of
the few banks to sustain a growth trajectory during that point of time. And where do we go? We weren't sure how
– is it two years or is it four years to a vaccine? So, we need to capital call and when low LTV residential, never
lost a dime on either of those. And so, we're going to be nimble about using the flexibility of our business model to
sustain earnings performance improvement over time.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. I wanted to touch on loan yields. I know, Ken, you mentioned last quarter, and seeing the Loan Committee
turned down 31 loans initially and getting better pricing. So, wanted to get a sense of what the outlook was for
loan spreads going into this year, and if you're still getting the same reception from clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'll give you another story to that, too. So, our loan yields are holding in from that last conversation we had when
we did our Q3 earnings. Dale mentioned spreads are up about, on average, 50 basis points. And we're not getting
a lot of pushback on pricing. I don't have any numbers for you, but I can tell you, when we say no to a loan that
has good asset quality and good pricing, we usually are saying no because it's not generating the deposits that
we want to accompany that loan.
And what we're seeing is when we turn down those loans, those loans have been returning to the senior Loan
Committee, now with greater deposits. And so what we're encouraged about is that the pricing is holding, and our
determination to see more deposits accompany the loans has been following through from our Credit Committee.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as the risk-weighted asset optimization, is that process complete or there's
still some work to do going into this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Tim, why don't you take a shot at that one, because been running the process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. That is ongoing. It's definitely a part of our culture, so something that we'll continue to do.
There's definitely remaining benefit to be achieved through optimization. Some of that's in the targeted growth
portfolio mix, and some of it is structural with our clients, but ongoing improvements, still expected. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And then, just lastly, on the Mortgage Warehouse deposits, understand the seasonality in the fourth
quarter and this came back in this quarter-to-date. But should we expect a similar kind of magnitude as far as
seasonality in the fourth quarter by this year and going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, it's more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2022 than we've ever seen before. And I think some of the
reasons for that are – so we have some of our accounts relate to taxes and insurance and others are principal
insurance. So the accident insurance we expected a decline largely because of California property taxes are due
in 4Q.
The P&I payments tend to have much more interim month ebb and flow, but not so much kind of seasonal
elements. And that changed a bit this time. So, from our view, I think there were very few refinancings and almost
very few sales of residential real estate that took place in December. And so, as a result of that, when somebody
pays off – let's say somebody pays off the loan or refinance, say, the 5th of December, what will show up for us is
we'll get a deposit, including that principal of that loan, and that is remitted to one of the GSEs, two weeks later.
Well, that didn't happen. And so, I do think that you can make your own projection about what December of 2023
is going to look like. But the dirt of activity in the month of December, which I don't see a seasonal trough anyway,
but it was certainly more significant than usual, and that contributed to this. And that seems to be turning even
now, okay, early turn in terms of kind of the spring buying and selling season. I'm not sure.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Looking at the capital call loans, around $1.4 billion this quarter, is that the pace of run-off we
should expect out of the book over the next couple of quarters? And I know there are some associated CLNs
against the portfolio. I guess, do those securities remain in place as the capital call portfolio comes down, or
would the CLNs fall commensurate with the reference pull?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey. Tim Bruckner again. I'll take the first part of your question on the portfolio run-off. Answer is no, that's not to
be expected. That was driven by a handful of large transactions we elected to exit for return reasons. As we move
into the coming quarters, we won't see similar dollar amounts of run-off at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, we do have a CLN on the – I appreciate you remembering that – on the capital call and subscription lines.
That CLN, as opposed to the residential ones which are closed, so it's a specific pool of loans, and as those loans
pay off or whatever, that's done and the CLN runs down. This one is a – it has substitution ability, so it lasts for
three years. So, we have the ability to – when something comes out of that, we can put something else in it.
That CLN is a fraction of our total capital call and subscription line. So it doesn't really have much of an effect
there. It was really done for, as Tim indicated, for return purposes, not so much for capital management, because
we've already taken a portion of those down to 20% through that process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then, Dale, do you have what the MSR valuation change was this quarter? And then, any
thoughts on just run rate for mortgage servicing and then gain-on-sale income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We had no change in the valuation of the MSR in Q4. And so, what that means is that they hedging
basically very materially completely offset what was taking place in terms of market rate. So, there wasn't any
valuation adjustment that had happened. Kind of going forward, I think there may be – is going to be some MSR
dispositions that take place. And so, is that going to have an effect on the market? But at the same time, I think
there's a little more stability in terms of what people expect around refinance behavior. And so that could kind of
extend the lives and the confidence in terms of what those servicing rights are worth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I would add, as you look quarter-to-quarter, I would think about the total mortgage income being relatively flat to
Q4. I think that was your specific question. And while too early to call a trend, I would say that the first 20 or so
days into January, we are encouraged by margins rising in the business as that large money center bank, as does
the correspondent lending market. And so we've got our fingers crossed that, that continues to move forward. But
at this point – so that's positive, that's emerging opportunity, we think. But right now, I'd keep Q1's mortgage
income relatively flat to Q4's.

Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, got it. And then, if I could just sneak one in. On the last point, just the competitive dynamics in the
correspondent business. Perhaps that does create some tailwind to the gain-on-sale margin, but does the exit of
a larger competitor give you greater opportunities to grow the balance sheet at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, we're going to still manage the balance sheet relative to our capital CET1 goals of getting towards 9.75% to
10%. As you know, MSRs, if they grow in an outsized way versus our internal capital generation become punitive.
So, we will be sellers of MSRs throughout the year. And with that, we also hope, if we sell to non-banks that we
keep deposits that accompany with these MSRs, as well as possibly even providing MSR financing to the buyers.
And that was always our premise as when we bought AmeriHome.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Hey, Dale, the capital build in the quarter, I think the way I'm thinking about it, many thought you
would build capital, in some part you build reserve. I'm interested kind of in your dynamic, how you're thinking
about building one versus the other. And could you just remind us, 10% is the target, I think prior commentaries to
get there by mid-year. But with recent efforts and maybe some more, like any change in timeline there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. So, I mean, it really starts with the reserve. So, we look at our loans, our exposures and overlay that with
what Moody's says and our own interpretation of kind of, market and economic – market sentiment outlook. And
we derive GAAP compliance kind of seasonal numbers. And I realize that ratio is lower than some others in this
space.
And I think you don't have to look any further than our asset quality in terms of charge-off behavior and changes
in terms of kind of what's transpired there. I mean, we have – in the slide deck, we have kind of our segmentation
in terms of credit-protected, resistant, resilient and then the more sensitive piece. And that is just a small fraction.
One-eighth of our loan book is something that we think is going to have some, perhaps, volatility.
Another measure that that we look at is you take your ACL and divide that by annual charge-offs. And, I mean, we
had zero this year, but even if you took a couple of basis points on it and divide that into 60 basis points, you're
going to get 30 years of charge-offs. I know this is not – this is better than most years, but the average duration of
our loan book is only – under four.
So, all sorts of ways, we look at it, and we think our reserve works as is. So, now, it's about what do we talk about
in terms of what calls down to the bottom line in terms of tangible common equity. I wouldn't move up our timeline

at all. I think 60 basis points is a fairly significant move for one quarter. But we're going to do both. We're going to
grow capital, and we're going to grow our balance sheet at the same time, sustain an improving trajectory in terms
of net interest income and sustain our returns, while our capital continues to climb towards the high-9s later this
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Chris, to be very specific, I think you can look for us to be in that capital range of 9.75% to 10% towards the back
end of the year. We've got a real jump on Q4 by opportunistically selling some loans and then being able to move
quickly in the EFR space. That's our capital call and subscription lines. So, quite frankly, we're pretty proud that
we were able to move the capital 60 bps in one quarter. But I think you can look towards the back end of the year
for those numbers.

Hi there. Can you share the run rate for the ECR and then deposit costs as of 12/31, what that would be on kind
of a full-quarter basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I wouldn't say they materially changed from where we were for the quarterly number. So, it didn't grow quite as
much as maybe something I anticipated because the dollars came down in terms of ECR deposits. But I think that
we can track from the fourth quarter number, overlay what you think is going to happen in terms of the terms of
effluency actions and what you think's going to happen on the balance sheet in those particular categories. That
should work.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We showed you commissioned dollars.

David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Great.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We have in there with one of those baked in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And in terms of the Mortgage Warehouse deposit book, can you share the breakdown between noninterest
bearing and interest bearing there? Is it notably different from what the mix was for the bank as a whole, as of the
fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, most of the mortgage warehouse deposits are in DDA with an ECR, and that is the preponderance of all the
ECR dollars that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And lastly, in terms of the RWA benefit that you got from the reduction of Equity Fund
Resources, could you expand on that a little bit? I imagine that it might – it must not be zero-risk weighting, but
given the kind of the risk that those loans tend to have, it must be a pretty low risk weighting, I would have
thought.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
General construct of providing a credit-linked note is to provide protection, i.e., first loss taken by a third-party. So,
we get funds in, we shell our bonds with third party and they get that interest on that bond, less any losses that
arise from this reference pool. So, on the EFR loans, the subscription lines, they're normally 100% risk-weighted.
But because we've sold it on to a third-party, and they assume first loss, the first 12.5% of losses in that portfolio,
they pay – and actually we already have their money, so we control on how much they get back, because we'll
only pay them back less any losses incurred.
And because of that architecture, whereby you have moved the now kind of the structured product to a double
layer better category, it's basically treated as 20% risk-weighted assets. So, no matter what type asset you come
from, you end up at 20%. So, residential, you start at 50%, end at 20%; capital calling warehouse, you start at
100%, and you still end up at 20%.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Got it. So, without the ceiling, though, the risk-weighting is 100? Got it. It's good to know. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo. Please
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple follow-ups. With deposit growth expecting to exceed loan growth in 2023,
what's the excess funding going to be used for? Is it primary focused initially to pay down some of this near-term
borrowing, or is that excess funding going to be layered into the securities book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It could be either or, but our first goal would probably be to lower our borrowings and take down that cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then, again, following up on the large banks exiting the correspondents space, and thank you for
not mentioning the bank by name, but pretty large player in the space. What happens to that market share? Is
that market share kind of split amongst the rest of the constituents and are you expecting AmeriHome's portion to
grow or are you more or less kind of ring-fencing that and keeping the existing business as is, with kind of
competitors maybe getting more of that market share that's for grabs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I think, like some of the other competitors, they balance market share with gain-on-sale margin and that's
what we do. So, if we can hold our existing market share and grow the gain-on-sale margin, that works for us.
And that's sort of where we've been, and I think that's what the industry is trying to do. There seems to be a little
discipline going on here. But without mentioning that bank that left, it's early days. And we'll wait and see and we'll
clearly have more color on it as we get through the end of the first quarter.
During the third quarter, which is when margins dropped. We did a little experiment whereby we pulled back in
terms of activity and purchase volume. And we saw margins move up a little bit in that scenario. And I'm not sure
that's the reason why, but they basically stayed at a somewhat elevated place from how far they had fallen to in
the fourth quarter. So I don't know, we're encouraged by that, and we'll see what happens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Hello, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, question for you on the chart you have on the slide 18, the economically resilient portfolio positioning. That's
a mouthful, sorry. What do you expect that mix to look like in one to two years from now? I guess, another way is,
where's the emphasis in terms of your growth drivers from where we're starting today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hi. Tim Bruckner. I'll [audio gap] (01:05:19) you will see us focus growth, particularly through any potential or real
recession in areas that are resistant to recession. At the same time, you'll see us reduce our exposures in some
of the more sensitive areas. So, we'll do that more with precision than with a broader brush, but specifically,
getting – lowering exposure, getting out of industries that are particularly sensitive. And that, really, the resistant
areas, that's sticking to our knitting.
When we talk about growth there, we're talking about relationship growth. So, these are with sponsors that we
know, not just at the micro level, but at the top of the house. And we're growing specifically at low loan to value,
high amount of sponsor investment in the deal. What we're doing differently, though, right now, we can do – we
can be more selective, is we're being very selective about the submarkets as well that we're in if it's real estate
related. And that's where we're growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Got it. Dale, question for you. The PPNR growth of 11% to 15%. Maybe obvious, but what do you
see as the key risks, meaning what brings you closer to 11% or below 11%, and what could put you at the higher
end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I mean, first and foremost, we see our cash in front of us is sustaining deposit growth. With deposit growth,
we've got the balance sheet leveraged. We have opportunity in the asset side to deploy this at significant spreads,
which will drive NII, obviously, driving PPNR, which – and of course avoiding much in terms of the provision costs,
other than the higher values. So, I think, that's the number one thing, sustaining our deposit growth. And we've
got a number of initiatives, and some of them are coming to fruition, I think, now. And we think we're going to be
on track.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Tim, qualitative reserve size, any help you can give us on that? How big is the qualitative piece of your reserve?

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I can. It's – as far as the – you're talking about the qualitative adjustments on the ACL, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
About 5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, Ken, just one for you, how are you judged? How are you, guys, judged? Is it tangible book value
growth? Is it EPS? Is it credit? Where are you guys most focused in terms of the financial metrics that we look at
for the coming year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, as it relates to performance, it's sort of up and down, both the income statement and the balance sheet, as
determined by our short-term or STI compensation, EPS, loan growth, deposit growth, asset quality, operational
quality, and the growth in our capital base. In terms of the LTI, of course, it's share price. And the share price is
motivated by the growth in EPS. And so, those are the things that we focus on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Vecchione for closing remarks.
