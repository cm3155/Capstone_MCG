Q4 2019 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2020
Thank you, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call.
We appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance for the fourth quarter of 2019
and for the year. In the next few minutes, I'll touch on some of the year's highlights, and then turn the call over to
Heartland's President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will go into more detail on our performance. Then, Bryan
McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color on Heartland's results. Also joining us today on the call is
Drew Townsend, our EVP and Chief Credit Officer.
Well, I'm very pleased to report that we had another record year and finished the year with a strong fourth quarter.
I will be sharing with you a number of significant percentage increases in many of our financial performance
metrics.
So with that, fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $37.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted
common share. And for the full year of 2019, net income available to common shareholders was $149.1 million,
an increase of $32.2 million. That's 28% over 2018. And earnings per diluted common share was $4.14, an
increase of 18% over 2018.
Heartland's strong performance was supported by our net interest margin which, on a fully tax equivalent basis for
the quarter and year, were 3.9% and 4.04%, respectively. Return on average assets for the quarter and the year
were 1.17% and 1.24%, respectively. Return on average common equity for the quarter and the year were 9.56%
and 10.12%, respectively, and return on average tangible common equity for the quarter and year were 14.65%
and 15.73%, respectively.
Our book value and tangible book value per common share continued to increase during the year, ending the
year at $43 and $29.51, respectively, and that's a 12% and 15% increase over 12/31/2018. With respect to our
efficiency ratio, we've made progress over the past year, with the fourth quarter dropping to 60.69%, and the
efficiency ratio for the year dropped to 63.11%.
Moving on to the balance sheet, total assets increased during the year by $1.8 billion. That's a 16% increase,
ending the year at $13.2 billion. Our balance sheet is extremely liquid, with very little in non-core funding. Our
loan-to-deposit ratio is 76%, and our investment-to-asset ratio was 26%. Asset growth for 2019 was largely
attributed to the Bank of Blue Valley and Rockford Bank & Trust acquisitions.
Now that said, we had exceptional organic non-time deposit growth, and organic loan growth during the second
half of the year was exceptional. Bruce Lee will provide more detail on this in his comments.
Regarding M&A, expansion of our banking franchise through mergers and acquisitions remains a high priority for
Heartland. Looking at 2020, we continue to evaluate several attractive opportunities. We continue to be focused
on in-market acquisitions and remain committed to achieving our goal of $1 billion or more in assets in each state
where Heartland operates. Currently, seven of our 11 member banks have assets in excess of $1 billion. And for
2020, our goal is to have at least eight of our banks over $1 billion in assets. Building on our M&A experience,
Heartland is in a great position for additional accretive acquisitions.
Well, with respect to our dividend, I'm very pleased to report that last week, Heartland's board of directors
approved an 11% increase in our dividend to $0.20 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 28,
2020 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020.
In closing, I'm also pleased to note that Heartland has been recognized as a Forbes Best Bank for 2020. This
recognition marks the fifth time Heartland has been included on the Forbes Best Bank (sic) [Banks] list, which

ranks the 100 largest publicly traded banks and thrifts based on growth, credit quality, efficiency, and profitability.
Overall, Heartland was ranked 40th in the nation.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President and CEO, who will provide more overview of the
company's performance and strategic initiatives. Bruce?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon. As we head into 2020, Heartland Financial has never been a stronger
franchise or better positioned. As Lynn shared, 2019 was a record setting year. Heartland delivered significant
gains in earnings, earnings per share, and dividends paid to our shareholders.
I am pleased to report that we followed a strong third quarter of organic deposit and loan growth with momentum,
and Heartland teams delivered another strong quarter of organic growth. In addition to our strong financial
performance, we have made significant advancements in our strategic initiatives, including Operation Customer
Compass and implementation of the best-in-class technology platforms Salesforce and nCino. This afternoon, I
will share key highlights of our performance, and then I will turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Heartland's Chief
Financial Officer, who will provide more details on the financials.
Let me start by sharing a very strong quarter of organic loan growth exclusive of acquisition activities. Following
the third quarter's strong organic loan growth in our C&I and CRE portfolios of $163 million, we delivered $97
million of organic loan growth during the fourth quarter, and $293 million of organic loan growth for the year in our
C&I and CRE portfolios. This organic loan growth represents 6% annualized organic growth for the quarter, and
8% annualized organic growth in the second half of 2019. Our ag portfolio decreased $12 million for the quarter
and $27 million for the year. Our strong commercial growth came from a healthy mix of expansion of existing
relationships and winning against competitors.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 144 new commercial lending relationships. We have momentum and
strong pipelines, and we expect continued growth in these loan portfolios in 2020. Our residential and consumer
loan portfolios decreased $41 million on a combined basis for the quarter and $167 million for the full year,
primarily due to exiting the mortgage origination business in most of our markets and the current mortgage
refinancing environment.
Turning to deposits, we had a stellar year and a strong quarter of organic deposit growth. This quarter, non-time
organic deposit growth totaled $225 million, and we delivered an impressive $758 million in organic non-time
deposit growth in 2019. The quarter's growth was largely driven by retail, which included a year-end deposit of
$185 million from a longtime customer who sold their business. The entire amount of this deposit is not expected
to remain.
During the fourth quarter, we added more than 2,900 new consumer relationships. And in 2019, our targeted
consumer acquisition effort helped us increase the average balance in new consumer accounts to 19,000,
compared to 9,000 a year ago. We are enriching our retail customer experiences in branch via phone and in our
digital channels. During the fourth quarter, we completed the implementation of technology that enables instant
issue of debit cards in our banking centers. We upgraded our call center technology platform, and in addition to
providing stronger authentication, we are delivering more convenient self-service options.
Lastly, we continued to advance our digital capabilities, and we have added Apple Pay, Google Pay, and
Samsung Pay to our electronic payment capabilities. Our deposit mix remains enviable, with 32% in noninterest-

bearing accounts and 89% in non-time account balances. We continue to focus on deposit pricing and have
realized quarter-over-quarter savings of 14 basis points. We will continue to be proactive, and we will be
disciplined yet competitive in our deposit pricing.
Turning to key credit metrics, I am pleased to report that we continue to see stable credit quality. Our
nonperforming loans represented 96 basis points of total loans at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 91
basis points at the end of the third quarter. Overall, nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets were 66
basis points at the end of the fourth quarter. Other real estate representing $6.9 million of the $87.6 million of total
nonperforming assets. The fourth quarter 30 to 89-day delinquency ratio was similar to prior quarters at 33 basis
points.
Non-pass rated loans improved to 6.6% from 7% last quarter. Net loan charge-offs for the quarter were $730,000,
or 4 basis points. This is our best performance in the past several quarters. And lastly, representing a greater than
50% improvement from 2018 net charge-offs were 11 basis points for the full year 2019.
Next, I would like to share the significant progress we've made across our strategic initiatives. As we have
discussed on previous calls, beginning in 2018, we initiated and completed several streamlining activities across
the company, from which we realized over $24 million of gains in 2019. In addition, as you have also heard on
previous calls, we have reinvested over half, or about $14 million of those gains, into a company-wide initiative
called Operation Customer Compass.
Operation Customer Compass is focused on improving our people, processes, and technology. The combination
of these activities has enhanced our profitability, improved our efficiency, and ultimately, provides superior
customer experiences. These initiatives, which began about 18 months ago, are now delivering significant
operating leverage, as evidenced by salary and benefit expenses have consistently been in the $49 million to $50
million range for the past eight quarters. In 2019, they were up just 2%. Second, during this timeframe, our full-
time equivalent employee count has declined by 308, or 14%, from a high of 2,216 in the second quarter of 2018,
to 1,908 at the end of 2019. And third, occupancy and FF&E expense has consistently been in the $9 million to
$10 million per quarter range over the last eight quarters, and was essentially flat for full year 2019.
All of this was achieved in the same timeframe that we completed three acquisitions, we grew assets by $3.2
billion, or 31%, we improved our efficiency ratio 435 basis points from 65.04% back in Q2 2018 to 60.69% this
quarter, and we accelerated organic deposit and loan growth as evidenced by the strong performance in the
second half of 2019. We have built momentum and operating leverage, and we'll continue to deliver strong
organic growth and improve our efficiency ratio. We expect our efficiency ratio to move below 60% in 2020.
Next I would like to give you an update on our initiatives to implement the best-in-class Salesforce and nCino
technology platforms. These new tools will significantly improve our ability to deliver exceptional customer
experiences. They will enhance the sales process and improve the efficiency of our commercial sales teams,
improve back office functions, and shorten sales cycles. Earlier this month, we successfully launched these new
tools in two banks and will roll them out to the rest of the organization by mid-2020. We believe these significant
investments in technology, combined with our outstanding teams and our organic and acquired growth strategy,
position us better than ever before to excel.
Before I turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, I would like to share that on November 30, Illinois Bank & Trust
completed the acquisition of the assets of Rockford Bank & Trust. Next week, we will complete the systems
conversion, and Jeff Hultman and Tom Budd will take the helm of Heartland's [ph] Seventh Bank (00:17:43) to
exceed $1 billion in assets and control the number one market share in the Rockford MSA.

Lastly, I would like to welcome Dan Stevens, Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer; and Jay Kim,
Executive Vice President and General Counsel, to the Heartland executive leadership team. These additions to
the Heartland leadership team are a continuation of a multiyear comprehensive succession plan.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan McKeag for more detail on our quarter and year-end financial results.

Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll start my comments today by referencing the press release, which shows
our reported earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter. For the quarter, non-core items consisted of a net write-off –
write-down of assets totaling $1.5 million, M&A-related costs of $625,000, and a reversal of loan servicing rights
valuation expense of $668,000. Earnings were solid again this quarter, and financial trends and metrics were
positive in almost all aspects, starting with the strong and liquid balance sheet, which grew $640 million this
quarter, and includes organic loan and deposit growth Bruce discussed in his comments, and of course the
completed acquisition of Rockford Bank and Trust.
As a result, total assets ended the quarter at approximately $13.2 billion, with a tangible common equity ratio of
just over 8.5%, and a loan-to-deposit ratio of 76%. Investments grew $298 million this quarter and comprised 28%
of assets, with a tax equivalent yield of 3.03%, a duration of just under six years, and generate over $35 million of
cash flow per month. When combined with total borrowings of only $458 million, or 3.5% of assets, Heartland's
capital, liquidity, and leverage positions all remain in great shape and provide great flexibility to pursue growth
strategies and opportunities going forward.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased 1 basis point for the quarter to 0.84%. As
mentioned in previous quarters, we have $1.8 billion of loans from recent acquisitions that are covered by
valuation and PCI reserves, totaling $47 million or 2.6%. Excluding these loans from total loans would result in an
allowance-to-loans ratio of 1.06%.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $112.7 million this quarter, up $1.4 million compared
to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by strong non-time deposit growth, together with lower
deposit costs. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.9%, which was at the lower
end of the 3.9% to 3.95% range we indicated last quarter.
The decline of 12 basis points from last quarter is primarily due to lower loan yields, which included lower
purchase accounting accretion, offset by higher investment portfolio yields and lower interest costs on deposits,
which decreased 14 basis points compared to last quarter. This quarter, the net interest margin includes 17 basis
points of purchase accounting accretion, compared to 23 basis points in the prior quarter. The provision for loan
losses was $4.9 million this quarter, down slightly from last quarter's provision of $5.2 million, and was at the top
end of the expected normal range of $3 million to $5 million.
Noninterest income totaled $28 million for the past quarter, down $1.4 million from last quarter. Compared to last
quarter, the gain on sale of loans was down $1.3 million, and gain on sale of securities was down $1.5 million. We
also recorded, as I mentioned, a $668,000 reversal on the valuation of loan servicing rights, which reflect lower
prepayment speeds on our mortgages.
Moving to the noninterest expense, total noninterest expense was $93 million this quarter, or flat compared to last
quarter. This quarter, M&A and system conversion-related costs totaled $625,000, compared to $1.5 million last
6

quarter. Core run rate costs that exclude M&A costs, tax credit costs, and asset gains and losses were $87.6
million, compared to $88.3 million last quarter, or a $700,000 decrease. This level of core costs was slightly above
the $86 million to $87 million range we indicated last quarter.
More specifically, salary and benefits were flat compared to last quarter, as lower costs due to head count
reductions were offset by higher bonus and incentive accruals. Professional fees decreased $600,000, primarily
due to M&A-related costs in this category that were $300,000 lower than last quarter. Other noninterest expense
was down $500,000, with $400,000 related to lower M&A costs. The remaining categories in expenses were flat
compared to last quarter. The efficiency ratio improved 123 basis points this quarter to 60.69% from 61.92% last
quarter, reflecting improvements in both revenue and expenses.
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.99%, compared to 18.66% last quarter. The reduction was
primarily due to the release of $1.9 million of deferred tax valuation allowances for capital losses that were
realized for tax purposes on the exit from two historical rehab partnerships during the quarter. On a full-year
basis, the effective tax rate improved 43 basis points to 19% for 2019, compared to 19.43% for 2018.
Next, I'll summarize some of our thoughts for Heartland, excluding any additional acquisitions, as we enter into
2020. Commercial loan growth is projected to be in the mid-single digits on an annualized percentage basis. Ag
and consumer loans will likely remain flat, while residential mortgages are expected to continue to decline.
Non-time deposit growth is expected to be in the low to mid-single digits on an annualized basis. The net interest
margin on a tax equivalent basis is expected to begin to stabilize next quarter into the 3.85% to 3.9% range, and
then remain in the 3.8% to 3.85% range the rest of 2020. This assumes no rate moves by the Fed in 2020, and
includes the continued accretion of the remaining valuation reserves on the $1.8 billion of acquired loans post-
CECL. Provision for loan losses under CECL are expected to decline and should generally range from $2 million
to $4 million per quarter, with quarterly fluctuations reflecting the level of organic loan growth, and assumes that
both macroeconomic forecasts and credit quality remain stable in 2020.
Service charges and fee growth is expected to be in the upper single digits on an annualized basis from recent
post-Durbin levels, as continued strong growth in credit card revenue and growth in non-time deposits is expected
in 2020. Gain on sale of loans is expected to be slightly lower year-over-year on lower anticipated refinance
activity, and quarterly fluctuations will follow normal seasonal patterns. Core expenses are expected to increase
slightly over 2019, and should help drive the efficiency ratio into the 60% to 61% range for the full year 2020.
However, as you would expect, our Q1 2020 efficiency ratio will likely go into the 63% to 64% range due to fewer
business days in Q1 and various accrual resets that occur at the start of the New Year. The effective tax rate
excluding tax credit activities is expected to be in the 22% range.
Lastly, we have made significant progress on CECL and are nearing completion. However, we still have a few
items to complete in Q1 2020 to finalize our implementation. With that in mind, our current estimate of the
increase to the beginning allowance for credit losses from the implementation of CECL is in the 25% to 40%
range. The range reflects some remaining uncertainty regarding three items: first, fine-tuning of macroeconomic
forecasts; second, the impact of potential model validation refinements; and third and most significant, the impact
of the recently acquired Rockford Bank and Trust loan portfolio.
The two primary drivers of the increase relate to additions to additional allowances for unfunded lending
commitments, as CECL now requires an allowance for the expected utilization by borrowers over the life of those
commitments. And second and most significant is the establishment of an allowance for the $1.8 billion of
acquired loans which did not have any allowance under the previous accounting rules. We expect a relatively
7

modest net change to the current level of allowances on the remaining legacy loan portfolio. In addition, the
increased allowance will result in a reduction to beginning retained earnings, net of deferred tax, in the $10 million
to $18 million range, and will decrease the TCE ratio 8 to 14 basis points.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

Hi. Bryan, could you just walk us through a little bit more on that core run rate expense number? What exactly are
you backing out there to get down there? Does that include some of the asset write-downs that may have come to
that line? And then what was the – was there any sort of a tax adjustment or tax amortization expense in
operating costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So in the operating costs, I back out the M&A costs I referred to, the $625,000, back out the $1.5 million of
asset gains, and then see the third item is the – I think it's the tax cost of our credits, and that you can – we do
have that in our – I think it's a little over $3 million if you look in our reconciliation of the efficiency ratio, you can
find that number.

Those are the three items I back out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then I know it's kind of nitpicky just with classifieds basically being a little bit lower, but
just the rise in nonperformers, just kind of curious what drove that and what you guys are seeing in the agriculture
space right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew E. Townsend A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Sure. This is Drew. The first piece that impacted us a little bit here, Andrew, was we had $4 million slightly greater
in over 90 days that hit us right at the end of the year. I'm happy to report all of that has either been paid or
resolved down to a very minimal number. The second piece would be Rockford Bank & Trust. It wasn't a big
number, a little north of $3 million, I believe, in nonperformers. And then we did have two larger credits, agri-
related, in our Wisconsin Bank that totaled in excess of $7 million. So those were the three drivers. Again, as I
mentioned, the greater than 90 days have effectively been resolved already.
As it relates to ag, we were doing a little bit of discussion here. In 2019, 26% of our net charge-offs were ag-
related, and again by comparison, ag is about 7% of our total book. And another metric to focus on, 31% of our
NPAs right now are ag-oriented. So you can certainly see a disparity there. And the last comment I would make
is, as we have gone through the CECL process, we are seeing better expected commodity prices as we look
forward, and that's part of our economic forecast. But it remains a challenging space as we move into 2020.

Hey, Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q

Bryan, so the $87.6 million core in expenses, and in your prepared, I think you kind of veered that towards the
efficiency ratio on the guidance. But could you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
...any way you could range bound what happens to core, that $87.6 million on a quarterly run rate then?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, obviously looking out quarters, I think it's going to stay up just slightly for the year when we get our RBT
(sic) [RB&T] and everything else going, but it's not going to go up a lot. I think next quarter, it should stay plus or
minus where it was, I would say between $87 million and $88 million is probably a good range. We do have some
– then salaries start to go up and a couple of other things in the second quarter, but revenue should pick up then
as well. So that's why I think the efficiency ratio can improve as we go forward once we get out of the first quarter,
which is always kind of a challenge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And to that dynamic of – you led with the C&I, CRE in the, I guess, mid-single digits, is there something inside of
that if you look at a flat ag and consumer and down resi would be something inside of that for a net growth for the
full year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I think net growth is probably in that mid to lower single digits, but I would say mid probably because...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...we're very heavily commercial loan-oriented. So I think we still should be in that mid-single-digit area.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2020
Yeah. We think that the C&I and CRE should really be similar range that we were in the back half of 2019. And
again, we would expect consumer to be flat. Ag realistically probably is going to be down, as we continue to work
through credits and the industry. And the resi portfolio is really going to depend on what interest rates do, whether
we'll keep those on our books or they'll get refinanced out.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. And then last one, I just wanted to make sure I had the right number, Bryan. On the margin, if you add – I
think you've referenced – is that core number at 3.73% versus 3.79%? Is that aligned with the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, the 12 basis points were down; 6 of it was in the purchase accounting. So the other 6 was in core. Yes.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2020
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Bryan, if I could just start with a CECL question, does the credit mark on the – now I guess the PCD loans, does
any of that migrate into the ACL post-CECL, and is that captured at all in the outlook you discussed earlier on the
call?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. The reserve that we carry for PCI loans today will move over into the allowance. The other, we believe, will
be – will remain to be amortized as we've been doing historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And a question for Bruce, it's tough for us as outsiders to see the progress on Operation Customer
Compass. You talked about the 144 increase in new commercial relationships last quarter. And I guess could you
put that in perspective? Is that number higher than in prior quarters? And is any of that a reflection of Salesforce,
nCino, and what you're doing to strengthen and build out that platform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I would say the last two quarters have been very strong, and that 144 number would fit into that. For us,
anything north of 100 is pretty strong from a new relationship standpoint. And really what's driven that in the last
half of this year has not necessarily been Salesforce or nCino yet. It's really been the sales management process
that David Prince has put in place, as well as a much more targeted calling effort, as opposed to kind of a shotgun
approach. It's been very targeted in most of our markets and we're starting to see the benefit of that.
Where we will see the benefit longer term of Salesforce and nCino will give us, we think, an extra couple of basis
points, couple of percentages of growth, because we believe long term it will shorten the sales cycle about 20%,
which for us is four to five days. So that speed to market between the initial contact through underwriting, through
approval and through documentation, we think that timeframe will be shortened up with the new technology that
enables us to have a better 360-degree view of the customer and have more people working in the technology at
the same time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Perfect. And then I'll ask the M&A question. Could you just comment on level of conversations, pricing
expectations among some of the parties that you're talking with, and I guess thoughts in the first half of 2020 on
announcing another bank acquisition?

Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We're close to a couple deals. As you know, the multiples on the buyers' stock are what drive the prices,
and fortunate for us, we've been able to work with banks that we've had relationships for some time that would
like to be part of Heartland and our model, and they like our financial performance over time. So, yeah, I really
think you'll be happy as we go through the year with the announcements of new partners for Heartland.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mr. Damon DelMonte with CBW
(sic) [KBW]. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good afternoon, guys. How is it going today?
[indiscernible] (00:40:06)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good. Good to hear. So first question, if we could just circle back on the margin real quick. Bryan, I think you said
you're looking for 3.85% to 3.90% range here in the first quarter, and then down to the 3.80% to 3.85% as we
progress through 2020. How much of that is from lower accretable yield versus core compression?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would expect probably 50% of each if I were to – kind of that's what happened this last quarter I would say, that's
potentially what will happen. Purchase accounting, we can have a little bit more turnover in that portfolio. It can
bump up and then come back down. But I think what I've seen, and Butch and Bruce, you guys can jump in, but
when I looked at loan pricing, if I went back to mid-June, that loan pricing is down 40 to 50 basis points from
where it was half a year ago. But if you look at our deposit price, it's only down about 25.
So we've got to really work on the deposit side. And even if we do that, it's still going to be hard to maintain the
margin. So I think there's going to be a little bit of erosion there and probably a little bit on the purchase
14

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2020
accounting side as that naturally runs away, and we won't replace nearly as much on future acquisitions under
CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
There is an opportunity because we are so liquid, Damon, with the 75%, 76% loan-to-deposit ratio. If we can be
effective of generating more loans, I mean, we're still earning just a little under 3% in our bond portfolio on a fully
taxable equivalent basis. But if we can convert into loans, that will certainly help us hold margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And we'll have to be diligent, as Bryan said, on continuing to reduce our deposit cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then – and kind of along those lines with that liquidity, the securities portfolio did increase this quarter.
So can we expect it to not get much bigger than this, or would you look to put more leverage on it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, we wouldn't leverage to put anything in the investment book. The only way the investment would grow is if,
as Bruce – Butch said, we don't get the loan growth and we get the deposit growth. So, otherwise, I don't think
you'll see it get any bigger. It should come down as we're able to go the other way, hopefully.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think, Damon, that you'll see us put leverage on through the investment portfolio. Based upon what
we think our pipelines look like, as well as that one large deposit, which we don't believe that we'll maintain, we
should be able to increase our loan-to-deposit ratio over the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And the other thing, Damon, I would just tell you that we're thinking is, given where the investment portfolio yields
today, if we drive our deposit rates down and slow that deposit growth a bit if that happens, we may choose to
15


Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
(HTLF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2020
take on a little bit of leverage because we have so little, rather than sell off the investment portfolio and take gains
today to give up higher yielding assets. So, we kind of have to wait and see how it plays out. But we'd really rather
not put on a leverage and rather just grow the core customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's all I really had. Most of my other questions have been answered, so thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

Operator: Thank you. And speakers, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back
over to Mr. Fuller for closing comments.
