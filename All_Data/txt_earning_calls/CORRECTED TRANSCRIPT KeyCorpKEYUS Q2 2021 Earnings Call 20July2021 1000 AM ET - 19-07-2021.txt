MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this
conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Chris
Gorman. Please go ahead, sir.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.
On slide two, you will find our statement on forward looking disclosures and non-GAAP financial measures. It
covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I'm now
moving to slide 3. We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72. This is an increase of
18% from the first quarter, and up significantly from the year-ago period.
Our results reflect our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further
improvement in credit quality and contributions from targeted investments. We generated positive operating
leverage on a year-to-date basis, and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. We
generated record second quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in non-interest income.
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first six months, in every one
of our markets, and in every age group. Importantly, some of our strongest growth has come from younger clients

in the western part of our franchise. Our new client growth over the past six months, exceeds our growth in any
full-year period over the last decade. Additionally, our consumer business generated over $4 billion in loan
originations for the quarter. Mortgage originations reached another all-time high, and we expect to exceed last
year's record level of $8.3 billion for the full year. Laurel Road also had another strong quarter, despite the federal
student loan holiday.
Since the launch of our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, we have added over 2500 new doctors
and dentists. The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical
elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, healthcare and primacy.
Moving to our commercial businesses, we had another strong quarter. Our investment banking business
generated fees of $217 million, a record, second quarter level, and the second highest quarterly level in our
history. We experienced growth across the entire platform.
We have grown this business consistently over the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021.
Importantly, this is a business driven primarily by repeat clients. Our pipelines are currently at record levels,
supporting our strong growth outlook for the business. This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which
we retained approximately 20% on our balance sheet. Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related
incentives, and the investments we continue to make across our franchise in digital, in analytics, and in our
teammates.
Let me highlight just a few of these investments. I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our
National Digital Bank. Not only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us,
with approximately half of our new doctors and dentists, using multiple products.
We also continued to build out our analytic capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies. We
have doubled the size of our analytics team. Year-to-date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% in our
targeted growth areas. This has resulted in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis.
We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter, with an additional 14 planned for next quarter. These
consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments. Shifting the credit quality, our
trends remain positive this quarter. Non-performing loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from
the prior quarter, and net charge-offs to average loans were 9 basis points.
We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to
position the company to perform well, through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong capital
position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter
at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%.
Our strong capital position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, namely,
organic growth, dividends, and share repurchases. Combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this
quarter, we have returned capital representing $0.50 a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately
11% at our current valuation.
Earlier this month, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion,
beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The board will also
evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Overall, I was very pleased with the quarter, which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team. We grew
our top line, and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth. As always, we
remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management, and our commitment to return capital to our
shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases.
I will now turn the call over to Don, who will provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?

Thanks Chris. I'm now on slide five. As Chris said, it was a strong quarters with net income from continuing
operations of $0.72 per common share, up 18% from the prior quarter, and 4 times from the year-ago period. The
quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely driven by our
strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment.
Importantly, we generated record second quarter revenue, driven by strength in our fee-based businesses. Our
reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 22.3%, adjusting for the reserve release ROTCE
was 16% within our targeted range of 16% to 19%. I will cover the other items on the slide later in my
presentation.
Turning to slide 6. Total average loans were $101 billion, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. C&I
loans were down $9 billion, reflecting decreased utilization levels. Consumer loans were up 9% benefiting from
continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage
business. Combined, we had over $4 billion of originations this quarter, between our residential mortgage and
Laurel Road production. The investments we've made in these areas continue to drive results, and importantly, at
high quality loans and relationships.
Linked quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the commercial
utilization rates, partly offset by growth in PPP loans. Consumer loans grew 2%, again related to the continued
strength from our consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.
PPP average balances were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $7 billion in the first quarter. The PPP balances
ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion of forgiveness and $900 million of new production.
Continuing on to slide 7. Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up $16 billion or
13% compared to the year-ago period, and up 5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year-ago
comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government
stimulus. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits.
Total interest-bearing costs came down another 2 basis points from the first quarter, following a 3 basis point
decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting
for over 60% of our total deposit mix.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.023 billion for the second quarter of 2021
compared to $1.025 billion a year ago and $1.012 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was
2.52% for the second quarter compared to 2.76% from the same period last year and 2.61% for the prior quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our
balance sheet compared to the year-ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income, but
reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $11 million and the margin declined 9 basis points.
Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness were offset by lower earning
asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. For the quarter, PPP loan fees, including the impact of
forgiveness, totaled $50 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter.
The significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin. We are maintaining
around $20 billion in excess cash. Cumulatively, excess liquidity has negatively impacted our net interest margin
by about 35 basis points with 7 basis points of incremental impact for the second quarter.
Moving to slide 9. We've continued to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from
the investments we've made. Non-interest income was $750 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to
$692 million for the year-ago period and $738 million in the first quarter.
Compared to the year-ago period, non-interest income increased 8%. We had a record second quarter for
investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $217 million driven by broad-based growth across
the platform, including strong M&A fees.
Commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $32 million. Cards and payments income also increased $22
million related to broad-based growth across product categories, including debit, credit and merchant products.
This growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the
impact of MSR valuation changes. Lower operating lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year-
ago period.
Compared to the first quarter, non-interest income increased by $12 million. The largest driver of the quarterly
increase was the record second quarter and the second highest ever quarter for investment banking and debt
placement fees. Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage servicing income also showed
strength versus the prior quarter. These were partially offset by lower other income due to positive market-related
valuation adjustments in the prior period, offset by negative adjustments in the current quarter.
I'm now on slide 10. Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion compared to $1.013 billion last
year and $1.071 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect production-related incentives and the
investments we've made to drive future growth. We have highlighted some of the significant investments on the
lower left of this slide. We continue to invest in Laurel Road, including the launch of the National Digital Bank,
including spend in marketing and technology.
We also grew senior relationship bankers by 5% year-to-date in our targeted focus areas, including renewables
team that we added in May. We've also continued to invest in our digital capabilities as well as analytics. Our
analytics team has grown by 2.5 times, including our recent acquisition of AQN. The increase from the prior year
is primarily in personnel expense, related to higher production-related incentive compensation and an increase in
our stock price.
Employee benefit costs also increased $16 million, as health care-related costs were low in the second quarter of
last year. Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the
platform. Compared to the prior quarter, non-interest expense was relatively stable. Higher incentive and stock-

based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost. Marketing costs were up $5 million,
primarily related to the launch of the Laurel Road for Doctors.
I'm now on slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the second quarter, net
charge-offs were $22 million or 9 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit
of $222 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the
overall economy.
Non-performing loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $34
million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined and the over 90-day delinquencies improved
quarter-over-quarter.
Now on to slide 12, Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the second quarter with a
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us
with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our
shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital
priorities.
We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter. And our board of directors authorized a
second quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. As Chris mentioned, combined, this return of capital
represents $0.50 a share this quarter, an annualized return of 11% of our current valuation.
Earlier this month, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion
beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The board will also
evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.
On slide 13, we provide our updated full-year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the
remainder of the year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this
year.
Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas,
the impact of the PPP program and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year. We expect deposits to be
up high single-digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen to-date. We will continue to benefit
from our low-cost deposit base.
Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting a low rate environment as well as the
slightly lower-than-expected loan balances. Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess
liquidity on our balance sheet.
Non-interest income should be now up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based
growth in most of our core fee-based businesses, including what is expected to be another record year for our
investment banking business. Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect non-interest expense to be up
low single-digits, with the primary driver being higher production-related incentives.
As we identified on our expense slide, we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth,
namely teammates, technology and also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road. It does not change our
focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating
leverage for the year.

Moving to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance once again, which is now expected to be
in the 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio, our current
outlook and performance to-date. And our guidance for the GAAP tax rate has increased to 20% for the full year,
reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to
continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our
productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns.
Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all
of our shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with
Piper Sandler. Your line is open.

Hey. Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Just first question is on, sort of, C&I utilization and the outlook for improving trends in the second half. So,
definitely, understand the rationale for it, just curious, sort of, what's giving you that confidence? And, I guess,
maybe more specifically, are you seeing any pickup in utilization? Or did you see any throughout the course of the
second quarter? Just maybe any color there would be quite helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Scott. So as you think about, we always look at revolver utilization in the C&I space. And so typically for us,
it's been mid-30s for a long time. It would have peaked last year at 4.0% when people were drawing on their lines,
right and NIM has been a steady grind down to 2.7% where we are now.
Now the good news is that it has stabilized at 2.7%. And as we look at kind of some of the metrics, we think we've
stabilized at 2.7%. The other part of your question about what gives us comfort that we'll be able to have C&I
growth in the back half. And you're right, we're guiding the relatively stable loans throughout 2021. Our consumer
business will be the growth engine. But, kind of, the green shoot, so to speak, that we see in C&I are, sort of, as
7

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
follows: leasing, which we think is a leading indicator, our pipelines are up 35% year-over-year. And for us, Scott,
as you know, that's typically around renewables, technology and healthcare, which are some of our focus areas.
Other things that I think will help us is our focus on both technology and healthcare and also our subspecialties in
renewables and affordable housing. And then lastly, the only other thing I would add is our M&A pipeline is at
record levels, and that generally pulls through financings as well. That's kind of how we're thinking about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's perfect. And I definitely appreciate that. And then Don, I was hoping I could ask you about that, I
guess, it's on page 18 of the release, we've got the securities yields. Can you go into – and I apologize if I missed
it in your remarks, but just that pretty substantial increase in the securities available for sale yield. What's going on
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I would say that as far as the actual yield, I'm trying to go back to the page you're referring to, I apologize but –
yeah, sorry, it's more specifically, it's the 3.13 yield on securities available for sale versus like 1.76 in the first
quarter. We'll have to get back to you on that, Scott, because I would say that if we look at the total portfolio
overall that we would see a yield closer to the 2.30 range overall.
I would say that part of the first quarter of 2021 might be the impact of the short-term treasuries and would have
had a change there. But we'll follow up with you on that overall because if you look at the net interest income for
the first quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter, it's only changed by about $3 million. So we'll clarify that for
you, so I apologize.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. I just want to make sure there wasn't some accounting change or something that was obviously I
was aware of. So, -- all right, that's perfect.

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Can you remind us what kind of rate environment is necessary to achieve the long-term targets, particularly, the
efficiency and ROTCE targets that you guys have on the bottom of slide 13?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Well, we would believe that rates will help achieving each of those. I would say that just from the return on
tangible common equity that we had highlighted that we acknowledge that the reported isn't sustainable at a 22-
plus percent range. But if you back out the reserve release, that gets us to 16%. And even if you normalize the
current quarter for normalized credit cost of, say, $80 million to $90 million a quarter, we're in that 15% range. And
then if you adjust for our outsized capital position, that still brings us back close to that 16% kind of return on
tangible common equity level based on the current year's performance. And so as far as the efficiency ratio, we
are down to the 59.9%.
We also have some unusual activity in there related to certain government support programs, but those would
normalize, we'd be towards the 59% range and it would allow us to continue to make progress as we see
enhancements in our operating results to drive that down closer to that 54% to 56% range long-term.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's helpful. Thank you. And Chris and Don, can you expand on your Laurel Road comments? How far through
their medical school journey is a typical customer before they're acquired? What's the secret sauce that
differentiates Laurel Road from other lenders? And at the end of their medical school journey, what are the wealth
management opportunities? Just those types of – if you could just paint the picture for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, the typical point of capture for our customers at Laurel Road is when they begin their fellowships. So
think about somebody that is accredited that's a doctor, that is – wouldn't be unusual for them to have $200,000 of
debt and have a FICO score of like 770. And it's a great time for us to bring a new customer on to the platform
because typically they're being placed through the matching process.
And at that point, not only do they refinance their debt, but thankfully for us they do a lot of other things. A lot of
times, they buy their first house and get a mortgage. We also now have the ability to savings, payments, so we
can offer a digital-based kind of full relationship.

And what that does for us is not only does it enable us to capture these customers, it gets us out of the 15-state
footprint, because we can target these customers throughout the country. So far, we've targeted the 1.1 million
doctors and dentists. We'll build that out in concentric circles. The next build-out will be nurses that number about
4.4 million. Is that helpful?

I appreciate the color you gave on the commercial loan growth outlook. On the consumer side, can you maybe
elaborate a little bit more, maybe unpack the growth expectation as you look at the different portfolios? I know
you're constructive on the Laurel Road progress there. Maybe if you can help us size up the growth expectations
on balance sheet. And then separately, in terms of – on the mortgage side, I'm interested in what type of balance
sheet retention you expect coming out of your production there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, let me start with the mortgage and give you kind of a flavor for that. Our mortgage business, which
obviously has enjoyed a lot of growth, we generate about 55% on the purchase side, 45% is actually sold – I'm
10


KeyCorp
(KEY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
sorry, 55% is purchased, 45% is refinanced. 70% is on balance sheet. And interestingly, as it ties into the
discussion we were just having, about 20% of that is to doctors, just as a point.
So, we're expecting that business to continue to grow. As I said we originated $8.3 billion last year, and we will
exceed that this year. Laurel Road continues, and as I mentioned, in spite of the federal loan holiday, they
continue to generate good numbers. This quarter, they generated about $400 million of new loans, and we would
expect that to continue to grow as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then in terms of your excess liquidity, I know you're sitting at about $20
billion. If you could just maybe help us in terms of your thoughts on what options you have there as you look at
the bond portfolio, which is understandably tougher right now, as well as incremental swaps. If you could just talk
about the potential opportunity to redeploy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. You're right there, we're sitting at about $20 billion of cash. We also have about $5 billion worth of short-
dated treasuries in our bond portfolio as well. And so we do have plenty of excess liquidity. We would typically
target, say, between $1 billion and $2 billion of liquidity from that perspective. And so even if we turned around
and invest it in today's rate environment, it would be a meaningful lift.
In the second quarter, we bought about $2.2 billion worth of securities that had an average yield of 1.41. Today's
market environment would still have in that, say, 1.25-1.30 range for the same type of securities. And so if you
look at a $20 billion of excess liquidity and apply that, kind of, a yield to it, it would be a lift of over $200 million,
probably close to $250 million as far as the added revenues compared to where we would be today. And so that
is meaningful.
That being said, we're still looking for opportunities to when we start to invest. We've been more holding water as
far as replacing some of the runoff with new purchases. But we do expect rates over the next several quarters to
start picking up again and giving us some opportunities to buy there.
On the hedge or swap portfolio that you might have seen in the slide deck, that we actually terminated the swaps
that were maturing throughout 2021. And so the notional value of the swap book has actually declined. We're not
looking to add additional swaps there, but we'll continue to assess that and just assessing the overall asset
sensitivity.
Right now, we don't have a whole lot of downside risk, because if rates – even if they do go below zero, we have
a lot of floors in place in some of our commercial portfolios. And so we're protected on the downside. And so
we're again looking for more opportunities to start to deploy some of that excess cash.

Can you talk about the outlook for the cards and payments business between the core growth and maybe some
slowdown in the prepaid activity from the government stimulus and just the impact on the expense from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So you, kind of, have to bifurcate the two of them. We've seen strong growth, kind of, across the board in
cards and payments. The spend, both credit and debit is up about 25%, Peter, year-over-year.
Now, as it relates specifically to prepaid and keep in mind, our prepaid assumed that our revenues and expenses
about equal each other, we would expect prepaid to wind down, but we would still expect to see growth in cards
and payments based on the underlying growth of the other pieces and parts of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
And Peter, just to provide a little more clarity there as well that the prepaid revenues and expenses were both
about $37 million as far as the fee income and the expenses in the current quarter. And so, we would expect to
start seeing that wind down throughout the second half of the year.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Well, I would say there's a number of factors that are going to impact that. One is liquidity levels, and that's been
the biggest determinant as far as the overall margin. And this last quarter, we saw that 7-basis point of the 9-
basis-point decline was related to the impact of higher levels of liquidity. But our outlook would not assume that
liquidity position build from here. And so we shouldn't see that kind of pressure given the overall loan balances
and deposit outlook.
We'll also see some impact from PPP but as I mentioned earlier on the call that we had about $50 million in fee
income coming through from the PPP loan balances for forgiveness and other fee recognition. We would expect
to see that decline as well. And so we'd see some modest decline on the NIM from the core impact of lower rates
and PPP program, but should not see the same pressure for liquidity going forward.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Don, can you talk a little bit about credit quality in the sense that in the net charge-off number that was about 9
basis points. Were there any material recoveries that help drive that number down? And then second, when you
show your data on slide 21, it's obviously very strong and even stronger than first quarter of 2020 when the day
one – while the day one reserves were obviously established at the beginning at 2020.
But with the outlook for the economy, arguably being stronger today than it was on the day one number, what's
the likelihood that your reserves today, which I think about 160-some-odd basis points versus what they were in
the day one, I think, at 122 basis points of your reserve levels to loans coming down closer to the day one or
maybe even surpassing that number?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
All good question, Gerard. I would say as far as the recoveries, we did have recoveries of about $20 million that
were unusual. And even adjusting for that, our net charge-offs would have been 17 basis points for the quarter.
So still very low absent that on recovery.
If you look at the CECL reserves that we have that I think your math is pretty close to where we would see it as
well is that while the economic outlook is probably stronger on a relative basis as far as improvements from here.
I would say that if you look at the underlying nature of the portfolio, we still have a little bit higher level of criticized
classified loans today than what we did as of January 1 of last year. And so it would suggest that we should have
a higher level of reserve.
That being said, we've continued to increase our qualitative component to the reserve. And so if you look at the
qualitative component along with certain model overlays, it's about 25% of the total reserve. So it's higher than
what we would have expected in a CECL world to deploy. And it's just given some of the uncertainty as to how
things will continue to evolve from here, and could allow the opportunity to see some further reserve releases.
Now I don't want to set the expectation that we're going to have another $220 million negative provision expense
or reserve recapture in the near-term quarters, but we do expect to see that reserve level probably continue to
trend down from here to reflect the current status of our loan quality and the economic outlook that we're seeing in
front of us.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. And then maybe, Chris, you guys talked about the strength that you saw in the quarter in
investment banking. And you also pointed to that as a result of that, the production-related incentive expenses
were higher and you guided a little higher for the remainder of the year. Can you frame out for us? Because we've
heard this from a few of your peers about, production- related incentives as "being a good expense." What's the
relationship for the dollar of revenue that this expense represents? For every dollar of this expense, that you get
an incremental $1.5 of revenue. Is there any way of framing that out for us?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yes. And first of all, it's a great question, and it's one we look at all the time. Clearly, that business does have
operating leverage. You can think about half – about $0.50 on the dollar falling to the bottom line just as a rule of
thumb. It obviously depends if they are M&A revenues, if they're financing revenues, it's fairly complex.
The other thing that is in there, Gerard, that is part of the equation is we continue to invest heavily in new bankers.
And typically, new bankers, you have to pay a little bit of money upfront and we always think it takes about 18
months on our very intricate platform to be really, really productive. So part of what you're seeing is a lag that's
part of the hiring that we've done around in the business as well.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the pipeline on the Laurel Road side. Now how fast do you
expect the new digital bank to be able to ramp up? And how quickly could we see that layer into the production
levels as you go forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Ken. Well, thanks for the question. Just to give you, kind of, a starting point, right now, the nice thing about
that business is we already have a fair amount of critical mass. We've got about 46,000, we call them members
customers. And we have – since legal day one, we've funded about $5.3 billion. I think what you'll see and what
we're going to do as we go forward is to lay out sort of the path for growth for Laurel Road. But what you'll see is
we'll continue to capture a lot of clients, and we will see it being a material contributor to Key as we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And any updates in terms of the types of yields that you're seeing now in that marketplace? And does the new
business look any different than that in terms of what you can get on those loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I would say that when we look at the new originations, we're looking for something with a spread compared to the
cost of funds that we assigned to of about 240 basis points, which is up from when we originally started at about
220 a couple years ago. So, pricing has held up well and it's something that we'll continue to manage going
forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And last follow-up, Don, any update in terms of like the pacing of the indirect portfolio runoff and how
quickly you expect that to dissipate? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, we've got a little over $3.5 billion left of that. And I would say that it runs off somewhere close to $400
million to $500 million a quarter would be a general range.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line
is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. This is Janet Lee on for Steve. First of all, I would like to make sure that I understand your NIM
outlook correctly. I understand that there are many pieces and factors that come into play here. But are you
saying that the net interest margin looking out into the back half of 2021 may see some pressure, assuming you
deploy around $1 billion to $2 billion of cash into securities or assuming liquidity level stays sort of the same at
$20 billion? And also, should we expect loan and securities sales to grind down from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. A couple of things. One, what we've said is that most of the pressure we've seen in NIM has been because
of liquidity. And our outlook for the rest of the year would have liquidity levels, in other words the cash position,
remaining relatively stable from here. And so, shouldn't see that kind of pressure as far as overall impact from
liquidity.
I would say that the impact of rates – and we've shown on the current slide, other than liquidity, we had about 2
basis points of margin compression this quarter, and that was mainly because of lower rates. And then another
component that will impact us is the PPP forgiveness, which had elevated levels here in the second quarter, and
we'd expect to see that come down in the future quarters.
As far as the impact for both security purchases and also for fixed rate loans that, an example would be in the
second quarter, we had about $2.2 billion of runoff and it had an average rate on that of 2.26% and the average
purchase yield for the same $2.2 billion we bought during the quarter was 1.4%. So, about 80 basis points of
compression on that specific asset class.
We would also expect to see fixed rate loans, which isn't as large for us as it probably is for other peers, have
somewhere in that 60 to 80 basis points of compression there as well for the rollover of those assets as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. That's very helpful. On Laurel Road for Doctors, you commented about $5.3 billion of loans from
there. As it relates to 2Q growth, can you comment on how much of the $400 million in Laurel Road originations
volumes came from Laurel Road for Doctors and how much deposit growth did it contribute in the second
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I don't have the deposit numbers in front of me. I know that half of our new customers, which we said were 2,500,
were multiple product customers. But you should assume that the $400 million that we originated in the second
quarter relates to Laurel Road for Doctors.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Got it. And just last follow-up. On commercial mortgage servicing fees, can you talk about what led to a fairly
significant jump in the second quarter and whether this level is sustainable? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, that's a really interesting business for us, Janet. We are servicing and these are loans that are [ph]
RFAS (00:42:56) loans. We're servicing $500 billion worth of loans. $330 billion were the primary servicer. So
think about real estate, principal interest, taxes, insurance. The other $170 billion were the named special
servicer. So when things go into workout, we're basically the workout agent.
And as you can imagine, at this point in the cycle, there's a lot of activity. You might find it interesting that the
percentage of things that are in active special servicing, 72% of that, which is an active special servicing is in the
retail sector and another 13% is in lodging. So it's an episodic business. It's not a business that you can count on,
kind of, a straight line. But you can imagine at this point in the cycle, particularly, in areas like retail, that there's
going to continue to be a fair amount of activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
And just to follow up on that, too. As far as the linked quarter, that truly was activity-related fees that drove the
change. And if you look at the year ago for that line item, we did have some impairments that came through that
category. And so, the second quarter of 2020 was artificially low.

Hi. Good morning. Chris, in your opening comments, you mentioned record levels of new accounts or new
customers. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that. Is it on the commercial consumer side or just
across the firm? And then, which specific products are, kind of, drivers there? Is that line and deposits, or just a
little color on it because it was a pretty interesting stat?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A

Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. The comment I was making pertained to new households. And what I said is
that, we generated more new households in the first half of this year than we have in any complete year in the last
decade. So it was really focused exclusively on consumer and specifically, new household growth.
