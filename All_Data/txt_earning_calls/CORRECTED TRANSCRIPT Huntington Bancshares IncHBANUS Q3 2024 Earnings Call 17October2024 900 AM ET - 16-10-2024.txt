Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are very pleased to
report outstanding results for the third quarter, which Zach will detail later. 2024 continues to be a dynamic year
and our year-to-date results demonstrate Huntington's strength and consistent performance. These strong results
reflect the dedication of our nearly 20,000 colleagues across the bank who live our purpose every day as we
make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve.
Now on to slide 4. There are five key messages we want to share with you today. First, we are driving accelerated
loan growth along with sustained deposit growth. These results are supported by our core businesses, as well as
the successful execution of new initiatives, including expanded geographies and commercial banking verticals.
Second, we are actively executing our down beta playbook as the market enters a declining Fed rate cycle. We
are dynamically managing the balance sheet, and coupled with our growth outlook, we expect to deliver record
net interest income in 2025.
Third, we continue to drive fee revenues higher with sustained momentum across our three major focus areas:
payments, wealth management and capital markets. Fourth, our credit performance remained strong during the
quarter with stable net charge-offs as well as lower non-performing and criticized assets. This is a direct result of
our consistent, disciplined credit management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Finally, our
performance during the quarter sets the foundation for continued organic growth and increased profitability into
2025 and beyond.
I will move us on to slide 5 to recap our performance. We delivered accelerated loan growth in the quarter with
average balances growing by 3% from a year ago. End of period loans increased at a 6.3% annualized rate.
Average deposit growth continued at a robust pace, increasing by $8.3 billion or 5.6% over the past year. We
drove capital ratios higher again with adjusted Common Equity Tier 1 of 8.9%. This benefited both from capital
accretion from earnings as well as reduced AOCI.
Our fee revenue strategies are delivering with GAAP fee income increasing by 3% year-over-year. On an
adjusted basis, core fee revenues demonstrated robust growth, increasing by 12% from a year ago, driven by
payments, wealth management and capital markets. We are sustaining momentum in the growth of primary bank
customer relationships.
As we continue to acquire new customers across the footprint, consumer PBRs have increased by 2% and
business banking PBRs have increased by 4% year-over-year. We have delivered PBR growth consistently with
year-over-year increases for over a dozen consecutive quarters.
We have continued to invest across the company to drive sustained organic growth. Last month we were pleased
to announce our full franchise and branch expansion into the Carolinas. This builds upon the success of our
earlier investments in the commercial and regional banking teams over the past year. These markets represent
some of the most attractive geographies nationally, given their size and growth characteristics. We have hired
well-established colleagues with local expertise in these markets, and the results today are tracking much better
than our initial business case.
We've also invested substantially in our payments businesses, particularly in treasury management, including
bringing in-house our merchant acquiring capabilities. The merchant acquiring business completed its final testing
phase in September and implemented its full commercial launch in early October. The opportunity within
merchant is substantial, and when at scale, we expect it will add 1 percentage point to overall fee revenue growth.

Credit trends overall are holding up very well, supported by our long track record of disciplined client selection.
Our consumer portfolios are constructed around prime and super prime exposures. Within these portfolios,
consumer delinquency rates remained stable.
We are continuing to see sound fundamentals from our commercial customers. They've managed this rate cycle
and inflationary changes well with stable revenue and profitability trends. Overall, our customers continued to
show strength and resiliency, which supports a constructive outlook for sustained organic growth. We exited the
third quarter with robust production levels in September and with momentum that has carried into the fourth
quarter. As an example, our regional banking group posted record loan production ex-PPP in the third quarter.
Heading into the fourth quarter, late-stage commercial pipelines at quarter end are up 68% from a year ago.
Our teams are actively implementing our down beta action plans. Fee revenue growth was robust in the third
quarter and we have confidence in our many initiatives, including merchant acquiring as well as the outlook for
capital markets and advisory revenues, given strong pipelines as we enter the fourth quarter.
We are maintaining disciplined expense management while continuing to invest. The additional efficiency actions
we took in the third quarter will support our ability to sustain investment into revenue producing initiatives into
2025. Credit remains a hallmark of Huntington with stable charge-offs and improved non-performing and criticized
assets.
In closing, we have confidence in our ability to sustain our organic growth outlook as we finish the year and move
into 2025. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported
earnings per common share of $0.33. The quarter included $6 million of notable items on a net basis and did not
have an impact to earnings per share. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 16.2% for the
quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 16.3%.
Pre-provision net revenue or PPNR increased by 8.3% from the prior quarter. This was driven by net interest
income, which expanded by 2.9% and fee revenues, which increased by 6.5% from the prior quarter.
Average loan balances increased by $3.7 billion or 3.1% versus last year. Average deposits continued to grow,
increasing by $8.3 billion or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis.
Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 30 basis points. Allowance for credit losses decreased by 2
basis points and ended the quarter at 1.93%. Adjusted CET1 ended the quarter at 8.9% and increased roughly 30
basis points from last quarter. Supported by earnings as well as the recapture of AOCI from lower rates, tangible
book value per share has increased by 21.5% year-over-year.
Turning to slide 7. Consistent with our plan and prior guidance, year-over-year average loan growth is
accelerating. Q3 loan growth was 3.1% year-over- year, rising from last quarter's 1.7% growth and the 1.3% we
posted in Q1. Average loan balances increased sequentially by $1.1 billion. Excluding runoff from commercial real
estate, loans increased by $1.6 billion or 1.3%.

As Steve mentioned, end of period loans increased by 1.6% and represented a 6.3% annualized growth rate.
Loan growth in the quarter was supported by strong contributions from core businesses and from new initiatives.
Our new initiatives collectively represented $700 million of growth in the quarter and included Carolinas, Texas,
Fund Finance, Healthcare Asset-Based Lending and Native American Financial Services. Note, this pace of
growth was above the second quarter level as teams continued to ramp up and we expect growth in the fourth
quarter to be further above these levels.
Other drivers of loan growth in the third quarter included $595 million from consumer auto, $268 million from
regional banking, $165 million from residential mortgage, $137 million from auto floor plan, $80 million from
RV/marine, $131 million from all other consumer categories on a net basis, and $109 million from all other
commercial categories on a net basis. This growth was partially offset by a seasonal decline in distribution
finance, which was lower by $747 million.
Generally, we see the third quarter as the seasonal low point in the year for this business, given inventory levels
across our mix of programs. We expect inventories to build into the fourth quarter and resulting balances to be
higher in the fourth quarter on average compared to the third quarter.
Turning to slide 8. As noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by
$2.9 billion or 1.9% in the third quarter. On a full quarter basis, total cost of deposits increased by 2 basis points in
the third quarter and interest-bearing deposit costs were flat for the quarter. Within the quarter, there were notable
declines in deposit costs. We saw total cost of deposits decline sequentially in both August and September, with
September costs lower by 7 basis points. This is a direct result of our proactive and disciplined execution of our
down beta action plans in advance of the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut in September and continuing into Q4.
These actions reflect our active balancing of deposit volumes and rate.
Given our robust deposit growth over the past year, we're in a strong position to optimize rates from here. We will
remain very dynamic in managing the business and our action plan as this interest rate environment evolves. Our
forecast is aligned with a forward curve which projects two additional 25 basis point rate cuts by year end and a
further five 25 basis point rate cuts in 2025.
As we noted in the past several quarters related to guidance on up beta, the performance and trajectory of down
beta will be a function of the actual and projected path of rates and importantly customer expectations for that
path. Based on the current rate outlook, we continue to project a cumulative down beta in the mid to high-30s by
the fourth quarter of 2025 and in the mid-40s range by the fourth quarter of 2026.
Turning to slide 9. Our cumulative deposit growth since early 2023 totaled 7.1%. This level continues to well
outpace the peer group. As a result, we've been able to decisively implement the down beta strategy to fund loan
growth with deposits and at the same time manage the loan-to-deposit ratio lower over the past year, which will
support the continued acceleration of lending.
On to slide 10. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $39 million or 2.9% to $1.364 billion. We
delivered sustained growth, off of the trough levels from the first quarter of this year, consistent with our guidance.
Net interest margin was 2.98% for the third quarter. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q2, we saw a decrease
of 1 basis point. This was due to spread, net of free funds, lower by 2 basis points; higher cash balances, driving
margin lower by 2 basis points; partially offset by lower drag from the hedging program, which improved by 3
basis points. We continue to project full year net interest income to be within our prior guidance range. The fourth
quarter level is expected to be flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis and then resume growth over the first half
5

of 2025 and accelerate in the second half. This is expected to result in record net interest income for 2025 based
on current rate curve expectations.
We continued to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing with loan yields expanding by 4 basis points from the prior
quarter. This occurred even as SOFR moved lower during the quarter. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and
develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both short-term rates
as well as the slope and belly of the curve. As I noted earlier, our working assumption includes two additional rate
cuts by year-end and a further five cuts in 2025, and underlies this net interest income outlook.
Turning to slide 11. Our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from
sustained deposit growth. We expect cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at
approximately 28% as the balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in treasuries
and expect to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range. We have
increased the average duration of new securities purchases from very short half year duration to slightly longer
two to three year durations, which is a component of our strategy to systematically reduce asset sensitivity over
the next several quarters.
Turning to slide 12. Over the course of the rate cycle, we've positioned the company to benefit from asset
sensitivity as the rate environment moved higher and are now reducing our level of asset sensitivity as market
expectations are increasingly weighted toward a down rate path. That strategy has worked well to maximize the
benefit from the rate cycle and protect capital while managing NIM within a tight corridor.
On the bottom of the slide, there is an illustration of the asset sensitivity path over the next several quarters. In
Q3, we lowered our asset sensitivity by more than one-third from the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect
the total cumulative reduction in asset sensitivity from Q2 to be greater than 50% by year-end 2024 and moving to
above 60% by mid-2025. As always, we will continue to dynamically manage our hedging program to achieve our
objectives of capital protection and NIM stabilization.
Moving on to slide 13. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $32 million to $523 million for
the third quarter. Adjusting for the impacts of CRT transactions and the pay-fixed swaptions mark-to-market from
the prior year, fee revenues increased by $55 million or 12% on a core underlying basis.
Moving on to slide 14. Our strategy to increase the penetration and usage of value-added fee services is building
on momentum we have created over the last several years. Adjusted fee revenues as a percentage of total
revenues have increased from 25% a year ago to 28% in Q3. This reflects the focused effort on key initiatives
across payments, wealth management and capital markets.
Within payments, revenues have increased by $4 million in the third quarter and have increased by $6 million
year-over-year. Commercial payments revenues, including treasury management fees, have grown strongly,
increasing by 8% from the prior year. Debit card revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, reflecting performance
higher than industry averages, yet clearly impacted by the relatively slower levels of consumer spending growth
we are seeing economy wide. Other card-based revenues continued to grow year-over-year, supported by
consumer credit card spending trends.
The addition of merchant acquiring in-house capabilities will further support our overall payments revenue growth
as we enter the fourth quarter and carry into 2025. As Steve noted earlier, we see this initiative adding
approximately 1 percentage point to overall fee revenue growth next year.

Within wealth management, revenue growth was outstanding, increasing 18% from the prior year. Advisory
relationships have increased by 7% year-over-year and assets under management have increased 22% on a
year-over-year basis. These results benefited from sustained positive net asset flows. Within capital markets, we
saw exceptionally strong revenue growth, increasing by $26 million or 50% from the prior year to $78 million.
These results were driven by commercial banking-related capital markets revenues, which are accelerating, as
we have previously guided, as a result of higher commercial loan production.
As we look out into Q4, we expect to post another quarter of sequential growth in capital markets, driven by
continued underlying core banking-related services and a robust advisory pipeline. We expect this positive
momentum to carry into 2025.
Moving on to slide 15 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense increased by $13 million and underlying core
expenses also increased by $13 million. During the quarter, we incurred $13 million of expenses related to
efficiency programs, which will benefit our 2025 expense outlook and allow us to reinvest savings into key
revenue producing initiatives. Additionally, this was partially offset by a $7 million benefit from the FDIC special
assessment.
Net, notable items for the quarter totaled $6 million. Excluding these items, core expenses came in slightly better
than our expectations for the quarter at $1.124 billion. The increase in core expenses quarter-over-quarter was
primarily driven by personnel expenses due to higher salaries and benefit costs. We also saw $3 million of higher
expenses related to merchant acquiring as we brought that business in-house and launched our services in
October. We continue to forecast approximately 4.5% core expense growth for the full year.
Slide 16 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.4%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio,
inclusive of AOCI, was 8.9% and has grown 90 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy
remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth.
We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%.
On slide 17, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were
30 basis points in Q3, relatively stable over the past four quarters. Allowance for credit losses at 1.93% declined
by 2 basis points from the prior quarter and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook as well as an
increased loan portfolio.
On slide 18, the criticized asset ratio decreased by 9% from the prior quarter to 4.09%. The non-performing asset
ratio declined by 1 basis point to 62 basis points.
Turning to slide 19. Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged from our prior guidance. Our expectations for
the fourth quarter include accelerating loan growth at approximately 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. Deposit
growth is expected to increase between 4% and 5% on a year-over-year basis. We see full year net interest
income unchanged from our prior guidance range. The fourth quarter level is expected to be flat to up 1% on a
year-over-year basis and then resume growth in the first half of 2025 and accelerating in the second half. Core
fee revenues, adjusted for the swaptions and CRT items, are expected to grow at approximately 8% to 9% year-
over-year in the fourth quarter.
Core expenses are well managed and tracking to our full year outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect growth of
approximately 3% year-over-year, subject to some variability, given revenue-driven compensation levels as well
as expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business, which brings with it direct offsetting fee

revenues. This is consistent with our previous commentary to exit the year at a low-single digit year-over-year
expense growth rate.
Credit is performing well, aligned with our expectations, and net charge- offs are projected to be relatively similar
to Q3. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is likely to be between 18% and 19%.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move over to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

Manan Gosalia Q

Good morning. So, the guidance for 4Q NII, I think, implies that NII should be flat to slightly down versus 3Q. Can
you talk about what's driving that? Is that just a timing difference between those floating rate asset yields coming
down and deposit costs coming down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that one. And the short answer to your question is yes. It's just a short
timing difference between the really powerful and very effective actions we've seen on reducing deposit costs,
which you saw some of the trends we've illustrated in the third quarter. Those will continue into the fourth quarter,
just not fully offsetting on a short-term basis the reductions in variable yields. I think we'll exit Q4 having a positive
run rate benefit from deposit costs relative to asset yields with the early part of the quarter, assuming again two
more rate cuts, which is our forecast here. We'll likely be a little lower quarter-to-quarter.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And can you share more color on the deposit growth there? It looks like you've continued to grow deposits
faster than loans this quarter. Is that mostly coming from new account growth? And I guess the question there is,
why not pay down some of the higher cost CDs to help NII and have deposits grow a little bit slower than loans,
given that you prefunded a lot of the loan growth in the first half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. A terrific question, Manan. That is effectively the plan. We're really pleased to see how much deposit
growth we've seen throughout the course of this year. Obviously, very significantly faster than the industry
average overall. And that really puts us in a pretty strong position now with having brought down loan-to-deposit
ratio and just given how strong that deposit gathering has been to now turn and drive down beta and begin to
decelerate deposit growth, even as loan growth is accelerating.
So if you look at the guidance we've given for deposits into the fourth quarter, I would expect the balances to be
relatively flat actually quarter-to-quarter even as they still grow year-on-year. And that's really an indication that
we're doing exactly what you just said: leveraging that position to really drive our funding costs lower.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Two things. One, I guess, Zach, just wanted to follow up. I think you mentioned NII, I guess you have the
guidance for fourth quarter. And then did you mean to say that the growth accelerated from the one – the 4Q
versus 3Q level as we think about first half 2025 and then get even faster through the course of 2025? If you
could just clarify that.
And with that, what's the sensitivity to rate cuts, right? We had very strong retail sales, to the markets actively
recalibrating what the Fed may or may not do. Just talk to us whether getting three to four cuts versus not getting
those cuts means much in terms of your NII outlook.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. Great question. We appreciate the attempt to unpack it and clarify a bit. So our general expectations
for NIM are to be a few basis points lower into the fourth quarter, really driven by what I was talking about for
Manan's question earlier, just a short timing impact before which – before accelerating beta starts to fully offset
and more than offset the variable – impacts on variable loans.
I will note as well that one of the major benefits we'll have to NIM here is our hedging program. And just for the
facts, we had around 12 basis points of hedge drag in the second quarter – sorry, in the third quarter. That's going
to reduce, if you look at the forward yield curve, down to 7 basis points in Q4 and flip over the course of 2025 to a
5 basis point benefit by the end of 2025. So beta accelerating and the hedge drag continually reducing and then
beginning to be a hedge benefit as you go throughout the course of next year really are the drivers of why we
expect to see sustained NIM expansion from the Q4 level into Q1, into Q2 and Q3, and then continuing on from
there. So expect to see a nice upward drift in NIM from the Q4 level throughout the course of 2025.
And when you couple that with the really robust loan growth we're driving, that'll be what drives NII higher over the
course of 2025. We expect, as I noted in my prepared remarks, record NII dollars in 2025 really driven by those
two factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And I guess...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And then just maybe I'll expand a bit on your question on sensitivities. So I think your point is very well noted. It's
a pretty dynamic environment here for sure. And while our underlying forecast assumes a couple more rate cuts
this quarter and then five into next year, you could very well not see those, as you noted.
I think in the short term for us, if you saw less rate cuts, you could see a even better NIM performance and even
better NII dollar performance. Of course, as you know well, what would also matter a lot is the reason why you're
not seeing those rate reductions and what that would imply about customer and market beliefs about where rates
are going. And so over the longer term, that would have uncertain impacts, but in the short-term it would be
universally positive for us to have less rate cuts.
If there is more, I think, again, it kind of matters why. I do think, for example, earlier this year when we saw market
expectations for rate reductions really accelerate a lot, that was very helpful to drive the actions around down
beta. And so you did see more rate reductions. While it might produce a little bit of short-term headwinds over the
longer term, it might actually be even better for down rate deposit pricing. And so, again, sort of a little uncertain
over the short – over the long term there if rates are even faster now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I guess just one thing, you talked earlier about traction in Carolinas, just how loan growth was
evolving. Talk to us in terms of deposit growth. You did hire sort of a big team on the mortgage side. We've seen
mortgage rates pull back. But either that team or just the overall deposit gathering strategy beyond promotional
rates, where do you see deposit growth coming from?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, what we've seen with deposit performance throughout the year is consumer has been really, really
strong. But over the course of the last several quarters, commercial now starting to really catch up. And I think
that's driven both by our core commercial business, but also by some of the new verticals and new markets. The
mortgage service vertical in particular has been doing really well, driving a couple billion dollars of incremental
deposits in the third quarter and kind of like we've noted before that, that could well continue growth in the longer
term here as well.
So it's – commercial is now beginning to accelerate. And I think as we have an outlook for 2025, I would expect –
we're generally expecting continued deposit growth with the mix being slightly more commercial than consumer
as we go into next year.

Couple – one clarification, I think. Maybe a simple question, but you're saying fourth quarter NII around $1.330
billion, $1.340 billion something like that. Am I reading that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We're expecting between $15 million to $25 million lower sequentially, Jon. That will be around flat to up 1% on a
year-over-year basis. Again, assuming not only the $50 million cut we just had, but another $225 million here in
the last few months of this year.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then kind of a simple question, funny question, but on slide
10, I kind of want to joke about the scaling of that. But the fourth quarter 2025 bar chart implies higher NII. Is there
– odd question, is there any scaling to that, Zach, or what kind of an acceleration do you expect in NII growth
throughout the year?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I'm expecting pretty steady NII dollar growth from Q1 to Q2, from Q2 to Q3 and continuing on, Jon. I think the kind
of the path of NIM and also we are starting now to get into a bit of overly level of precision at this point given all
the uncertainties with it. But generally speaking, I'm expecting to see nice sustained NIM expansion in Q1, Q2, Q3
and a bit topping out into Q4. But we'll see where the rate environment is at that point. And the dollars really being
pretty steady growth throughout the year as lending sustains at a fairly solid level is probably the best way to
answer to your question.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah. If I can squeeze one more in, I apologize for doing this. But the merchant
acquiring, you're saying 1% growth to overall fee revenues. Are you saying that could be a $200 million business?
Is that...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, a little bit off. We make roughly $25 million on a run rate annual basis for merchant acquiring in the old
outsourced model that we have. As we in-source that business, we're thinking next year is going to be – fill the
$50 million in terms of overall revenue, which is that's an extra $25 million, sort of about 1% of the overall fee
revenue base as you go into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Can you hear me?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes, we can hear you now. Go ahead. Yeah, we can hear you, Erika. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Apologies. Sorry about that. So, Zach, as you can imagine, everybody is asking about the blank box on 4Q
2025 for slide 10. So maybe I'll ask it this way. So consensus wants to fill that box that would imply 8% year-over-
year growth from your implied fourth quarter 2024. So I'm assuming that has loan growth and also the NIM
inflection. So, with that, with consensus filling that box in it, up 8% quarter- over-quarter, are they in the right
ballpark as we think about your loan growth momentum and the dynamics of your balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, I'm not going to give that level of guidance precision at this point of the year, Erika, as you know. We will
give guidance as we get into the early part of next year. But I don't think that's directionally wrong, frankly. I think
we're expecting to see NIMs rise throughout the course of 2025. I mentioned earlier, I see NIM above 3% in the
second half of next year. If you compare that to where we'll be this year, that will be a nice NIM expansion off of
our forecast for Q4. So that'll drive some year-over-year growth.
And then our current run rate on loan growth is around 6% on an annualized pace right now. And there's nothing
that indicates we will not be able to sustain that pace into next year. In fact, the fourth quarter looks outstanding in
terms of loan growth and the momentum we've got across the business. And so those are relatively good
underlying drivers to get to the number you're talking about without being overly declarative on guidance at this
point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, that's helpful. Thank you. And on the expense run rate, I think, Zach, what you and Steve have been talking
about in terms of investments, really showed through with regards to your 3% year-over-year, quarter-over-
quarter – sorry, year-over-year fourth quarter guide for fourth quarter relative to the run rate for this year. And
we're seeing it in the loan growth. As we think about next year, with the caveat that Huntington, under this
management team and board is constantly investing, should we expect more of a harvest year, so to speak, in
that perhaps that fourth quarter run rate year-over-year is more sustainable rather than the 5%, 5.5%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, great question. In the area of expenses, it's something that we're incredibly rigorously focused on. And this
year is playing out pretty much exactly like we expected. Hitting the roughly 4.5% year-over-year growth,
decelerating throughout the year, as you noted. And really, Erika, staying focused on the model we've got, driving
efficiencies in baseline expenses. You saw us take another series of actions in the third quarter, and those are
continuing on. It's a fairly continual process of driving our engineering to enable us to really drive the offensive

expense categories that are investment-related: technology development, marketing, additions of people to go
and drive some new great revenue producing initiatives.
The plan for 2025 is the same as we've had before: strive for positive operating leverage. I do expect, to look into
the point of your last question, have a pretty solid revenue growth trajectory. And so I don't intend to – we
collectively don't intend to be in harvest mode. We want to keep driving for growth, but certainly to drive very solid
improvement in positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio, and then just to sustain that as we go forward.

Operator: Our next questions are from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Question on fee revenues. Came in a decent amount better than you expected with the intra-
quarter guide. I assume a lot of that swing is the capital markets and maybe the loan sale. But just anything else
that surprised you that you'd want to call out? I mean, all the categories actually did pretty well. So, I guess, I'm
just wondering what was...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
...kind of better than what you thought a month ago. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, great question, Matt. And it was primarily capital markets that you noted in the basis of your question. We
were expecting to see a pretty solid Q3 for capital markets, but it beat our expectations even better than that.
Overall, really, really pleased with the execution, the sustained level of performance we're seeing in the three key
areas of focus. 12% year-over-year growth in fees is pretty outstanding from our perspective.
The outlook for Q4 is likewise pretty solid, particularly in capital markets. I think we'll see another really good
quarter of sequential growth in cap markets. Wealth continues to drive good underlying household acquisition and
net flows, and payments really chugging along here, particularly with the addition of merchant acquiring should be
a nice lift tailwind to growth.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then on the credit risk transfer, the CRTs, as you call it, now that you've got – you're approaching your
targeted capital level, even including AOCI and you've got all the funding and all those positives, is that something
that you're looking to do lots of going forward or unwind them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. On the plan to grow capital, we feel really good about how that's going. And as we've noted
a number of times, the primary and most significant driver of our plan to continue to drive capital higher is just
core organic earnings and strong return on capital.
We look at these CRT transactions as really tactical, as opportunistic. They're kind of a interesting innovation in
the marketplace for sure that offer great, low return on capital for certain asset classes. Just look back to the
transaction we did in the second quarter. We unlocked 17 basis points of capital for less than 3% cost of capital,
just $7 million plus transaction costs. So very, very efficient. So if it's possible, we'll be opportunistic in the future
around these, but they're really – we see them in that way, opportunistic, and the core is really the underlying
return on capital and organic earnings.

And then maybe shifting to credit, there was a big update May quarter from an auto peer and you saw a little bit of
a step up in [ph] EQ (00:42:15) this quarter. Can you address expected credit trends giving shifting auto values?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Sean, thanks for the questions. This is Zach. I'll take the first part and then Brendan will tack on for the
second part around [indiscernible] (00:42:27). So we're really pleased actually with what we're seeing in the auto
loan production area. Auto for us is a terrific asset to lean into at times like this. One of the general expectation for
rates is to be reducing. Nice fixed asset class, it's got about a two-year duration.
Remember, this is prime and super prime credit quality, so very solid underlying returns and also incredibly
efficient business for us. This is a 10% efficiency ratio business for us that it is very, very optimizable. We can put
in pricing in the market up Friday, see the impacts of it over the weekend, dial it back in again the next Tuesday
as we go into the next week. And so really, really optimizable and precision return calibration for us here. So we
like this one.
I think the production levels for the fourth quarter look to be around the same as the third quarter last year. So I
think we've hit a nice run rate at this point, and then we'll see where it goes out into the course of next year. But
for right now, nice fixed asset that we're getting very significant fixed asset repricing benefits coming through into
the NIM. Brendan, over to you on credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan A. Lawlor A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Sean, this is Brendan. And given our history in this industry, we have the ability to utilize our custom
scorecard to really drive the customer selection that Zach was referencing, and that continues to be a strength for
us. We've seen late-stage legacy and charge-offs that remain right in our historical levels. So we're not seeing
broad deterioration at all here. And frankly, with our deep industry expertise, and with traditionally lower than the
peer set when it comes to charge-offs or delinquencies, and that trend continues this quarter. So we feel real
confident at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sean, we've been – this is Steve. We've been very disciplined. We got 15 years of quarterly track record here. It's
an area of continued focus and discipline as well as we've refined the model a number of times during the course
of the – that period of time. So we like what we're seeing. We're very confident in it. And obviously, with the
disciplines we have, super prime, prime, we're not going to see what you alluded to from another institution.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sean Sorahan Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Zach, shifting over to the hedge program slide, it's always helpful. I
noticed your receive fixed balance in the back half of 2025 came down a bit this quarter versus last. Can you
update us on any adjustments made there in the quarter and then maybe highlight any future adjustments here
you're thinking about? Thanks.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Yeah. Thanks for bringing that question up, Sean. So what we tried to illustrate in that slide is really the continued
dynamic management of asset sensitivity, really bringing down asset sensitivity a lot, both, I mean a third
reduction in sensitivity just in the third quarter alone gets a 50% reduction from Q2 by the end of this year and
then another 60% by the middle of next year.
And one of the things we tried to highlight all the time in this is we're very dynamic. So we're continually looking at
the most efficient way to really do those two objectives of protecting capital and maximizing and stabilizing NIM.
So we'll always make adjustments here as we deem it most efficient. An example of that, we just did another $1
billion of forward-starting receivers just in the early part of this quarter that are really starting out into the second
half of 2025. That'll just continue to drive asset sensitivity lower at the time we really want it.
So we're always doing this. Really, primarily at this point, the game plan vis-a-vis asset sensitivity is gradually
allow the pay-fixed swaptions to reduce, to expire, put on more forward-starting receivers when we see nice
opportunities in the market to do that, gradually lengthen the duration in our US treasury securities portfolio and
really optimize the funding mix for lower structurally fixed funding, more structurally variable funding and optimize
lower levels of that cash. And so those are really the components that drive the overall reduction in asset
sensitivity.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you for joining us today. In closing, we delivered exceptional results for the third quarter, highlighted by
successful execution of organic growth initiatives. Net interest income expanded, fee revenues grew strongly,
expenses were well managed and credit remained stable. Our strategy is working well and our investments in the
franchise are delivering returns. We remain in an attractive, competitive position and we continue to seize
opportunities to add talented bankers across our businesses.
Collectively, the board executives and our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder, so we have strong, strong
alignment to deliver sustained value creation for our shareholders.
As a reminder, we have an Investor Day scheduled in the new year on February 6, and you are invited to that.
And finally, thank you to all our Huntington colleagues for driving these outstanding results. Thank you very much
for joining us today. Have a great day.
