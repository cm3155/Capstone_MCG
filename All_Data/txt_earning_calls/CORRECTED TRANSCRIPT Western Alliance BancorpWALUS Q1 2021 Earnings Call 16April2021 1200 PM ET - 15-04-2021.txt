Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good afternoon, and welcome to Western Alliance first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are
Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer. I will first provide an
overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment.
And then Dale will walk you through the bank's financial performance. Afterwards, we'll open the line and we will
take your questions.
The continued growth in Western Alliance's national commercial business strategy drove financial results and
balance sheet growth to record quarterly highs to kick off 2021, mirroring the company's strong fourth quarter
performance and underlying fundamental trends. WAL earned net income of $192.5 million and earnings per
share of $1.90 for the quarter, $108 million year-over-year and nearly flat to Q4.
Net revenue expanded 4.5 times the rate of expenses as improvement in asset quality and economic conditions
drove $32.4 million release in the loan loss reserve this quarter. Our focus continues to be on PPNR growth,
which rose approximately 31% year-over-year to $202 million while marginally lower than last quarter due to two
fewer days.
Regarding the acquisition of AmeriHome, I am pleased that the closing took place approximately three weeks
ahead of schedule. While personnel and technology integrations are minimal, we have begun to focus on balance
sheets and funding synergies with the pay down of external credit lines.
Additionally, we signed agreements with the sale of approximately $750 million of mortgage servicing rights to
strong counterparties that will allow Western Alliance to retain substantially all the custodial deposits. We expect
this to be completed in early May. AmeriHome was an attractive strategic acquisition, expanding Western
Alliance's fee income and lowering the company's reliance on spread income while providing growth optionality to
our commercial portfolio of businesses.
Turning to the first quarter, balance sheet trends, outstanding quarterly loan and deposit growth of $1.7 billion and
$6.5 billion respectively, lifting total assets to $43.4 billion, up 49% from the prior year. Our near-term focus on
growing loans in low risk asset classes was on display as loan growth was primarily driven by warehouse funding,
residential loan purchases, and increased activities throughout our traditional banking and regional footprint.
Our deposit growth was broad based across our franchise which pushed down our loan-to-deposit ratio to 75%
and created a strong funding foundation for ongoing loan and earnings growth from our commercial loan pipeline
and the AmeriHome acquisition. The continued excess liquidity from our improving deposit franchise is at the
expense of short-term NIM compression, but it's a tradeoff we are willing to accept for long-term value creation.
This impressive loan growth drove net interest income to $317.3 million or $2.5 million higher than last quarter
and up 18% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly net interest margin was 3.37%, down 47% from the fourth
quarter as we continued to deploy excess liquidity into loans and investment securities. Non-interest income
totaled $19.7 million for the quarter, aided by $7.3 million of warrant income from Bridge Bank. Asset quality
remained stable this quarter as the economic recovery gained steam.
For the quarter, net loan charge offs were $1.4 million or 2 basis points on an annualized basis. Credit losses may
not appear in any meaningful way as prior and proposed stimulus packages continue to positively impact
consumer spending habits. And many businesses were provided the liquidity to weather the pandemic.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Finally, Western Alliance continues to generate significant excess capital, which accrued tangible book value per
share of $33.02 for 23.5% year-over-year growth. We remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with
a return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.93% and 24.2% respectively. This
strong momentum coupled with economic reopening positions Western Alliance well for an industry leading 2021.
At this time, I'll let Dale take you through the financial performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $192.5 million or $1.90 per share, each
down about 1% from the prior quarter. This is inclusive of reversal credit loss provisions of $32.4 million due to
continued improvement in economic forecast relative to year-end 2020 in continued loan segments with
historically very low loss rates.
Additionally, merger expenses related to the AmeriHome acquisition of $400,000 were recognized. We expect
total merger charges to be approximately $15 million, preponderance of which will be incurred in Q2 as integration
continues. Net interest income grew $2.5 million during the quarter to $317.3 million, an increase of 18% year-
over-year primarily as a result of our significant balance sheet growth. However, while average earning assets
grew $5.7 billion, the relative proportion held in cash and lower yielding securities increased to approximately 32%
in Q1 from 22% in Q4, which temporarily muted our interest income growth as we prepared to deploy excess
liquidity into AmeriHome generated assets and higher yielding commercial loans. Quarter-over-quarter, our loan
to deposit ratio fell to 75% from 85% in Q4 as we proactively look to grow low cost deposits as dry powder for
future loan growth.
Non-interest income fell $4.1 million to $19.7 million from the prior quarter, mainly driven by smaller fair value gain
adjustments in our securities measured at fair value, to partially offset by $7.3 million in warrant income. Non-
interest expense increased $2.8 million mainly due to higher deposit costs as lower rates were offset by higher
average balances. Continued balance sheet growth generating superior net interest income drove preprovision
net revenue of $202 million, up over 30% from a year ago.
Turning now to net interest drivers. As our strong core deposit growth continued throughout the quarter, we look
to redeploy excess liquidity into the investment portfolio and loans. Total investments grew $2.4 billion for the
quarter or 43% to $7.9 billion compared to an average balance of $6.5 billion. Investment yields declined 24 basis
points from the prior quarter to 2.37% due to lower reinvestment rates in the current environment.
Similarly on a linked-quarter basis, loan yields declined 8 basis points following ongoing mix shift toward
residential loans and asset class with generally lower yields in the remainder of the portfolio and low credit risk.
This was partially offset by modestly higher PPP fees, strong loan growth and liquidity deployment towards the
end of the quarter. Significantly, quarter end balances for loans and investments were $3.3 billion higher than the
average balances and yielded 3.5% more than our Fed account. Higher income from this already deployed
liquidity positions us well for Q2.
Interest-bearing deposit costs were reduced by 3 basis points in Q1 to 22 basis points due to ongoing repricing
efforts and maturities of higher cost CDs. The spot rate for total deposits which includes non-interest-bearing was
11 basis points. We expect funding costs had generally stabilized at these levels.
Net interest income increased $2.5 million to $317.3 million during the quarter, 18% year-over-year as higher loan
investment balances offset net interest margin compression. NIM declined 47 basis points to $337 million as our

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
purposeful strong deposit growth in advance of closing the AmeriHome acquisition negatively impacted the
margin by 43 basis points. To put this in perspective, average securities and cash balances, the interest-earning
assets increased meaningfully in Q1 to 32% from 22%. Given our higher end quarter loan balances, healthy loan
pipeline and ability to deploy this excess liquidity over the coming quarters into higher yielding earning assets, we
expect this margin drag to moderate, while net interest income climbs. Additionally, a PPP loan yield of 4.9%
benefited the NIM by 8 basis points which was similar to the fourth quarter benefit.
Cumulatively, over the remainder of 2021, we expect to recognize $15.4 million of PPP fees. Our efficiency ratio
rose 90 basis points to 39.1%, an increase from 38.2% in Q4. This higher efficiency ratio was driven by a modest
decline in non-interest income and an increase in expenses, partially offset by increased net interest income.
Non-interest expense linked-quarter growth increased by 2.1% driven by higher deposit fees related to the 82%
annualized rise in deposit balances. Excluding PPP net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for the quarter
would have been 41%. Inclusive of AmeriHome, we expect the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid-40s this quarter.
Pre-provision net revenue declined $4.4 million or 2.1% from the prior quarter, but increased 31% from the same
period last year. This results in PPNR ROA of 2.03% for the quarter, a decrease of 21 basis points compared to
2.24% for the year-ago period, partially impacted by a much larger asset base. This continued strong
performance in capital generation provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital
management actions or meet credit demands.
Balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $1.7 billion or 6.1% to $28.7 billion
and deposit growth of $6.5 billion brought balances to $38.4 billion at quarter-end. Inclusive of the second round
of PPP funding, loans grew 24% year-over-year, while deposits grew approximately 55% year-over-year with our
focus on low [ph] loss loan (00:13:40) segments and DDA. In all, total assets have grown 49% year-over-year as
we approach the $50 billion asset level, including AmeriHome.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $2.12 over the prior quarter to $33.02, an increase of $6.29 or
23.5% over the prior year, attributable to both net income and the common stock offering of 2.3 million shares
completed during Q1 in anticipation of the AmeriHome acquisition.
Our strong loan growth continues to benefit from flexible national commercial business strategy. The majority of
the $1.7 billion in growth was driven by an increase in C&I loans of $746 million. Loan growth was also strong in
residential real estate loans of $675 million, supplemented by construction loans of $337 million and CRE non-
owner occupied loans of $27 million. Residential and consumer loans now comprise 10.9% of our loan portfolio,
an increase from 9.9% a year ago.
Within the C&I growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on low-risk assets, mortgage warehouse loans
grew $562 million and Round 2 PPP loans originations were $560 million, which were nearly offset by $479
million from Round 1 of payoffs.
We continue to believe our ability to grow core deposits from diversified funding channels is our key to firm's long-
term value creation. Given the ability to deploy funds into attractive assets in the near term, we purposefully
looked to expand balance sheet liquidity in Q1. Deposits grew $6.5 billion or 20% in the first quarter driven by
increases in non-interest-bearing DDA of $4.1 billion, which now comprise 46% of our deposit base and savings
and money market of $2.9 billion.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Market share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be a significant drivers of deposit growth during the
quarter, along with robust activity in tech and innovation and seasonal inflows from HOA banking relationships
developed during 2020.
Our asset quality remained strong and borrowers are stable, liquid and supported by strong sponsors. Total
classified assets increased $57 million in Q1 to $281 million due to migration of a few borrowers in COVID-
impacted industries such as travel, leisure and entertainment as reopening continues, but at an uneven pace. We
see the potential for these credits to be upgraded as travel and events increase in the coming quarters.
Our non-performing loans plus OREO ratio declined 27 basis points to total assets and total classified assets rose
4 basis points to total assets to 0.65% compared to the ratio at the end of 2020.
Special mention loans increased $23 million during the quarter to 1.65% of funded loans. As we've discussed
before, SM loans are a result of our credit mitigation strategy to early identify, elevate, and apply heightened
monitoring to loans or segments impacted by the current COVID environment and fluctuate as credits migrate in
and out. We do not see credit losses emerging from special mention volatility.
Regarding loan deferrals, as of quarter-end, we had $68.5 million of deferrals, all of which are in low LTV
residential loans. Quarterly net credit losses were modest at $1.4 million or 2 basis points of average loans
compared to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter.
Our loan ACL fell $36 million from the prior quarter to $280 million due to improvement in macroeconomic
forecasts and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates. In all, total loan ACL to funded loans
declined 20 basis points to 97 basis points or 1.03% when excluding PPP loans. For comparison purposes, the
loan ACL to funded loans was 84 basis points at year-end 2019 before CECL adoption.
We continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory ratios. The tangible common equity to total assets
of 7.9% were down this quarter by strong asset growth and the common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, an increase
of 40 basis points during the quarter, mainly driven by our common stock offering and growth in low risk assets.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 a share, our tangible book value per share rose $2.12 in
the quarter to $33.2, an increase of 23% in the past year.
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken.

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. Western Alliance is one of only a handful of growth banks in the industry with double-digit loan
growth, liquidity to fund the growth, strong improving net interest income that generates consistent peer-leading
ROA and return on average tangible common equity, with steady asset quality and low net charge-offs.
Going forward, based on our current pipelines, we expect loan and deposit growth of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per
quarter, which will drive higher net interest income and PPNR growth. We expect NIM pressure to subside
through the deployment of liquidity into attractive asset classes. One of the characteristics of AmeriHome that we
found very attractive is that it provides a natural solution to WAL's excess liquidity. AmeriHome will be expanding
its product array to include higher yielding non-QM and jumbo loans that fit our established credit box. Placing
and holding these loans on our balance sheet enhances our existing residential mortgage purchase program and
is a worthy credit solution for the swift deployment of excess liquidity.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
To keep pace with balance sheet performance, our risk management programs and technology platforms are
evolving and expenses will rise, but will be offset by the revenue generated from excess liquidity deployment.
There will be no drag on PPNR or EPS of these investments.
Inclusive of AmeriHome, the efficiency ratio will rise to the mid-40s. Finally, our long-term asset quality and loan
loss reserves are informed by the economic consensus forecasts incorporating risk for tail economic events,
which, if consistent going forward, could imply a steady reserve balance. Depending on the timing and pace of the
recovery, there could be some loan migration into the special mention category, but we do not expect material
migration into sub-standard. We believe the provisions in excess of charge-offs since the pandemic began are
more than sufficient to cover charge-offs through the cycle as we do not see any indicators that imply material
losses are on the horizon.
To conclude, Western Alliance is well-positioned for balance sheet growth with steady asset quality. PPNR should
continue its upward trajectory from Q1 along with industry-leading return on assets and equity. At this time, Dale,
Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks very much. Dale, if you could review with the closing of AmeriHome, what does the debt paydown
picture look like and how is that going to shape your ability to kind of soak up this excess liquidity in the near
term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we're doing that now. They had about over a little over $3 billion worth of borrowings and we're phasing
those out kind of going forward. I think we're going to – I think that's going to be done, say, by the – sometime in
the second quarter. What we're also going to be getting from AmeriHome is we're going to be able to have a kind
of ready deployment into mortgages that we would want to put in our balance sheet and we'd prefer to have
something that is low LTV, but higher yielding which pushes you toward kind of a non-QM solution, which they're
going to be rolling that product out as well. So, as our ability to do that happens and I think over the next couple of
quarters that's going to be the case. I mean, it wasn't random that we had this kind of massive deposit growth
during the quarter. We let it go in terms of bringing in more deposits, because now we have a near term ready
access to an almost limitless source of good quality asset deployment and I think you're going to see that in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I think the – on AmeriHome, the gain on sale picture has darkened somewhat since you announced
the deal. Can you give us any sense of what their gain on sale was in Q1 and how that may have compared to the
prior quarter or prior year?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We can't talk about their Q1 performance because they're part of a public enterprise [indiscernible] (00:23:48)
announced yet. But what we did mention was AmeriHome has the ability to pivot. So, we expected that margins
were going to be coming down. That is taking place today. But they have also the ability to take what we call their
win rate, which was about 7% and that is [ph] lying (00:24:07) about 7% of the loans that they looked at to – and
to increasing that.
And so, they've been doing that as well. So, they're pivoting appropriately. And we're standing by the $1.41 that
we indicated AmeriHome was going to benefit us in 2021. I think you're going to see $0.30 to $0.35 of that in the
second quarter as we phase this in, including the thing you just inquired about, Brock, regarding being able to pay
down their loans and stuff like that. So, we're in that process, right. Okay, that's where we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, Brock. It's Ken. I just want to add a few things. I if you recall back to our earnings call in – or our conference
call in early February, when we announced AmeriHome, we said that there were other opportunities to earn more
than the accretion numbers that we provided. We held those back because of some uncertainty that we saw
coming potentially with rising rates. And we're using all of those as we intended to in order to maintain our
earnings estimates for AmeriHome.

I wanted to touch on the deposit growth. I mean, you guys – I mean, even with the updated – with bumping up the
guide, I mean, this quarter, you've really massively outperformed that. Just wondering is there still – it feels like
the environment is still ripe to continue to do that. Is it possible that the deposit growth is conservative based on
the current environment, based on what you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, you think it's conservative because we told you $800 million and we came in at $6.5 billion?

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Maybe. Look, we're bumping up to a $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We've been performing at this level or better for the
last six to eight quarters. We have some real visibility into the pipeline based on either oral commitments or things
we're just finishing up the paperwork on now. So, yeah, there is a possibility to exceed both the deposit guide, as
well as the loan guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And on – so, on the cash balance at 15% on average in the quarter and I realize that you guys did get to
work in the back half of the quarter with securities and loans. But even with the paydown on the AmeriHome debt,
you're still probably at around 7% of cash [ph] position (00:27:02). What is your target level? How comfortable are
you driving that to what level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I mean, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion is what we consider to be kind of a core number, but as we deploy
that and pull that number down and that number can fall substantially. And frankly, the securities book is at least a
third or 40% higher than it needs to be too. Now that's better than cash, but not as good as some of these other
loan-based alternatives.
So, I do expect that we're going to have a couple of quarters where we're going to right-size our loan-to-deposit
ratio. It wasn't that long ago that we were in the 90s. Now, we're down at 75%. Well, doing that means that loan
growth will be well in excess of a $1.5 billion as we've increased that loan-to-deposit ratio. That's going to get
under way in the next – in the not too distant future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just some follow-ups on the NIM side of things, the new money loan yields that you're seeing in
– on mortgage as well as new money yields on securities purchases?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, the securities purchases, the yields that we got was at 2.20%. And new loan yields that we're putting on
are running about 20 to 25 basis points lower than what the average is, I think we are experiencing pricing
pressure.
I think that the velocity that the industry and the economy has come out of this pandemic has resulted in kind of
reduced expectations for credit losses industry wide, and that's being reflected in price. But again, what we've got
the ability to do is to drive volume and to shift our focus in terms of where the best kind of risk-adjusted returns will
be.

Hey, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wanted to stick with some questions around AmeriHome. Just kind of curious how much the change and
increase in loan guidance is related to you guys retaining more production from AmeriHome? And what – and if
so, does that have any impact on kind of what AmeriHome would contribute on a standalone basis going forward,
or is it all kind of interconnected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so, I mean, our – kind of our core number, I wouldn't say is AmeriHome dependent. I mean, we've been
buying mortgages from other sources that was – it happened in the first quarter and last year. What AmeriHome
gives us is a more profitable way to do that rather than going to other parties. We can kind of keep it all in the
family. And also, kind of a ready full bore in terms of ability to do that. So, what we're going to get from
AmeriHome is, also on top of that is to be able to again kind of right-size our loan-to-deposit ratio in a way that's
certainly accretive to net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. I guess, maybe ask differently, Dale, is – are the two sort of exclusive of one another, you're increasing
loan guidance, but then you still think AmeriHome can contribute what it was going to when you initially
announced this back in February?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We increased our loan guidance irrespective of AmeriHome that is that, we – all of last year, we certainly
didn't have AmeriHome and we were in a pandemic and never once were we under $1 billion. So, it's in part
acknowledgement of that. So, we can do this without AmeriHome, but AmeriHome gives us, I don't know, more
confidence to be able to execute a better price point for the residential real estate we pick up. They're going to be
expanding their product line. That's going to give us kind of even more volume. So, we're – AmeriHome doesn't
affect $1 billion to $1.5 billion if that's kind of what you're getting at Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, I know when you announce the deal, you – your intention was
to sell some of the MSRs. Did this come in line with about what you were thinking and sort of how does that
impact kind of their run rate in terms of gain on loan sale margin going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. This is Ken. We actually sold the MSRs for more money than we had anticipated. So, we feel good about
that in terms of the transaction. By getting these – getting this large amount off our books allows us to do smaller
MSR transactions going forward, which we think we should get better – a better pricing on.

And so, the regions all ended about $1.9 billion, all right. Warehouse lending did about $2.1 billion. Tech and
innovation is about $760 million, our HOA business, just under $700 million. By the way, HOA did as much in this
quarter as it did almost all of last year. So, those are the big drivers of HOA – of deposit growth, Chris.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Or I should just add – I'm sorry, there's a couple of things in there too which we're excited about. We never give
you the names of our two deposit businesses, but our deposit business one grew $500 million in Q1 and deposit
business two, which we always said was well behind deposit business number one, grew $50 million. So, we're
getting excited about what these businesses can do for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. It's great color. In terms of the C&I growth, can you – maybe I missed in your prepared remarks. Did you – I
know the last quarter you said that your guidance was inclusive of growth in the warehouse, but did you tell us
what the warehouse balance changes were in the commercial book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Are you asking – I'm not certain of your question. Ask it again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sure. The mortgage warehouse and how much of that is in the lending side? How much of the growth this quarter
was warehouse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. All right. The warehouse lending this quarter, and we include three items in there. We include warehouse
lending, MSR lending and our note finance, which is a separate business, but we have it on the warehouse
lending. That collectively grew $560 million for this quarter. And we came in with an understanding this year that
we keep warehouse lending basically flat to its ending balance of 2020. But we keep telling you we keep winning
share there and it manifests itself here in Q1 as you can see.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. One just kind of housekeeping on PPP. Can you give us what
the average loans outstanding were for the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We have about $1.5 billion in loans remaining [ph] with – including two, of course (00:36:09).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Right. Got you. Okay. In terms of – as you're kind of thinking forward and knowing that obviously adding more resi
mortgage will change this. But can you kind of just run through from a loan sensitivity perspective what amount of
your loans are variable rate today and kind of status within the money floors as we start thinking a little further out
to prospective rate actions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, today, the floors are active in the preponderance of our portfolio. So, we are – we're behaving as if we're 80%
fixed. We have, I think, an interesting asymmetrical profile whereby, if rates go lower, we see very little contraction
of net interest income because [ph] the rest is (00:37:03) floors. But if rates rise, our loan yields become even
more asset sensitive because they'll be lifting off of the floors kind of going forward. So, it's an asymmetrical
benefit for us relative to where we are. So, we – yeah, 80% of our book today is behaving as if it's fixed rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. That's just in terms of if there is – is it one rate hike, two rate hikes until there's an actual upward benefit in
those variable rate loan yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I mean, it's staggered. Some are immediate. They are kind of – others are 100 basis points away. So, I
would say on average, you're going to need to see probably two rate increases before you're going to start seeing
kind of notable improvement in terms of loan yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Even though all these loans are variable, we're putting them on at the floor so they're looking like they're
fixed rate loans today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Right. And then, just last question, you talked about mortgage warehouse and continuing to win business
there and taking share and, obviously, the warehouse deposit balances grew pretty significantly. Could you just
talk about the kind of sensitivity of mortgage warehouse related deposits relative to overall volume – overall
mortgage volume?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, warehouse lending, I think, started out 10, 12 years ago, it was an interesting idea and we see if we can get
another channel going to something today where it's just a very important strategic weapon for us. It's delivering
more in deposits than we anticipated because primarily of the service we deliver and the fact that we moved
upscale [audio gap] (00:38:57) upmarket in dealing with some of the larger, more sophisticated clients. They are
feeling more comfortable consolidating more and more of their deposits with us. All right. And there's – some of
the large clients, there is a disproportion between we have much more in deposits than we have in their loan
balances.
But we're continuing to gain share in both the loan side and the deposit side. I just would say that some of the
competitors that we normally see are just not performing as well as they should in terms of service levels. And
we've got – I think I said this maybe at the last earnings call. If you think of us as an airport, we've got planes
circling overhead looking to land and give us their business. And for us, it's a matter of how quickly we can
onboard both the deposit and the loan business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think it's important to note, to remember that deposit balances aren't really the business. So, it's not operating
accounts from these. So, let's say the refi business contracts dramatically, that can affect the actual balances of
the enterprise, but that is a very small piece of the deposit balances we have. [indiscernible] (00:40:20) balances
we have that drive that number is the escrow relationships. And that's based upon the mortgage servicing that
some of these enterprises own. So, you can see volatility in the origination side. But the MSRs drive the deposit
balances and that tends to be much more stable as – because people maintain mortgages on their houses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Timur Braziler from Wells Fargo. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just following up on that last mortgage warehouse discussion, I guess, how sensitive is
that business to steepening yield curve? And if broader industry trends start to slow down, would the circling
runway, is that kind of irrespective of what's happening industry wide as you onboard new clients? Or if there is a
broader slowdown we should expect to see volumes and growth rates low as well at Western Alliance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, good question there. When we came into 2021 in the planning year for our overall growth, we did not
have warehouse lending stepping up in terms of balances. But, obviously, we had a good first quarter and we're
going to continue that trend going into quarters two, three and four. What we're seeing is two things. One, there's
just a natural rise in terms of taking market share with the clientele we have today. And then on top of that, we will
get a benefit from penetrating the AmeriHome client list. So, they've got, as I said, 720 clients. We've got about a
14


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
100 or so that overlap and we're going to be able to penetrate going into their clients. So, if you can picture that
we go into one of the AmeriHome clients and say look, we're willing – we give you a line of credit, just call it $25
million for argument's sake. And we'll also buy – after you accumulate loans on that line, we'll also take you out of
that line. That's a very powerful argument to offer sort of a two for one opportunity to the AmeriHome clients. So,
we haven't fully factored that into our numbers yet, but that gives us some confidence that we should be able to
continue to grow our warehouse lending business on the loan side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. So as we start thinking about your new loan growth guidance, it shouldn't just be what you've
been putting on existing plus the rest of the increase guide coming directly from [indiscernible] (00:43:21). We can
actually see mortgage warehouse continue to ramp higher and the larger component of that growth [indiscernible]
(00:43:29)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I just want to clarify what you said, these $1 billion to $1.5 billion is basically business as we do it today, all
right. So you'll see already more purchases continue and you'll see more our funding growth as if we never had
the AmeriHome acquisition. The AmeriHome acquisition, as we ramped it up, will provide either comfort to
achieving that $1 billion to $1.5 billion or if we do it really well, it will help us succeed that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. On the residential side, I think in quarters past, you guys have talked about the
concentration of 20%. Do you have a concentration limit in mind. And I guess, as we're building out what
residential loan growth could look like, how big of the overall loan portfolio can we envision that becoming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I think we can easily punch through 20%. I mean the average bank our size is 30%. First Republic is just
under 60%. So I mean what we like about the space is, I mean, it's very good quality performance. Now we've got
kind of an unlimited channel into that some other kind of cross-sell opportunity, some of which we've talked about
that we can pick up. So we're definitely going through 20% and toward the median at least for now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
That's a very strong book we have, right. 759 FICO, DTI of about between 34 and 36 below 70% LTV. We could
probably give you a list of all the folks that have been gone 90-day delinquent, it's usually just an unusual event
and we've not had a loss in the book. So, it really helps to bring a lot of asset quality to – good asset quality to our
loan composition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then just last one for me, back on the deposit side, I'm wondering how much of the growth,
if any, is coming from the extension of the tax deadline and what that could look like for balances as customers go
to pay tax bills in the next [ph] month or so (00:45:42).

Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Yeah. That's more of a consumer phenomenon, I would say, and our liquidities have been coming in strong all
through 2020 – remember 2020, we did $9.1 billion of liquidity which far, far exceeded our best, best year ever
and this quarter we did $6.5 billion which – just in one quarter.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Chiaverini from Wedbush Securities. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the pace of securities purchases. You had a strong ramp up in the first quarter.
Going forward, should we expect that pace to slow somewhat as you pay down debt with the closing of
AmeriHome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes, it will absolutely slow. What we did is we've been sitting on a lot of growth from the fourth quarter, also the
first quarter. And so, we wanted to deploy some of that. Again the balancing act we're trying to do is look, we can
get 10 basis points if we keep it at the Fed, that's pretty meaningless. We can get 3% if we can put it out into low
LTV home loans or we can go into the securities book, and as I said we've got 2.20%. So, it's a little bit of a
compromise there because it is going to take us sometime late – within this year, but sometime to deploy the
liquidity that we have and also the new deposit growth that we expected continue to generate.
So, but over time, yeah, I think our securities book can actually bleed down but I wouldn't expect to see that
anytime soon. But no, I think the growth in the book and the security side is largely behind us. We're using our
current liquidity to pay off all of the AmeriHome debt and then also to begin to purchase non-QM mortgages
through that channel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. That's helpful. And I also wanted to follow up on the NIM commentary. You mentioned about how the drag
should moderate going forward and I see in the slide deck how the spot rate on loans is about 13 basis points
lower than the portfolio average in the quarter in terms of magnitude of being down. Well, I guess, the clarification
is to expect continued margin compression, but just not clearly as much as the 47 basis points in the first quarter,
is that the way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, again, we're focused on is – we're focused on how do we increase the earning power of the
company and translate that into EPS. Margin has very little to do with that. So, brain power, we think, hey, low
16


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
cost, stable core deposits that we can deploy into profitable assets. Now, gosh, I'd love to get 5% for that without
risk. We're not seeing those opportunities at scale at that price point. So, what are we doing?
Well, we're going to residential where we have unlimited and that's two points less. But if I add mortgage loans at
3% and our margins at 3.37% that's going to decrement that margin a little bit, but instead if I think about it, I've
got investments at 10 basis points [indiscernible] (00:49:15) that's already on the books and I can put that out at 3
basis points that would help the margin even though that spread is actually lower because I'll take it from 10 basis
points to 300 basis points. So the combination of those two things, is it possible the margin comes down a little
bit? Yeah. I think that would actually be likely a good thing because what it really means is that we're continuing to
move the fundamental footings of the balance sheet that we can then deploy into earning assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And so, I want to add one other thing to what Dale said. Our focus on net interest income rather than NIM started
in early 2018. So, this is not a new phenomenon for us. We have talked about this since the early part of 2018
that this was the direction that we're going to take which is prioritize net interest income growth over NIM. Simply
said net interest income is going to drive EPS.
One of the things I'm very proud of this quarter was two less days, we made more in net interest income than we
made in Q4. So our strategy is being executed upon. And Dale said our goal is to keep that net interest income
looking robust for the next several quarters as we continue to deploy the excess liquidity and continue to upgrade
our guidance as to what we're going to bring in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That all makes sense and then a last housekeeping item. I think you mentioned merger charges, you're expecting
$15 million, roughly $15 million mostly in the second quarter. Is your expectation now that it's going to be in total
lower than the $35 million that was discussed at the announcement of AmeriHome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes. Ken was alluding to that earlier in terms of the pricing that we got on the disposition of the MSR book. I mean
the preponderance of those fees that we're going to be incurring are basically de-conversion costs from our
outsourced mortgage servicer to the purchaser, that transaction you close within the next few weeks.

Good Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I wanted to follow up Ken on your comments about the reserve level maybe maintaining more of a flat level going
forward. Is that, sort of, on a relative basis to loans outstanding, in other words, I guess, CECL impacts maybe
more muted and loan growth coming more from commercial going forwards or kind of stay more stable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
That was really, it's a numerator and denominator thing. What I was trying to say is the balance is going to stay
relatively flat. With the way we're growing, you can see the ratio drop but the balance we think will be relatively
flat. A lot of that, as you know, with CECL is just driven by the economic outlook, which we can really move the
numbers. But what should not be lost upon are our shareholders, investors, the analyst community is that 42% of
our portfolio is in loans or asset categories that we've never ever had a loss on or loss in, I should say and that's
what also drives the CECL calculation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And maybe just as a follow-up, just thinking about the pace of growth relative to capital, capital levels
gotten a little skinny even with the issuance this quarter. I know, PPP, kind of, has an impact on the PCE ratio.
But just we think about, you guys are willing to grow, if growth is there and you'll raise capital as needed or would
you tamper some of the mortgage growth areas that may be more of a flex area on the balance sheet to stay
within kind of capital ratios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. If we need capital to grow, I think you can look for us to do the right thing and raise capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And if I can sneak in one last one just with AmeriHome, kind of, on the books I guess now, Ken, just trying
to think about sort of the buy versus build equation going forward. You guys always have some deposit loan
growth verticals in the pipeline that you're building but has this changed your view on that equation or what you'd
like to do on a go-forward basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, not at all. I mean, the AmeriHome team has a couple of things that they would like to look at in terms of new
opportunities. And I mentioned them non-QM channel, jumbo channel are just two of them that jump right out. But
that's separate, that team can work on that as the commercial side of Western Alliance can work on other
business opportunities. And we're continuing to work on those opportunities now. And we're probably one of the
few banks that is sitting here, working on 2022's growth levels. That's how far out we are in what we think in terms
of our pipeline and our visibility.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Coffey from Janney. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Coffey Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you, gentlemen. So, in the quarter, residential mortgages were about 40% of our net loan growth.
Would you expect it to be that level going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yes. I think that's going to continue and as I mentioned that's kind of the core piece, I think 40% is not a
bad number. When we sop up our excess liquidity, it's going to skew much higher than that because a lot of that
is going to be directly toward mortgage acquisitions is where we see something kind of well in excess of $1.5
billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Coffey Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And on the efficiency ratio, is kind of – you think as we go – given the growth this past quarter and as you
go through the year adding AmeriHome and such, do you think 45% is going to become a new level for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, it's going to be 45%, 46%-ish or something in there, but, yeah, mid-40s. I think that's kind of where it's fairly
stable at that level, something under 50% for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Coffey Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And can you talk a little bit about what it is about Western Alliance that allows you to maintain kind of
expense growth at a level well below asset growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So let me try that. I think a lot of that, when we talk about our national commercial business line strategy,
we generally talk about it in terms of the growth that it brings in. And that's very helpful to keeping the efficiency
ratio low. But these businesses are, for the most part, have very, very high operating leverage, and that's one of
the characteristics. There are several characteristics of the national strategy, generally very few competitors,
pricing power or stability, great asset quality, and then the fourth one we love is very high operating leverage.
And as the growth shifts over to that, coming from those national business lines, just the natural calculation of the
efficiency ratio will keep us more moderate as compared to our peer group. The other thing is we're just growing
revenues, as I said upfront, four times faster than expenses. And that too we'll keep the efficiency ratio in line.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Dale, question for you. Can you go back and review the loan-to-deposit comments you made earlier and
where you think you might sit at the end of the second quarter and maybe end of the year, can you help us with
that a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, well, so I mean, it's something we're trying to get underway now. I think that at the end of the second
quarter, I expect we maybe will be close to where we are presently, maybe a little bit better with the $1 billion,
$1.5 billion in growth of each. I think we're going to be able to get these kind of new products out with
AmeriHome, maybe by the end of the second quarter into the third and then [ph] would (00:58:01) they see
billions of dollars certainly in volume and so we can move rapidly on that.
I personally would like to be kind of at the 90% range back to loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of the year. And so, I
mean, if you take where we are, where we right-size that, where we have very substantial growth from just where
we are as of 3/31. We had $3.4 billion of loan growth at a 3.5% spread, that's already in the books as of 3/31.
That generates about nearly $10 million a month of increased PPNR just from deploying that out of liquidity. Then
you add in AmeriHome with this, we expect to be at an EPS run rate of $9 as we exit 2021.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I just want to punctuate what Dale said for a moment there, Jon. Everyone's talking about the liquidity and loan-
deposit ratio. We're talking about net interest margin versus net interest income. What Dale just said is the crux of
how we structured the business that the $3.5 billion that we just put out and the $10 million that we're making a
month pre-tax, $30 million a quarter, that is very, very powerful and that's what leads us to have a certain degree
of confidence along with the AmeriHome acquisition that we can exit the year at that $9 EPS run rate.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I was going to ask if you think numbers should go up, but you answered that for me. I do want to ask one
more question, and it won't be on deposits. But could you talk about lending outside of your national businesses
some of the pipeline trends and what you're seeing in construction just as a kind of a gut check on what you're
thinking on the overall economy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, actually, what we're seeing inside of our footprint is exactly what we're seeing outside of our footprint.
So, on the construction side, residential, that's very hot for us at this moment. Homes take five to seven months to
build, they're extending out a little bit longer than that because of some labor shortages. And so the cost is a little
bit higher, but once they're built, boom, they're sold rather quickly.
So one of our struggles, of course, is how you keep those really good loans outstanding for a longer period of
time. But the construction site, single family residences are really hot, build-to-rent opportunities which for us are
mostly in our footprint more so than outside of our footprint. Arizona seems to be build-to-rent capital, the outskirts
of Phoenix. And the West Valley seems to be very, very active and we're doing a number of deals there.
I'm going to let our Chief Credit Officer, who's been sitting here patiently and hasn't said a word, Tim Bruckner.
Tim, do you want to comment on this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Residential and commercial, I think there were definitely some things that sat on the shelf last year with the
uncertainties of the pandemic. So projects delayed. So we're seeing that move forward. And so we – as we look
out across 2021, we don't see any big shifts in loan demand. We see stability across the major [ph] HOA
(01:01:58) groups within our real estate portfolio. So we're not seeing trends in rent payments that are alarming.
We're seeing things that give us comfort and we're maintaining a very close and direct monthly or weekly dialogue
even with our borrowers. It gives us that information. So I think outlook is very, very, positive for us across all the
segments, real estate as well as residential.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And we're very active in the net migration in states as you would expect as they're seeing even more activity. But I
should have said, it does not only pertains to construction of single-family residences but on the industrial side,
we started finance the number of spec projects for industrial warehouses and before the show is even completed,
they are already leased up and no longer are they spec. They're all pre-leased. So that give you an example of
how hot the CRE market is for us.

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes. Just a data point on that, that portfolio is stabilizing and has stabilized faster now than at any time in the past
four years, our portfolio. So it is moving very quickly.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Jon, we didn't have time to give you a short answer, we hope the long one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No, that's fine. And I guess, just the one thing you did flag this and I want to make sure, it's out there. But you did
say you're expecting some movement in special mention and classified, but it doesn't sound like you're concerned
about it at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The answer – the short answer is yes. We've looked around. We don't see anything on the horizon that's going to
give us a little bit of trouble. And we feel good about where the asset quality is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
