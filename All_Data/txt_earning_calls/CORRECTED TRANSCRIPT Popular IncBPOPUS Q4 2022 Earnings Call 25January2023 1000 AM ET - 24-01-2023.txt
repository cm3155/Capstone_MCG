Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Our results for the quarter and the full year were solid and reflect
the strength of our franchise. Our record annual net income of $1.1 billion reflects an increase of $168 million
above our 2021 annual net income of $935 million. The increase was largely driven by the benefit of the Evertec

transactions and the partial reversal of the DTA valuation allowance. The results also reflect higher net interest
income, partially offset by higher provision expense and higher operating expenses. The 2021 results included a
provision benefit of $193 million.
During the summer, we completed the acquisition of key customer-facing channels from Evertec and also made
important changes to our contractual relationship with them. Leveraging these transactions, we have embarked
on a broad-based, multiyear technological and business process transformation. The needs and expectation of
our clients as well as the competitive landscape have evolved, requiring us to make important investments in our
technological infrastructure and adopt more agile practices. Our technology and business transformation will be a
significant priority for the company over the next three years and beyond.
We believe that there continues to be an opportunity for growth in our primary market as well as within our
existing customer base and these efforts will help capitalize upon that opportunity. We are confident that these
investments will make us a stronger, more efficient and profitable company.
Throughout 2022, we continue to return capital to our shareholders. During the year, we repurchased 8.25 million
shares of common stock for $631 million, which surpassed our original expectation of $500 million. We also
increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.55 per share, representing nearly $164 million in dividends
paid in 2022.
Credit quality remained strong throughout 2022. We are pleased with how our portfolios have continued to
perform, particularly with net charge-offs, well below historical levels and a lower level of non-performing loans.
Our capital levels are strong with year-end Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.4%.
Our tangible book value ended 2022 at $44.97, a 31% decrease year over year, primarily due to unrealized
losses on investment securities. However, during the fourth quarter, tangible book value increased by 16%.
Please turn to slide 4. Our quarterly net income, excluding the partial reversal of the DTA valuation allowance,
was $189 million or $7 million lower than the adjusted third quarter net income of $196 million. Fourth quarter
results were impacted by lower net interest income, which reflected higher loan income but was more than offset
by the higher cost of public deposits as well as a higher provision for credit losses. Loan growth was strong and
broad based during the quarter, both geographically and across most loan segments. Total loan balances held in
portfolio grew by $560 million. Commercial loan growth in particular was healthy at most banks in the fourth
quarter.
Our net interest margin decreased by 4 basis points to 3.28% in the quarter. Higher deposit costs, particularly in
our Puerto Rico public deposit portfolio and a [ph] couple of banks (00:05:00) impacted the margin. This was
offset in part by an improvement in asset mix due to loan growth and a reduction in the investment portfolio.
Credit quality trends remained favorable during the period. Nonperforming loans decreased in the quarter and net
charge-offs have remained well below pre-pandemic levels.
Please turn to slide 5. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by approximately 28,000 during the year, reaching
1.98 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong.
Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million or 56% of our customer base. Additionally, we
continue to capture more than 60% of our deposits through digital channels. This trend remains significantly
higher than pre-pandemic levels and well above our [ph] island peers (00:05:57).

Commercial loan growth was strong. Commercial loan balances of BPPR and Popular Bank increased by $118
million and $255 million, respectively. Credit card and auto loan and lease balances at BPPR increased by $53
million and $31 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the dollar value of credit and debit card sales of our
customers increased by 11% sequentially and was 6% above the fourth quarter of 2021.
As on the mainland, mortgage originations Puerto Rico have been impacted by rising rates and limited inventory
of available properties. The dollar value of mortgage originations at BPPR decreased by 29% compared to the
fourth quarter of last year, driven by lower refinance activity due to the interest rate environment. However, loans
to finance the purchase of homes increased only 11% during the same period.
The local economy continued to perform well during the fourth quarter and business activity has remained strong.
We remain encouraged by solid employment levels. In December, total nonfarm employment in Puerto Rico
increased slightly from its level in September and was 4% higher than in December of 2021. New auto sales
increased by 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2021. While auto sales declined by 4% in
the year, 2022 was the second highest year of sales since 2006, easily surpassing pre-pandemic levels,
evidencing continued robust demand for cars and [audio gap] (00:07:42) The industry is forecasting new car sales
of 118,000 with 2023, well above pre-pandemic levels.
The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy, as Puerto Rico is a
proper destination for mainland residents. Airport traffic has remained robust. Year to date to December, total
passenger traffic increased by 7% compared to 2021. Hotel demand has also remained strong. Occupancy rates
were up more than 500 basis points in 2022 and the average daily room wait continues to compare favorably to
historical results. In short, we are pleased with the results for the year, particularly our robust loan growth and
continued strength in credit quality. We are mindful of the global economic uncertainty and market volatility but
remain optimistic about the future of Puerto Rico, our primary market and our ability to manage through any
potential challenges that may lie ahead.
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio, good morning. Before we turn to fourth quarter results, let me expand on Popular's 2022 full
year performance, which is included in the appendix to this presentation and today's press release.
In 2022, we reported record annual net income of $1.1 billion, $168 million of our 2021 annual net income. The
increase was largely driven by the benefit of the Evertec transactions and the partial reversal of the DTA valuation
allowance, somewhat offset by provision expense.
Our net interest income increased by 11% year over year to $2.17 billion due to higher rates, loan growth and the
change in the mix of earning assets. For the year, we reported an $83 million provision for credit losses, which
compares to a provision benefit of $193 million in 2021. Non-interest income increased by $254 million year over
year, primarily driven by the impact of the Evertec transactions. Operating expenses increased 13% in 2022 to
$1.75 billion with higher personnel, technology, professional fees and regulatory cost.
Please turn to slide 6. Net income for the fourth quarter was $257 million. This compares to $422 million in Q3.
Excluding the impact of the Evertec transactions in Q3 and the DTA reversal in Q4, net income decreased $7
million to $189 million in Q4. Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $560 million, a decrease of $20 million
from Q3. Interest income grew by $62 million from loan growth on both banks as well as higher yields on loans

and investment securities. This was more than offset by higher interest expense on deposits resulting from
increased deposit rates, mainly from Puerto Rico public deposits and to a lesser extent, Popular Bank.
Non-interest income was $158 million, a decrease of $268 million from Q3. The results of the third quarter
included a $250 million pre-tax gain on the Evertec transactions and a favorable fair value purchase price
adjustment of [ph] $92 (00:11:09) million, related to the US equipment finance business we acquired in 2021.
Excluding these items, the remaining variance in non-interest income resulted mainly from lower deposit service
fees.
The fourth quarter non-interest income results fully embed the changes in overdraft policies and the reduction in
equity pickup from the sale of our Evertec shares. The results also include an $8.2 million gain on the sale of a
previously written-off investments. Excluding this gain, the non-interest income for the quarter would have been
approximately $150 million. For 2023, we expect non-interest income to continue around this $150 million per
quarter run rate or approximately $600 million for the – the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $50
million compared to $40 million in the third quarter.
Total operating expenses were $462 million in the quarter, a decrease of $14 million from the prior quarter. Q3
includes $17 million expenses [indiscernible] (00:12:16) to the Evertec transactions and a $9 million goodwill
impairment on our US equipment finance business. Excluding these items, expenses increased by $12 million,
mostly resulting from a $10 million increase in technology expenses, seasonally higher business promotion
expenses by $4 million, higher other processing and transactional services by $4 million, mainly due to higher
network incentives received during the prior quarter and higher professional fees. For 2023, we expect annual
expenses of approximately $1.87 billion compared to our expenses of $1.75 billion during 2022.
The drivers of the $120 million increase will be, first, continued increase in personal expenses driven primarily by
the previously announced increase in our minimum hourly wage from $13 to $15, which took effect on January 1.
This will add approximately $15 million to expenses in 2023. Additionally, the market salary adjustments that were
made effective on July 1 of last year will be in effect for the full-year 2023. There will also be a 2023 [indiscernible]
(00:13:31) increase that traditionally is granted in the summer. These two items will add approximately $24 million
to expenses in 2023. These actions are necessary to keep our compensation competitive.
Second, we expect that the FDIC's 2 basis points increase in assessment rate to all depositary institutions will add
$14 million to expenses. Patient and retirement health care expenses will also increase by $19 million.
Finally, as Ignacio described in his opening remarks, we have undertaken a significant multi-year corporate
transformation initiative. As part of this transformation, we aim to expand our digital capabilities, modernize our
technology platform and to implement agile and efficient business processes across the entire company. Since
completing the Evertec transactions on July 1 through the end of last year, we invested $24 million towards this
effort, primarily in professional fees and technology expenses.
In 2023, we anticipate transformational data expenses of $50 million. These technological ways of working and
operational investments will result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients, as well as better technology
and more efficient processes for our employees. We expect these efforts to contribute to higher earnings and
better efficiency, resulting on a sustainable 14% ROTCE target by the end of 2025. To facilitate the transparency
of our progress in some of these efforts, we have now separated technology, professional fees and transactional
activities [ph] standalone (00:15:13) items in our income statement.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 24%, compared to an expense of 14% in the third quarter.
The income tax benefit in Q4 was mainly due to the $68 million partial reversal of the DTA valuation allowance of
the US operation. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 12% compared to 14% in
the third quarter. This partial reversal was based on our evaluation of the sustained profitability of the US
operation over the last two years as well as evidence of stable credit metrics, while considering the remaining life
of the net operating losses. As of December 31, 2022, the DTA related to US operations was $278 million, net of
our valuation allowance of $423 million. For the full-year 2023, we expect the effective tax rate to be in a range of
18% to 22%.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest income was $160 million. On a taxable equivalent basis, it was $622 million,
$25 million lower than in the third quarter. Net interest margin decreased by 4 basis points to 3.28% in Q4. On a
taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 3.64%, a decrease of 7 basis points. The decrease is driven by higher interest
expense on deposits due to a significant, though anticipated 159-basis-point increase in the cost of public
deposits. It was partially offset by higher loan balances and yields [indiscernible] (00:17:04) improved mix of
earning assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, public deposits were roughly $15.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2
billion from Q3. We expect public deposits to be in a range of $13 billion to $15 billion during 2023.
Over the next couple of quarters, the balance of public deposits should increase given the cyclical nature of tax
collections. However, the balances should decrease during the second half of 2023. Excluding Puerto Rico public
deposits, deposit balance has declined by $1.4 billion in the quarter, mainly from excess cash balances of
corporate clients. These declines are reflective of clients pursuing better yields on excess [ph] liquidity (00:17:51).
Popular continues to have a strong relationship with [ph] these clients (00:17:55). Our Puerto Rico commercial
deposit balances remained $5 billion higher than they were in December of 2019. We will continue to actively
manage the cost of commercial deposits, taking into consideration the overall client relationship and our liquidity
position.
Retail deposit balances remain stable. Our ending loan balances increased by $560 million or almost 2%
compared to Q3 and are up by $2.8 billion or just under 10% year to date. Commercial loan growth was
particularly strong and all other loan segments were higher in the quarter except for construction. We are
encouraged by credit demand at BPPR and PB. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend
credit, thereby improving the use and yield of our existing liquidity. While we expect to see continued strong loan
growth in 2023, we do not anticipate it will replicate 2022's exceptional growth rate.
Please turn to slide 8. Year to date, our retail deposit franchise, particularly in Puerto Rico, has continued to track
below historical beta. Commercial deposit betas have remained low [ph] to are (00:19:17) now tracking slightly
above the prior cycle. Combined, retail and commercial deposits represent a lower proportion of total deposits
compared to the last [ph] three (00:19:27) cycle due to the increase in public deposits.
As we discussed last quarter, during the rapid shift of to higher interest short-term interest rates, we expect a
significant increase in the cost of public deposits. In the fourth quarter, the cost increased by 159 basis points. We
expect the magnitude of the increase in cost of public deposits to moderate in Q1 to approximately 120 basis
points.
As we had described in the past, the deposit pricing agreement with Puerto Rico public sector clients is market
linked with a Lag. This source of funding results in attractive – in an attractive spread under market rates.

Please turn to slide 9. In 2022, we reported a decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio that we expect to
be temporary. Our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and industry mortgage-backed
securities, which carry minimal credit risk. The bond portfolio has an average duration of approximately 2.8 years.
At the position [ph] roll down the yield curve, therefore value will convert to par (00:20:35) and the mark will go
down to zero.
As discussed in our last webcast, during the rapid increase in interest rates in 2022, as well as the uncertain
outlook for interest rates, in October, we transferred to held-to-maturity $6.5 billion of US Treasuries in the fourth
to sixth-year term, thereby reducing the future impact of rates on tangible book value.
At the time, this action reduced AOCI exposure to interest rates by about a third. When transferred to HTM, these
positions had a pre-tax unrealized loss of $873 million, which will be amortized back into capital throughout the life
of the transferred positions. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the balance of the unrealized loss stood at $832
million, a reduction of $42 million. We expect a similar quarterly amortization through 2026.
The yield on treasury securities remains the same and no losses were recognized as a result of this move. If
transfer doesn't have a material effect on our liquidity, as we continue to maintain a large available-for-sale
portfolio in short-term treasuries and cash [indiscernible] (00:21:52). The changes in realized gains and losses in
AOCI have an impact on the corporation's annual capital ratios as well as those of our wholly-owned banking
subsidiaries. They do not impact regulatory capital ratios.
Please turn to slide 10. Our return on tangible equity was 19.2% in the quarter. Regulatory capital levels remained
strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 35 basis points in Q4 to 16.4%. In December, we completed
our previously announced $231 million ASR, repurchasing approximately 3.2 million shares, an average purchase
price of $72.66.
To summarize our capital actions last year, we repurchased $631 million common stock or 8.25 million shares.
We had two separate ASRs and increase our quarterly dividend by $0.10 per share to $0.55 per share. Tangible
book value at quarter end was $44.97 per share, an increase of $6.28 per share from Q3 driven mostly by
quarterly net income of $257 million and a favorable variance of $193 million in unrealized losses on securities
available-for-sale. This is partially offset by dividends of $40 million declared in the quarter.
Our outlook of capital return has not changed, anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios. Over time, we
expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a spread. Given the
continued economic uncertainty, we still plan to revisit our future capital actions in the second half of 2023, once
we have more clarity around the outlook for interest rate and the economy.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continue to reflect stable credit quality trends with low
levels of net charge-off and decreasing non-performing loans. We remain encouraged by the performance of our
loan book post-pandemic. Specifically, early delinquency, net charge-off and non-performing loan formation
continue to trend significantly below pre-pandemic levels.
We also believe that the improvement in the risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolio positions Popular to
operate successfully under more difficult economic conditions. We remain vigilant and continue to closely monitor

changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment given potential economic headwinds,
rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty.
Turning to slide number 11, non-performing assets decreased by $18 million to $520 million this quarter, driven by
an NPL decrease of $14 million, coupled with an OREO decrease of $4 million. In Puerto Rico, NPLs decreased
by $8 million driven by lower mortgage NPLs of $10 million and lower commercial NPLs by $5 million, in part
offset by higher auto NPLs by $7 million.
In the US, NPLs decreased by $6 million, mainly due to a $9 million charge-off on a previously reserved
commercial borrower in the healthcare industry. Compared to the third quarter, NPL inflows, excluding consumer
loans, decreased by $3 million driven by the US health care relationship mentioned previously that was placed in
non-accrual in the prior quarter, offset in part by higher mortgage inflows in Puerto Rico. At the end of the quarter,
the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio remained flat at 1.4% compared to the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 12, net charge-off amounted to $31 million or annualized 39 basis points of average
loans held-in-portfolio compared to $18 million or 24 basis points in the prior quarter. The results of the quarter
were impacted by the $9 million charge-off on the previously reserved health care relationship in the US.
Excluding this item, net charge-off ratio was comparable to last quarter at 28 basis points. In Puerto Rico, net
charge-off remained stable, increasing by $1.5 million quarter over quarter, mainly driven by higher consumer net
charge-off by $5.5 million, mostly due to the auto portfolio, in part offset by lower mortgage net charge-off by $4
million.
The [ph] Corporation (00:26:52) allowance for credit losses increased by $17 million or 2.5% to $720 million,
driven by changes in macroeconomic scenarios, higher loan volumes and changes in credit quality. The ratio of
allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio remain stable at 2.25%, compared to 2.23% in the previous
quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 164%, compared to 155% in the
prior quarter.
The provision for credit losses was an expense of $48 million compared to $40 million in the previous quarter,
reflecting the changes in allowance for credit losses and the net charge-off activity. In Puerto Rico, the provision
for credit losses was $44 million compared to $29 million in the prior quarter. And in the US, the provision was $4
million compared to $11 million in the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 13. As discussed in prior webcast, we leveraged Moody's analytics for the US and
Puerto Rico economic forecast. Notwithstanding general economic uncertainty, Moody's baseline outlook remains
for the US economy to continue recession-free. Moody's fourth quarter forecast, however, reflects a slowdown in
the economy with lower 2023 GDP growth for both Puerto Rico and the US. The baseline scenarios assume a
2023 annualized GDP growth for Puerto Rico and the US of 1.3% and 0.7%, respectively, compared to 2.2% and
1.5% in the previous quarter. The reduction is due to the expected slowdown in the economy as a result of tight
monetary policy. The 2023 average unemployment rate remain consistent quarter over quarter.
Our framework for the allowance incorporates multiple economic scenarios. In the fourth quarter, we assign the
highest probability to the baseline scenario followed closely by the more pessimistic recession scenario S3. The
quarter-over-quarter difference in the allowance for credit losses was driven by the macroeconomic scenarios and
portfolio changes, which includes loan growth and changes in credit quality. To summarize, our loan portfolio
continue to exhibit strong credit quality metrics in the fourth quarter with low net charge-off and decreasing non-

performing loans. We remain authentic to the [indiscernible] (00:29:38) environment. We remain encouraged by
the post-pandemic performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates. 2022 was an outstanding year for Popular. In addition to record
earnings, we achieved strong credit quality, continued customer growth, closed the Evertec transactions,
launched our transformation and successfully executed on our capital actions.
Our franchise provides a powerful platform to go beyond serving our customers. It also affords us the opportunity
to positively impact the lives of our colleagues and communities and create value for our shareholders. In 2022,
we reached key milestones, including participating in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, issuing our ninth
corporate sustainability report. Also following Hurricane Fiona, we provided immediate relief to affected
communities and clients and assisted impacted employees.
Looking ahead, I am optimistic about the economic outlook in Puerto Rico, our primary market. While we are
aware of the macroeconomic headwinds related to inflation and geopolitical risks, we are confident that given the
amount of stimulus support from federal funds, Puerto Rico will continue its growth path albeit perhaps at a slower
pace.
2023 marks Popular's 130th Anniversary. Since 1893, we have successfully adapted and led through changing
conditions and we are proud of our history and the legacy that made Popular what it is today, a strong, vibrant
organization with deep-rooted values. Leveraging these strengths, we will continue to transform our organization
to ensure its success for many years to come.
This entails meeting the rapidly changing needs of our customers, providing our colleagues a workplace where
they can thrive, promoting progress in the communities we serve and generating sustainable value for our
shareholders. The team is energizing – is energized and looking forward to another strong year. We are now
ready to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Timur Braziler from
Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting on expenses and the technology and business process transformation that has been laid out, I
guess, on the back end of that, how should we think about Popular? Is this investment and kind of standing up
Evertec and getting that investment kind of up to where you expect it to be? Or is this getting Popular more
broadly on pace with the broader group? Or do you expect that at the back end of 2025 for Popular to be an
industry leader when it comes to tech and innovation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think. This is Ignacio. I think – thank you for the question. I think Evertec was the initial phase. It's more
than just Evertec. Obviously, Evertec has positioned ourselves to be able to begin to transform our technological
foundation. So it's more than just taking over the services Evertec was providing for us. That was an essential
step. But obviously, our goal is to be able to compete with the different entities that are coming to the market,
especially in terms of giving digital options to our clients. So yeah, we aspire – we aspire to be, if not best in class,
in top quartile in terms of the services and the products that we can offer for our clients. And Popular is
traditionally have been a leader in technology in Puerto Rico. And given what's happening now, I think it's more
important than ever that we take this initiative on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then in terms of investing into this initiative, is the expectation kind of $50 million per year through
2025 or does that ramp higher as you get closer to completion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I'm not sure we've been able to nail that down at this point in time, Timur. I think the – what we expect will
happen over time is that the expense will shift from the present expense, which is more weighted towards
professional services and consultants and people that are trying to help us stand up and set up what we want to
do and where we want to go. It will shift to execution. So, again, we haven't nailed down the number looking

forward to 2025. The composition of the expense will change into execution and putting in place the systems and
the technology that we're designing and selecting right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then maybe moving to NII and NIM. It looks like the inflection point happened here in the fourth
quarter. Just maybe an outlook for the magnitude of the remaining inflection as those public funds continue to lag
already happened interest rate hikes. And then more importantly, kind of once that lag is complete, what's the
outlook for NII and NIM growth from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, the components that led to our margin coming down this quarter, those pressures still exist for the
first quarter and moving forward. You described them properly that the most important one being the increase in
cost of public deposits. We – as we said last quarter, we expect NIM to retake an upward trend in 2023. Exactly
when in 2023 it happens will depend on the interaction of the drivers and you know what the drivers are. The rate
of loan growth, the rate of change in interest rates and deposit balances are the biggest three drivers. And the
interaction between those three will dictate exactly what happens in the year. But we do expect NIM to retake an
upward trend in the year 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q

Okay. Then maybe one last one for me, if I can, just circling back on fee income, the guide for around [ph] $150
(00:36:49) a quarter. I'm just wondering when does that inflect and when do we start seeing some of the positive
attributes from the combination with Evertec and getting those assets back in house?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Well, the biggest driver of the move down from our prior guidance to this 2023 guidance is a change in the fact
that we don't own the shares of Evertec anymore, number one. Number two, the change in our draft policies. And
number three, the change on our practice of shutting mortgages that we are not selling anymore.
So those are the biggest drivers of the shift down to [ph] $150 (00:37:35) per quarter roughly. Always remember,
there's always some seasonality in that number so it goes up and down for different things during the year but that
is the right range. We continue initiatives on our business initiatives to try to continue to move rates up in different
fronts. So hopefully, as those initiatives succeed, we can start moving rates up from where – from the [ph] $150
(00:38:04) and some of those are already being signed and implemented. If everything works well, we may start
to see some of that in 2023 but our best guess right now is [ph] $150 (00:38:16) per quarter.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I just wanted to ask some of the questions that Timur just asked a little bit differently. I'm just curious, when you
put out a target for 2025, why 2025? Does that represent sort of an inflection point or an endpoint in some of
these initiatives, or how can you pick those – that date or that year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. Basically, we picked that year – the transformation initiative is going to be an ongoing effort. It's a
way – it's going to change the way we work. But obviously, to sort of measure our success, we wanted to pick an
initial three-year period where we see where we're going to be at the end of the three-year period. And basically,
that's how we reached 2025. It was kind of arbitrary but we felt three years gave us enough time to implement the
measures that we're doing and to give them time to bear fruit. So – and that's how we picked it. But obviously, this
is [indiscernible] (00:39:28) and obviously, we expect all these efforts to be sustained. And now it's sustainable, so
it's not like we're going to reset and stop but keep growing incrementally over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. And then is Popular a leaner institution at that point, or like what's going to be different? I mean, obviously,
every bank is investing in technology meaningfully but does this allow you to operate with a reduced branch count
or sort of what like – what would we see that would be different at that point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I'm not sure branch count is the thing you'd expect to see the most. I mean, that would depend on traffic. We can
talk about branches separately but I think, obviously, we're aiming to do a lot more things digitally and we're also
aiming to do a lot more things self-service. So, for example, making our underwriting more, more automatic, so
you don't have to have as much manual intervention.
This is across, especially our businesses, but it'll apply to everything. Well, hopefully, we will do our – it will help
us with our compliance. We're investing on some technology, which is very manual today, very people oriented.
So really, I can't give you a specific date but definitely, over time, we should see a lot less manual intervention in
many of our processes, be the underwriting, be there compliance, be there everything. So I think that's the goal.
The goal is to be more digital more – have more self-service for our clients. And hopefully, over time, that's going
to impact us favorably.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Are there any sort of chunks of the initiative that might hit at any certain point in time? You mentioned that a
lot of the fees right now are being conducted towards the planning phase. And then there's going to be
implementation phase which maybe is more of a 2024 thing. But are there segments that you kind of – we can
sort of look at over the next couple of – maybe even more in the near term to sort of get a good sense for how to
track the progress?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, I'm not sure within the near term but one of the things that we, obviously, are going to want to be able to
report to you is what percentage of our loan applications will be digitally enhanced. And obviously, that – we will
be able to give you numbers on that. We'll be tracking that. And obviously, that will reflect in our efficiencies.
We've already implemented some things that are less technology-oriented because, again, this is more than just
technology. It's also process improvement in terms of how do we make sure that our pricing strategy for products
and services, including cash management, are coherent across the organization. We expect that to bear fruit,
pretty much, immediately. But [ph] honestly would (00:42:11) be a game changer but that'll bear fruit immediately.
So we'll be watching very carefully that in terms of revenues that we're getting from cash management. We're
going to make important investments in that area. Now, the technological area of cash management will take us a
few years. I mean, when you change a system for cash management, that'll be a couple of year process. But
we're very hopeful that will derive benefits for us. But again, we'll be following and closely tracking that, things
about doing enhanced applications, self-service applications. So those are things that we will be tracking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think one of the things that – we have a very strong belief that there is still a big opportunity for growth in
Puerto Rico with – by deepening the relationships we have with our existing clients. So a lot of the effort that's
going into transformation is for us to execute on that belief, meaning that we will be in a position to provide clients
quicker and better service, to offer them products that fit their need in a more efficient way. And with that, we
increase the transaction of our clients. That means we have more happy clients. We have more employees that
can actually execute with excellence what we're trying to do as far as client service and all those things add up to
positive outcomes as far as the contribution of all those clients to the bank.
I think that's a fair – these are incremental efforts. So, small things will start happening in a few months. Other
things will start happening next year. So, the bigger things are technology dependent will probably be – so a big
back ended because we have to make the investment and implement the systems to achieve what we want to
achieve. But we expect that there'll be some quick wins starting soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. To add to what Carlos was saying, I mean, one of the big initiatives is designed that what we call
personalization and segmentation. And therefore – and that involves a lot of investment in our data abilities also
but the idea is that we'll be able to offer our clients products that they need faster. And as you know, we have by
far the largest client base in Puerto Rico, both retail and commercial. And if we can just penetrate that market, the
13

(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
cost of – our cost of acquisition will be much below any possible competitors. So, we are going to put a lot of effort
into the personalization and segmentation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
And the last comment for you to get a sense of what we're talking about. And what we think, we have to build the
best digital banking offering in Puerto Rico already. But what we're seeking is to be able to provide more products
and services to our clients through that offering and to allow us to roll out new offerings a lot faster than we can do
it now. So we're changing the architecture of what is a market-leading digital offering so that we can be a lot more
effective in providing more and new services quicker to our clients than we are today. So, the client will never see
the change in back in architecture but they will see that the more efficient and bigger offering once we've done
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then with the 14% ROTCE, obviously, there's a lot of pieces to that and it could mean a lot of different
things. So can you give us some of the assumptions on capital levels or like anything else to kind of help us really
figure out what it actually means for profitability?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
No – at this point in time, we've chosen that one because it sort of encompasses a result of everything, Alex, and
there's – you are correct. There's a lot of pieces that compose that. We are not in a position to talk about the
pieces, specifically, yet right now. But again, we think this is the most comprehensive measure of everything that
we do, so we've chosen to hang our hat on that one for the moment. But we – at this point in time, we haven't
disclosed the components that will get us there and there's a lot of things that [indiscernible] (46:38) can change
along the way as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just one final one from me before I get back in the queue, you gave us the increase in the
government deposits in the first quarter of [ph] 120 (00:46:51). Assuming we get two more hikes, where do those
peak out? I mean, can you just spell it out for us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I'm afraid where they peak out, you'll have to ask the Fed. If it's true that they go down to two more [ph] 25
(00:47:08) and that's it and then they sit tight then a quarter after that, you'll [indiscernible] (00:47:15) 50 basis
points more expensive. And – but, it really is market [ph] leading (00:47:22) so depending on the Fed. Again, our
best guess of the Fed increases. If it will give us [ph] 120 (00:47:31), again, roughly if it's [ph] still more 125
(00:47:33), they will – that will end up being about 50 basis points higher the quarter after that. And once the rates
start moving in the other direction, then we'll see – that we'll start seeing the benefit a quarter after that. So, I
would love to be able to answer your question but I can't read the mind of the Fed very well.

But they do peak out below – I mean, the last time they peaked at 125 basis points but below where the Fed
peaked out, is that a reasonable assumption for this tightening cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
It is timing. And we would – ultimately, that – the question you were asking is what's the spread that we make
under deposit. We have never answered that question purposely. And we're not going to start today. But
obviously, we do make a positive spread on this – on the deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from the line of Kelly Motta from

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I – maybe asking the government deposits question a little bit
differently. I appreciate the color around margin and how you expect that to, I believe, it start to inflect at some
point this year. Does that commentary there require a certain amount of roll-off the government deposits or is that
irrespective of level? Just trying to get a sense of how much that may be a driver of that inflecting NIM you speak
of.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
That commentary incorporates the outlook we expressed on the [indiscernible] (00:49:25) deposits that they will
remain between [ph] 13 and 15 (00:49:29) for the year. Again, it's not a constant [ph] 13 to 15 (00:49:33). They're
probably going to be slightly higher than that in the first half of the year and then maybe slightly lower than that in
the second half of the year. But that is what is incorporated in the components of that commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much. Maybe last one for me. I appreciate the time – is on capital. I know you
reiterated that you plan to revisit your capital plans in the second half of this year. Wondering if that – kind of your
decision to do that is – there's a certain level of TCE where you would feel comfortable stepping back in. Is there
any sort of parameters around that you'd be willing to share? And that's part one. And then part two of the
question is, by second half of the year, do you think maybe by sometime in July, given the accretion back on
AOCI, is that kind of the timing we're looking at here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. So we try to answer both questions, Kelly. There is no TCE target that would trigger us to do something or
not do something. What – I think if anything, what will be more important on how we think about this is, again,
getting a more clear consensus of what's happening with the economy and what's going to happen with interest
rates moving forward. So I think those two components are probably more important.
There's – again, look, there's no magic number of TCE that will get us there. As Ignacio said last quarter, our best
guess is that we'll get the clarity we're looking for in the summer and that's where [indiscernible] (00:51:47) comes
from the second half of the year. But if that clarity comes in May, then we're a couple of months ahead. If that
clarity comes in September, we may be a couple of months behind but no specific target. The outlook and there
being consensus – a consensus outlook on the economy and interest rates are probably the two most important
inputs into the timing of our revisiting of the capital fund. Again, the overall view of capital is unchanged. We're
only slightly adjusting the timing here and when we execute, not our intent of what we want to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Happy New Year to you, too. Carlos, on the OCI or AOCI I should say, when you look at it, you had in the
available-for-sale portfolio about $1.8 billion of unrealized losses. Can you share with us what kind of interest rate
environment will we need to see for that number to fall materially from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I agree with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
No, I mean – look, I mean, the portfolio has about a 2.8 year duration, so that can give you some sensitivity on the
entire piece. Right? So you could probably run some calculations based on the duration and the size of the
portfolio. Should just give you an idea of roughly speaking, where the unrealized could move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, the – obviously the – as [indiscernible] (00:53:59) said, the portfolio is [ph] surged (00:54:01) on the short
end. So we are – we're the biggest bang for the buck. You'll probably get if it's shortened rates...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Short and intermediate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
There's a significant amount of bonds that mature every quarter. So the portfolios [ph] laddered up (00:54:39) all
the way up to the six years. But in fact, we probably have about $1 billion or so that mature any given quarter. So,
that also shortens the duration as time passes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And even though because – yeah. I'm sorry, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
And those get reinvested in current rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Right. No, the reason I asked is that I noticed that the agency portion of the portfolio which has the largest
unrealized loss has a maturity of 7.5 years. And even though I know the total AFS is under [ph] 3 (00:55:18), I
didn't know if that meant that part of the portfolio, the longer end of the curve is something we're going to watch.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, that piece – that portion of the portfolio is mostly agency [ph] factors (00:55:31). So, we put the weighted
average life of the instruments. That's a mix of 15-year and 30-year mortgage-backed securities. That has a
slightly different basis in treasuries, so that will be a function of where intermediate rates move as well as where
the mortgage-backed to treasury basis moves as well. So, we have some – some relief for that in the fourth
quarter. If those trends continue, that'll be positive news for that. But again, it'll be all be subject to where the
market sees the risks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then following up on the technology commentary that you guys gave us, Ignacio, I think you said
in your prepared remarks or actually in response to a question that Popular has traditionally been a leader in
technology in Puerto Rico. So somewhat surprising that this overhaul is coming. But be it as it is, were you guys
seeing or are you seeing evidence that other entrants are making headway against your core customers and
you're starting to lose some of these customers or what was the real or is that part of the reason for the big spend
that's coming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No. I think that when I say we are traditionally been a leader in the technology, that's true. But we feel the world is
changing much faster and we may have been a little bit behind where we normally would be on this kind of a
18


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
curve. We haven't lost customers yet but we're not going to wait to lose customers. We are seeing – there are
certain areas where you see more US entrants for example, credit cards – where you see more the US issuers
coming in with features and different things that we may be a little bit behind but, really, we want to get ahead of
this.
We don't want to leave ourselves open to future digital entrants taking away our clients. So basically, we think –
we really think that if we offer a top-notch digital experience and you combine that with our branch network and
you combine that with the diversity – the diverse services we offer our client that we have an unbeatable solution.
If we fall on any of those areas, then we could become [indiscernible] (00:57:59) and we're not about to let that
happen. So yes, we know that technology is a tough game and we may not be able to match the investments as
some of the bigger, huge banks but we have to stay at least giving our clients what they expect in today's world.
And our clients in Puerto Rico, just like anywhere else, they expect a better digital experience and they expect a
more personalized, digital experience and we're going to work hard to give them that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
To give some more color in Ignacio's comment, Gerard. When I talked about our data offering to our clients, I said
it was market leading, which it is. And I spoke about the back end, the architecture of it. We find ourselves
wanting to roll out more things at a faster speed than our present architecture allows us to do.
So again, what we're doing is doing a lot of work in the back end. The client will never even knew this was
happening but the client will feel it because the speed at which we'll be able to offer a new thing, add more things
will go up. So that is the kind of thing we're talking about. It is improving the core of our technology. And again, the
client may not see that in their phone app but they'll see it in the – in our capacity to offer them more personalized
offerings, more personalized services and new services faster than we can do today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, Lidio, you mentioned – you gave us some insights into the credit. And credit, obviously, has
been strong for you, folks and your peers. Two questions. One, you gave us some of the assumptions, I think, in
the Moody's outlook on real GDP growth. What kind of unemployment rates are you factoring in? I think you said
they're constant but what are those numbers?
And two, are there any sectors within the portfolio that you're currently [indiscernible] (01:00:01) to spending more
time really focusing on just to make sure nothing gets tripped up if we go into some sort of shallow recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
We have – on a yearly basis, we have on page 13 of the deck, the assumptions for unemployment rates both for
Puerto Rico and the US under the baseline, stronger growth and recession scenario. So I will leave you to look at
those.
As to – what's the second part of the question? I'm sorry, Gerard?

Lidio V. Soriano A

I would say small business lending is an area of focus. I mean, we continue to be pleased how the portfolio has
continued to behave post-pandemic [indiscernible] (01:00:57) area where increasing interest rates, inflationary
pressures, increases in energy prices could have a potential, higher impact than other sectors. I think it's
important to highlight that one area that – where we see a lot of pressure in the US in terms of office space, I don't
– we don't have any significant exposure to the office space in Puerto Rico or the US.

Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have that number right now, Alex. We can try to dig it out but I don't have that off the top of
my head or in my notes. My apologies. You can see that the overall yield of loans, the overall loan yield of our
book did go up 31 basis points [indiscernible] (01:02:12) quarter. So obviously, we are originating our new
vintages [ph] where you (01:02:20) need a higher rate. But I don't have the answer to your question. We'll get
back on it.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

Okay. Are you able to give us a little bit more color, like if you look in the commercial growth, sort of the
percentage or just a rough breakdown of what might be the larger corporate customer that's based off
[indiscernible] (01:02:40)? And we saw some press releases this quarter on sort of pricing that maybe we could
apply to that in Puerto Rico versus what might be more tied to prime.

Pretty limited.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
...pretty slow. So I think big picture assumptions for the moment, Alex, is that whatever part of our book is floating,
it's still linked to the old floating rates. Again, the pickup of [ph] sulfur (01:03:18) has been slow so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify your comments on the timing for capital return. It sounded like you guys go
through this process every year where you engage the Fed and then a quarter later or four months later, you wind
up actually telling us what you guys have all decided for the capital return. Is it the second half of this year that
you gave to the Fed or do you intend to have an announcement the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think our plan would be to do both. Do we would engage the Fed at some point? But the announcement, I
think, when we talk about second half of the year, it would be an announcement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So you engage the Fed at some point the next couple of months and, realistically July, we could still expect
a capital update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
We will make the decision of what we want to do once we have clarity on the outlook for interest rate and the
economy, Alex. So that is the starting point. So, again, our guess is that that point in time will come in the summer
and that we ended up talking about the second half of the year. So that's the starting point.
And from there, we would do our modeling and discuss the opportunities of the alternatives with our regulator. We
would have to decide how we want to execute anything we want to execute. We want to revisit what has been our
practice in the past of having very structured – every January, we have an announcement. We may choose to
change that moving forward. So we're going to – again, the underlying thing we want to do that has not changed,
which is to move in the direction of our mainland peers, plus a buffer. But exactly how do we execute that will be
revalued. And we may decide to execute it in a different path than we did in the past, okay?
So don't assume. We'll be back to getting an announcement and that's it for the year. Again, we may choose to
manage our capital return to slightly different, moving forward. If and when we choose to make a change,
obviously, we'll discuss it with the market.

Okay. But it is the same process that you've gone through. There's nothing changing about how often or the
regularity that you would engage the Fed to include in this. And I guess the question that I got from a lot of
investors after last quarter is why not go through the process as normal last year and then get approval but just
say we're not going to implement it as quickly. Maybe we'll wait and not do an ASR. But we have it and the Fed is
comfortable with our capital levels and all these things that seem exceedingly healthy from the surface.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
You are describing some of the alternatives that we are considering as we revisit how we want to do this. I always
caution everybody when we speak about this. The Fed does not give conditional approvals to anything. They will
only approve things when you request an approval and they will not approve things as long as things work out in
the future this way. So again, we try to manage the Fed the best way we can. I think over the last four, five years,
we've been pretty effective in our dealing with the Fed and will try to continue that. But some banks manages it
differently. Some banks have quarterly capital plans that they discuss with the trading instead of yearly capital
plan, which have been our practice in the past. Again, we want to go and revisit all those alternatives, Alex, to be
frank with you.
So we'll be doing that when we re-engage. Again, we think what we've done in the past has been pretty
successful for us as far as dealing with the Fed. We are analyzing this path that is even better for us and for our
shareholders going forward.
