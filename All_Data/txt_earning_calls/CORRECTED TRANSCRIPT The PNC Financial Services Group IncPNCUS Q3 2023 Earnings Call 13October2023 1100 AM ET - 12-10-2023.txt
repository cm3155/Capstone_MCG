Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the
third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you
through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
First, in the challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through
disciplined expense management. Our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful
approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development; all of which have
historically served us well in challenging economic cycles.
Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter. While we continue to
monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas, based on our current estimates, we are well-
positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate.
We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts and upgrading our
digital capabilities. And we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the
Signature Bank loans that we recently acquired.
Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment and have taken actions
to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our continuous improvement goal last quarter from $400
million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023.
Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we use
savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology.
In addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by
$325 million and will fall to the bottom line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense
management actions that will have impact on 2024.
While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently
deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management
going forward.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 3 and is presented on an average basis
and comparing to the second quarter.
Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances
at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%.
Borrowed funds increased $2 billion, primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter.
At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher
interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth
exceeded the negative impact of AOCI. Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And
we remain well-capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30
basis points linked quarter.
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion, or
2%, compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
Compared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2%, as growth in consumer was more than
offset by a decline in commercial.
Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million, reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances.
Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as pay downs
outpacing new production. Loan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly
driven by the higher rate environment.
Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion or 1% due to a decline in
consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated
non-interest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% in the second quarter and
consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the non-interest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in
the mid-20% range.
Commercial non-interest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter,
compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit non-interest-bearing mix remains stable at
10%.
Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior
quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July
expectation.
Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion
decreased $1 billion, or 1%, as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio pay-downs and
maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5%
and the runoff of lower yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was
4.2 years.
Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30. The weighted
average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07%. And the duration of the
portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately
$800 million in the third quarter as the negative impact of higher rates more than offset pay-downs and maturities
during the quarter.
Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase,
resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.
Turning to the income statement on slide 7. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the
same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Non-interest expense grew 2% and
was well-controlled, despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, we generated
3% positive operating leverage, and PPNR grew 9%.
For the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60
million or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million or 3%. And our
net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Non-interest income increased $32 million or 2% as
higher fee income was partially offset by lower other non-interest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127
million or 4% linked quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
Provision was $129 million in the third quarter. And our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable
impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately
16.5%.
Turning to slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million or 1%, compared
with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3%, as higher yields on
interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs.
Fee income was $1.7 billion, an increase of $67 million or 4% linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase in
fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which
were $97 million was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting
this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&A
advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter, despite robust pipelines. Going forward, we do
expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few
minutes.
Other non-interest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter, driven by lower private equity
revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30,
PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion.
Turning to slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter, which in part reflected
our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both a year-to-date and linked
quarter basis. Importantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter
of 2023.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the
pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize.
Nonperforming loans increased $210 million or 11% linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office
CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs.
In regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%.
The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status, which is an expected
outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio.
Ultimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential
losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans; and
inside of that, 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions,
especially in the higher rate environment to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions, and a full update
of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides.
Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million or 6% linked quarter, driven by higher consumer loan
delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net
charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter. And our allowance for credit losses
totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable with June 30.
Turning to slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well-positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September
30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels assuming the Basel III Endgame proposed rules were
effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the
5

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
impact of all other proposed Basel III Endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40- to
50-basis-point impact to our CET1.
Taken together, the current Basel III Endgame proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by
approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be
approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%.
In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to
evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on
market and economic conditions, as well as other factors.
In regard to the long-term debt proposal that the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding
constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank
level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company [ph] and the bank (00:14:12) to be approximately
$1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level
through our current funding plan as well as the restructuring of existing intercompany debt.
We acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are
subject to change. That being said, we're well-positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted.
Slide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from
Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many
years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry.
Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and
established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio. This acquisition is financially
attractive, given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio. Importantly, the
transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share.
Slide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense
management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our continuous
improvement program has been in place for over a decade. And through this program, we've utilized expense
savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments. Over the past 10 years, through CIP,
we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP
target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target.
Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect the 2024 annual CIP goal of
similar magnitude to the 2023 program. Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in
our company, while still delivering low single-digit annual expense growth. However, the current environment
poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program.
As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more
efficiently through staff reduction, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the
workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million. Onetime costs
associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth
quarter of 2023.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward. As a result, even though our
budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which, by definition,
would exclude the fourth quarter onetime charges.
In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're
expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We
expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024,
when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates.
Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows. We
expect the average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital
commitment facilities. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%. Fee income to be up approximately 1%, as
increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains
during the third quarter.
Other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa
activity. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the
workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment,
which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200
million and $250 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the – just regarding the office increase in non-performers that you discussed a bit, could you just give us a
little bit more detail? Is that more indicative of – did you see an acceleration in the deterioration of these credits
that were noteworthy in the quarter and that necessitated to move to non-accrual? Or was this more of a function
of a ongoing scrub of your portfolio as you're reevaluating collateral values or whatnot behind properties? And as
you do that as well, can you maybe talk about some of the value depreciation you're beginning to see on some
properties that have traded? Thanks
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I guess what I would say is, what you're seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit. So, our
criticized list didn't really move. We moved inside of that loans to non-performing. By the way, I think they're
actually all still accruing. We just kind of get there because we don't think they're refinanceable in the current
market. The move to non-performing from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates
creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly.
So, I don't – I mean, none of this is a surprise. We have heavy reserves against it. We kind of saw it coming. It's
the big bulk of these properties moving through the [indiscernible] (00:21:13)...

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We do expect losses, as I've said in my comments, but we believe that we're appropriately reserved
[indiscernible] (00:21:25).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And there's no – there's – it's not like there's some new scrubbing, John. I mean, we've been – we're live on
every one of these properties every day. So, it's not like we opened a drawer and found something. We know
exactly what each of these are [audio gap] (00:21:40-00:21:46).

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then separately on the expense side, could you maybe help us think about how the
$325 million you expect to fall to the bottom line from the head count rationalization, how that would impact the
growth rate that you expect overall for expenses in 2024 versus 2023? How should we think about that growth?

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, I mentioned in my opening comments when we walk down both the CIP that we anticipate
implementing in 2024, along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep 2024 expenses stable
year-over-year. We haven't completed our budget process. In fact, we're at the beginning of our budget process.
So, we don't have a lot of 2024 guidance for you other than that is our objective, and that will be our expectation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And, John, the other thing – the reason we kind of put the continuous improvement in there is, it's a number that
we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company. So, that's sort of what's been driving
our investment gain for the last bunch of years, and that continues. What's new is basically dropping the run rate
related to personnel and just tightening the ship in what is a tougher revenue environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Got it. I'm sorry, if I could ask just one more. On the Signature acquisition, of the Signature loans that is,
the $0.10 of accretion that you mentioned on that. Can you maybe just walk us through the components of that,
how you arrive with that amount?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, sure. That's basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased. We – they are short-term about a
year. So, we do expect that $0.10 a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into 2024. But
when we get to 2024, of course, we'll include that in our full year guidance.

business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And that's a program that we've had in place, as I mentioned, for several years and allows us to – and has
allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low single-digit range, even with all those investments. And in point of
fact, this year, we're pointing to 1% growth year-over-year, 2024 – or 2023 over 2022, and a large part of that is
because of our continuous improvement program.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And then if I could just ask you a follow-up question on the capital market fees. So, they came in
weaker than expected this quarter. You talked about, I think, stable versus the last quarter. One of your larger
peers reported stronger capital markets this morning. Can you just talk about the driver of this? Was it mostly mix
related? And then maybe touch on the outlook in the near term given the macro outlook is better than a few
months ago? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I didn't – I'm not sure what anybody else reported. My guess was that the trading line item was better than peer
fees. But in our case, the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from Harris
Williams or Solebury or syndications and so forth. And while the pipelines remain robust, if not at record levels,
the activity level, while there's been some green shoots just hasn't been strong. Eventually, it flows through, but
we're getting a little tired of predicting when it will be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But, yeah, I would add to that. Our capital markets is weighted towards our M&A advisory, Harris Williams. We
had a soft second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our pipelines were higher than the first quarter. So,
we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher, but it wasn't. So, we find ourselves at the end of the
third quarter with even higher pipeline than we had at the beginning of the quarter.

But inside of that subset of the pipeline are signed deals, which that part is higher than it was at this point last
quarter. So, we do expect to see the lift, and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels.

R. Scott Siefers Q

I wanted to ask sort of a broad question. Hey. Kind of a broad question on NII. Are we getting to a point where
that'll start to trough? So, maybe, Rob, just sort of some of the puts and takes. It seems like your deposit betas
are coming in as expected or better. I know there should be some asset re-pricing as we look into next year, but
some of the larger banks have been sort of vocal about the degree to which they're still over-earning on NII, which
I think has kind of kept these fears of still bleeding out NII alive sort of industry-wide. Maybe just some thoughts
on how you see things playing out for PNC in particular.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'll start.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
All of it ends up being dependent on what you think the Fed is going to do. Personally, I think the Fed is higher for
longer, even higher for longer than the market expects. On our official forecast, I guess, we have two cuts towards
the back at next year. As short rates stay higher, you will continue to see betas creep up, both because we're
going to re-price the back book; and secondly, because you'll just – not on betas, but just on the shift from non-
interest-bearing to interest-bearing.
So, when that inflection point is – has, in some ways, to do the most with what's going on with the yield curve and
the Fed, as the curve continues to flatten by the long end selling off, all else equal, that helps, notwithstanding the
marks on our existing bonds. It helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment. So, there's too
11


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
(PNC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
many variables in there. But the basic notion that we're at the inflection point I think is entirely dependent on what
happens with the Fed in the coming year. And we haven't done our budget yet, so we're not going to call it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I would just add to that just observations. Deposits continue to decline. We expected that, but that decline
is slowing. Betas have gone up, but the increase has slowed. In fact, in the third quarter, they came – actuals
came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly. So, things have
slowed as far as that trajectory is, and then obviously the inflection point issues that Bill just covered are valid.

Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Then maybe a question on credit as well. I guess there – just in the last few weeks,
there've been a couple commercial hiccups in the industry in the shared national credit space. Just – well,
something you might be able to remind us about PNC's exposure in this next phase. And then just generalization,
sort of how that portfolio quality compares to the rest of the book, how much you lead, et cetera.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Pretty good there. Pretty good there, Scott, in terms of credit. So, all of the noise, so to speak, is in the
commercial real estate office space that we spoke about. As far as the shared national credit results went, they're
complete. They're represented in our numbers. And it was pretty benign in terms of total deals. Upgrades were
more than downgrades, but they were a handful of each.

[ph] Partially offset by separation costs, in fact (00:30:53) – you guys gave us good color on the burn-off of the

guys doing with the cash flows from the portfolio now in terms of where you're putting it and other securities? And
then second, once the Basel III Endgame is finalized, how do you think you guys will approach in carrying your
securities? Will you carry less on available for sale or more? Can you share with us your thoughts there as well?

Just with the existing book, it's running down. We've run down the DV01 in our securities and swaps through the
course of the entire year. We've had some purchases, but not to the extent we've had maturities. And we've been
buying, I don't know what average yield is, but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it at the Fed.
Going forward, the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesn't really affect anything. It's an
accounting entry. So, we'll keep some amount in available for sale to the extent we trade around that book. But
we don't trade around that book all that much, and the rest will just buy in down the maturity, which is, by the way,
what we've been doing thus far since rates have gone up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. But there's a couple things to add there. One of the uses of cash, Gerard, was the purchase of the
Signature loans. So, that was our biggest outlay.

William Stanton Demchak A

Robert Q. Reilly A

Yeah. That was our biggest outlay. And then on the split, Bill had it right. Where we are now is probably about
where we are plus or minus to your views in terms of what – but the – where we got to holding it all to 100% of
AFS was the tailoring, which has passed us. So, we're back to sort of the normal split.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, you just mentioned about the purchase of the Signature loans. You guys are
in a good position that you're not being impacted by Basel III Endgame, RWA inflation, like some of the big money
centers, of course. Do you think there's going to be opportunities for you guys to buy other portfolios, not from the
FDIC per se, but from some of your peers or banks that do mitigation strategies to get to these RWA targets they
need to get to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Bill and Rob, wanted to follow-up on your office CRE comments. How much of an impact
to debt service coverage are PNC customers experiencing from swaps that are rolling off, say, in cases where
they issued floating rate debt underserved two to three years ago and put on swaps to lock in low fixed rates at
the time but are now facing a significant reset as those swaps mature? I'm just curious just how significant that
maturing swap dynamic is inside of the portfolio and whether you feel like you have a good handle on that
dynamic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't know the answer to that. I would tell you though, the bulk of our stuff, and you see it in our maturity
schedules, were kind of stabilization loans-ish, project loans. And so in that instance, the hedge dynamics of

somebody would put on that loan, in my experience, would be less than what they would have done on a term,
10-year CMBS alternative.
So, my guess is it's not – I think they're just in trouble for floating rate loans from lease rates going down, from
vacancies going up, and from the rehab costs of redoing floors.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could follow up on that, if refinancing loans at current market rates
would cause debt service coverage ratios to fall below 1, can you discuss how much leeway there is inside of
PNC to refinance loans under potentially more favorable terms to allow debt service coverage ratios to remain
satisfactory?
And then maybe just more broadly across the industry, do you think so-called extend and pretend dynamics could
become pervasive, particularly since banks have made it clear they don't want to own office buildings and we've
seen some commentary from regulators sort of urging banks to work with their customers?

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because that's ultimately going to
maximize value of our loan. In some instances, that means taking the building and selling it. In some instances,
that means getting more equity capital. Extending a loan at the service coverage ratio, we normally wouldn't under
the theory that they can lease it up themselves.
But each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on what's the net present value of what we
PNC can get against our loan. In any event, if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan,
that shows up, and our reserves or charge-offs or so on and so forth. There's no pretend involved.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's very helpful, Bill. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one last one on the point about whether
we're at an inflection point on deposit betas sort of depending on the Fed, there's a [ph] correlate to (00:37:59)
that suggest that we could see terminal beta expectations potentially drift higher relative to prior guidance, again,
depending on how much higher for longer persists?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think – and by the way, this isn't a forecast. I think it's just common sense, right? To the extent that we still have
a back book of business, as does everybody that hasn't necessarily repriced. And if rates are pinned at 5%
forever in time, that beta will continue to go up. It's a function of how high does the Fed go and how long do they
stay there, and everybody has been wrong so far. So, yeah, it's a possibility.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Troisi Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thanks very much for the disclosure on the long-term debt shortfalls in the slides. You talked about $10 billion
of debt issuance annually. But do you anticipate needing to issue more than $10 billion to close the shortfalls that
you disclosed in the slides? Or can the $8 billion shortfall at the bank be met just by restructuring existing internal
debt? And I guess the question really is, do you expect to issue debt at the holding company specifically to invest
in the internal debt of the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. This is Rob. So, a good question. So, in regard to the long-term debt, our message is independent of the
rules, as we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits, that was pre-
COVID, we would be compliant. So, that's the takeaway. In regard to how we get there, it's a combination of
everything that you outlined. There will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan, that will
then ultimately be [ph] tapered (00:40:15) down to the bank. But there's a lot of moving parts there. The message
is, we'll get there, and we would have gotten there independent of these rules.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, Bill, I was hoping you could just share your thoughts on the CFPB's
plans to propose an open banking rule. There's a view that open banking essentially forces the industry to hand
over the keys to the customer relationship. You've talked in the past about sort of the dynamic of, like, passwords
and all that kind of stuff. But I was just hoping you could speak broadly to that point or that topic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think what I've seen thus far out of CFPB commentary is they're largely focused on some of the right
things. Make it easier for customers, agree with that. Secure data, agree with that. Don't allow data to be sold and
commercialized without customer permission, agree with that. Make customers agree to specific data items that
they want to share in a secure environment. So, all of that stuff versus where we are today where it's a free-for-all
and there's a lot of fraud, actually I'm in favor of.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2023
The notion of kind of open banking where somehow I can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another
because now there's technology to do it, I'm not that afraid of that. It's more in the technology to allow it in a
secure manner, dependent of what rule is written, doesn't exist today. And I kind of look at what they're doing and
hope it's a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information leading to
a reduction in fraud across the industry. And I – the sound bites are, that's where they're going.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful. I had heard something along the lines of, some of the actions they're taking are intended to
make it easier for customers to "break up with their banks." And so I was wondering if there was anything in the
language. You mentioned how you're not worried about the ability to shift the relationship, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, at the end of the day – by the way, if that happened, terrific. We compete every day and we have good
customer service and great products. We'll be a net beneficiary. Practically, the technology to allow that to happen
– so just think about the notion of, okay, now you have connected APIs that allow somebody to gather information
and move information. Now you need to build a program that keeps tracking the back book while you open a new
book on a checking account, transfers, balances on cards. So, eventually somebody will come up with a cool
business model that might be able to do that on the back of [ph] laws (00:43:39) that allow it on the back of APIs
that haven't been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks in question together. But that hasn't
happened yet.

Well, none of it's deliberate per se. We've seen some drop in utilization. We've seen a drop in kind of refinance
rate as people are – if you think about a corporate loan revolver where it's a three-year, and every two years you
renew it for the next three years, everybody is kind of extending that under the hope that things are going to get
better on spreads. So, there's just been less activity.
At the margin, we are extending less credit into credit-only new relationships on the hope that we're going to get
fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get cross-sell. But that's kind of a...

Okay. And you're very clear about the expense guidance and the tough actions you're taking with personnel. Did
you give an outlook for operating leverage over next year? Do you think the pace of expense decline will be faster
than any decline in revenues? And specifically to the fourth quarter, the SBNY loan acquisition, looks like it adds a
couple percent to your fourth quarter NII, but you're guiding down 1% to 2%. So, that decline might be a little bit
more than some had expected. It's more than you had expected. The quarter decline looks like 2% to 4% in the
fourth quarter. Is that math correct? Why is it down maybe more than you thought? And the big question though
is, revenues versus expenses over the next year?

stable. And we haven't finished our budgeting cycle, so we can't really answer in terms of anything beyond that in
2024.
In regard to the NII in the fourth quarter guide, it does include the Signature acquisition, which we said was about
$0.10 a share. Recall in the third quarter, we had expected 3% to 5% decline. We ended up down 3%. So, when
we look to the fourth quarter, roll all that together, that's how we get down 1% to 2%.

Thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up on the Signature acquisition as well. So, just wondering if you can
provide a little more context on the portfolio, seeing the line that you're expecting to hold on to – or expecting to
hold on to 75% of the relationships over time. Are you bringing on new team members? Is there expenses along
with that? And just anything you can help us in terms of, like, the duration of the loans, and is there just kind of a
natural runoff that happens given, I think, that they're generally a pretty short duration type of loan? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. It's de minimis adds of people that we're bringing on. We're already in the business. We have the
technology to be in the business. We know the clients. The rundown, we're kind of saying at 75% probably
survives. Most of that is simply a function of where we have overlapped with clients and the size hold that we'd
want to have for a particular client. We'd syndicate more of it as we kind of right-size our hold.
There may be inside of that book of business a handful of people that we would choose not to renew. But their
credit quality is pristine. We underwrote every fund that is in that. And through time, you would expect that as they
mature, we'll renew. In some period of time out a couple years, we'll end up with 75% of the notional that we
started with, then you'll have no clue between now and then how much it was. Yeah.

Completely understood. The second question I had, Bill, is, you mentioned in a higher [ph] long-term (00:49:11)
environment, we got to see what the Fed does in terms of where deposit betas and mix goes. On the asset side,
however, though, can you help us understand what happens in terms of fixed rate loan repricing versus – and
how much you might still have left in that versus obviously when we get to a peak, and Fed funds will know that
the variable rates will have gotten there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

several years, we have – I don't know the percentage off the top of my head – percentage of our loan book, either
fixed rate to begin with – think of an auto loan or with swaps on top of it. Floating rate loan, we swapped to fixed.
And those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book, and
there's a lot of dry powder there that will reprice.
We are back to this notion that, hey, we're out there competing and growing this company. We will be originating
those loans as they reprice. We're not dumping assets and getting out of things. It's going to shrink the total
volume that's on our book.

Yeah. No. I totally understand. I would think it would be a net positive as an offset to [ph] whatever that's
happening (00:50:35).

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, it will be [ph] close (00:50:36). I mean, you have the competing parts, right? We're going to have repricings of
fixed rate assets fighting reprices of our liabilities. At some point, that's going to cross, and banks are going to
grow NII at high percentages. I just can't tell you when that is yet, and we haven't done our budget next year.
