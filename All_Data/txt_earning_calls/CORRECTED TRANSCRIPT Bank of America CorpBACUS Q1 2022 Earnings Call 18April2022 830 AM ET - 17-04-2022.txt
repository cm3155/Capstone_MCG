MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America Earnings Announcement. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-
and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning. Thank you, Katherine. Welcome. I hope everybody had a nice weekend, and thank you for joining
the call to review the first quarter results. I trust everybody had a chance to review our earnings release
documents. As always, they're available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this
call, on our Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our
CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the
details of the quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer
to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. These forward-looking statements are based on management's
current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause
actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that
are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US
GAAP, can also be found in the earnings materials that are available on the website.
So, with that, take it away, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us. As we open our earnings call this
quarter, we want to acknowledge that there's the humanitarian crisis continuing to take place in Ukraine, and we
remain watchful and have provided assistance from our company to the Ukrainian citizens and stand ready to
help further where we can.
Before we get into some discussion on the current outlook and activity, I want to step back and focus on the big
picture about Bank of America this quarter. In a quarter that had a lot of variables show up, we delivered
responsible growth again. We reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.80 per diluted share. We grew revenue, we
reduced costs and we delivered our third straight quarter of operating leverage coming out of the pandemic.
Net interest income grew 13% and is expected to grow significantly from here. We saw strong loan growth. We
grew deposits. We saw strong investment flows. We made trading profits every day during the quarter. We grew
pre-tax pre-provision income by 8%. We had a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%. All this came in a
quarter that saw geopolitical conflict, rising interest rates, the pandemic, rising inflation concerns and much, much
more. I want to thank our team for delivering on responsible growth once again.

So, as you look at the statistics on slide 2, you can see some of those highlights. You can see the organic growth
engine that our company is delivering once again. In our Banking business, you can see the strong loan and
deposit growth. We grew and expanded customer relationships across every business. In fact, we grew net new
checking accounts by more than 220,000 this quarter alone. We opened new financial centers and we renovated
many others. We added more digital capabilities and crossed 50% in digital sales.
In our Wealth Management businesses, you can see over $160 billion of client flows over the year and more than
$4 trillion in client balances including Merrill Edge. We saw both strong investment flow performance in addition to
banking flows. Over the past year, we brought on a significant number of net new households, 24,000 in the
Merrill and another 2,000 in the Private Bank. Across the combination of our Consumer and Wealth businesses,
we saw more than $90 billion of investment flows. We've now had managed client balances including deposits
and loan investments of more than $5 trillion with us.
In Global Markets, Jimmy DeMare and his team had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, which included a
record quarter for equities. And despite the market turmoil, we had zero days trading losses. While the investment
banking fee line was down from the record quarters of the past year, Matthew Koder and his team put in solid
results with a strong forward pipeline, and we gained market share in several areas, including moving to number
two in mid-cap investment banking.
From a broader enterprise perspective, part of managing costs well comes from the drive we have in the company
to provide enhanced digital capabilities to our customers, which in turn drives adoption, further digital engagement
and lower cost. If you look at slide 23 and beyond, you can see we are now selling more digitally than we are in-
person. It takes both to be successful. What makes it even more impressive is all the financial centers are now
open and back to operating at their usual great capacity. So, adding the digital capacity clearly increases our total
production capabilities.
You could also see our digital sales are now twice the pre-pandemic level just three years ago. Even more
impressive, look at Zelle and Erica volumes up more than 4 times from the pre-pandemic levels. We're now
processing more outgoing Zelle transactions than checks. In our CashPro mobile app for the Commercial clients,
we see many $5 billion usage days. There are a lot more stats on those slides showing strong digital growth. I
[indiscernible] (00:05:33) you to see how a high-touch, high-tech innovative company drives organic growth.
This quarter, our resilience was tested, and once again, we maintained a focus on what we can control and grew
responsibly and earned our way through the turmoil. So, we talked to you during the quarter. Many of you
expressed questions about the impact of the macro environment and changes in our company; the lingering
impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunities; inflation and Fed reduction of monetary
accommodation; the impacts of the Russian-Ukraine war both on the first-order effect and second-order effects.
We do remain mindful of all these. So, could a slowdown in the economy happen? Perhaps. But right now, the
size of the economy is bigger than pre-pandemic levels, consumer spending remains strong, unemployment is
low and wages are rising.
Company earnings are also generally strong. Credit is widely available, and our customers' uses of their lines of
credit is still low, i.e., they have capacity to borrow more. We are all focused on the ability of the Fed to use their
tools to reduce inflation. We all know that will take interest rate hikes and a reduction in the balance sheet. We
predict it will slow the economy from 3% growth in 2022 to a little below 2% in 2023. That is back to track. So, with
interest rate hikes comes better NII. Does the Fed have to push harder to slow inflation? Perhaps. That is why we
run stress tests each quarter to look at scenarios to see what would happen in a highly inflationary environment.

If rates move up fast, are there implications to capital? Sure, and you saw some this quarter. But in the context of
the capital built, those impacts are manageable. The impact increases earnings also, and then over time, the
bonds pull back to par. All that results in a rebuild of the capital quite quickly. But for some short period of time,
that capital usage along with customer usage might slow share repurchases a bit, but it will be temporary. What if
we're wrong and things do get tough? We already know what that looks like. In 2020, as we built significant
reserves, we also built 90 basis points of capital during the economic shutdown period. Rates moved against us
and earnings fell. So, we have already proven resilience. We continue to focus on responsible growth and the
things we control.
If you go to slide 3, I want to mention â€“ show some of the strengths we see in our US consumer base. Bank of
America consumers spent at the highest ever quarter one level, which is a double-digit percentage increase over
the 2021 level that you can see in the upper left. From our card spend data, we have seen a strong recovery in
travel, entertainment and restaurant spending. In the upper right, you can see that. By the way, even with fuel
costs up 40% or more from last year, fuel represents about 6% of overall debit and credit card spending and a lot
less of overall spending, as cards you can see in the lower left is 21% of all spending.
Importantly, despite March of last year including the stimulus bonus, we saw the spending in the month of March
2022 on a comparable basis to 2021 13% higher by dollar volume, and we saw a 7.4% increase in the number of
transactions. So, both dollar volumes and numbers of transactions rose nicely. And as you expect, the methods
by which people spend continues to shift away from cash and checks and replaced with digital alternatives, and
you can see that below.
Our data shows continued growth in the average deposit balance across all customer levels, which suggests
capacity for strong spending continuing. On an aggregated basis, average deposit balances were up 47% from
pre-pandemic levels and 15% higher than 2021. And the momentum continued through quarter one, particularly in
the low balance account, which grew in February to March, continuing a streak since mid last year.
Now, a couple of examples, so you can see how this works. We looked at the pre-pandemic customers who had
$1,000 to $2,000 of cleared balance with BAC. Today, they had an â€“ at that time pre-pandemic, they had an
average balance of $1,400. If you take that same cohort of customers, the same customers in 2022 versus 2019,
and they have an average cleared balance now of $7,400. So, an increase from $1,400 to $7,400. If you go to the
next cohort up, those with $2,000 to $5,000 of cleared balances in the pre-pandemic, their average was $3,250.
Now, those same customers today have an average cleared balance of $12,500.
What does that tell us? The consumers are sitting on lots of cash. Why is this true? Well, you know high wage
growth, high savings by limited enabled spending, but what it means is there's a long tail to consumer spend
growth. And in April through the first two weeks, spending is growing even faster at 18% over April of 2021.
Another economic signpost is the continuation of loan growth. A year ago, we highlighted the green shoots of our
loan growth. We then delivered growth in quarter two and quarter three and quarter four despite PPP runoff and
the changing economic conditions. To convey where we are today, we focus on ending loans to give you a
progression through the quarter. If you go to slide 4, you can see the highlights of that growth in the upper left of
the slide.
I would remind you that in quarter four, we highlighted to you that of the $55 billion of growth in that single quarter,
$16 billion was Global Markets and we did not expect that to hold true for quarter one of 2022. So, as we thought,
Global Markets did come down $5 billion this quarter. Despite that, overall commercial loans grew $13 billion from
quarter four excluding PPP. That means commercial loans excluding Global Markets grew $17 billion. Every
single customer group, Global Banking, large corporate, middle market, business banking grew, as well as

commercial loans in Wealth Management. That improvement came from both new loans as well as improving
utilization rates from existing clients.
You can see in the top chart, loans have moved back above our pre-pandemic levels on the right-hand side of the
slide, and you can see it being led by Commercial. Consumer loans continued to grow linked quarter as well. This
is despite typical seasonality and despite the continued suppressed credit card balances you can see in the lower
left. Mortgage loans grew $4 billion. Originations remained at high levels and pay-downs declined. Card loans
declined $2 billion from quarter four, driven by the transfer of $1.6 billion [ph] that's in the card (00:12:21) loan
portfolio to the held-for-sale category. Absent that transfer, card loans would have declined very modestly,
whereas in previous quarter one quarters, they've declined several billion.
On slide 5, we provide data around Consumer clients' leverage and asset qualities compared to pre-pandemic
periods, which further supports our belief that Consumer remains in good shape. On the upper left, we looked at
our customers that had both a credit card and a deposit account with us. As you will note, the average card
balance of our credit card customers that had deposit relationships are still 8% lower than they were pre-
pandemic. They continued to pay down their balances on a monthly basis at a higher rate than pre-pandemic, and
as you know, delinquency rates are significantly lower.
Further, as you can see to my earlier point, these borrowing customers have built significant additional savings
and their average deposit balances are up 39%. So, a lot of strength or dry powder as it's called. So, what if we
went to the modest FICO â€“ more modest amount of low FICO customers we have at BAC? Looking at that small
subset of our base, you see a similar trend, even stronger on cash balances and lower debt levels. And you see it
in the bottom charts. We believe this is not just a phenomenon at BAC as industry data points around debt service
levels are hovering near historic lows and household deposit and cash levels are $3 trillion higher than we
entered the crisis.
Now, a word on Russia. This is not an area of material direct exposure for Bank of America. More than a decade
ago, we reduced our exposure in Russia and it has resulted in having 90% less before the most recent crisis. Our
current very limited activities in Russia are focused on compliance with all sanctions and other legal and
regulatory requirements. Our lending and counterparty exposure to companies based in Russia totals
approximately $700 million and is limited to nine Russian-based borrowers. It is largely comprised of top tier
commodity exporters with a history of strong cash flows who continue to make payments. Prior to the Ukraine
invasion, these exposures were mostly investment grade. We report all of them on our reservable criticized.
Our quarter one allowance includes increased reserves for this direct exposure, and I'd just note that even with
the addition of these loans to reservable criticized, we still declined $1.7 billion in this category during the first
quarter. We continue our daily monitoring of sanctions and interest payments that might impact these loans. We
also evaluate our portfolios and continue to do so considering second-order impacts of this crisis. Currently, we
believe this to be modest and reflect our international strategy to focus on large multinational clients that have
geographically diverse operations. Our quarter one allowance for credit losses reflects all of these things as well.
On Russian counterparty risk, our teams have done a tremendous job [ph] in managing (00:15:09) down our
exposures, and at the end of the quarter, we had de minimis, meaning less than $20 million, counterparty
exposure with a single Russian-based counterparty, and very limited impacts from [indiscernible] (00:15:20)
impacts in our trading results for this quarter. So, responsible growth has served us well here, and as you might
note, after the 2014 Crimea conflict, we intentionally reduced our exposure and Russia has not been in our top 20
country risk exposure table since 2015.

So, a few comments on NII. On NII, remember the rate increases came late in the quarter and had little first
quarter 2022 NII impact. And there were two fewer days of interest in the quarter and decreased PPP fees [ph]
hurt (00:15:53) NII growth. Yet, we still grew NII by $200 million in line with our guidance we gave you last
quarter. Given the forward curve expectation for higher interest rates and our expectations of further loan growth,
we expect significant NII improvement through the next several quarters. Alastair will expand on this point for you.
We have more than $2 trillion of deposits and $1.4 trillion of those are with our Consumer and Wealth
Management clients with more than 40% of those in low to no interest checking. That is a franchise that isn't
viable. We will benefit as the rates move off the zero floors, allowing us to earn more money on those checking
deposits.
On deposits, I know several of you are wondering if deposits continue to grow as rates begin to rise. So, we went
back and looked at the last rate rising cycle in the last decade. We pinpointed the peak rate paid to customers
during the quarter reflective of the peak Fed tightening. We then went back and looked at the 12 months
preceding growth rate in deposits. In effect, during that 12 months preceding that peak, deposits grew 5%, driven
by organic growth engine, our market share gains and overall economic growth.
If you go to page â€“ slide 6, you can see the common equity â€“ [ph] we'll talk about (00:17:10) capital. Just to start
off, our capital remains strong with 10.4% CET1 ratio well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. As you can see,
$7 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, generate 41 basis points of capital. As you look on the right-hand
side of the page, you can see that 14 basis points of that capital was used to support our customers growth.
That's a good thing. We also returned $4 billion to shareholders in common dividends and share repurchase, will
represent about 27 basis points of use.
The spike in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to
decrease and lowered our CET1 by 21 basis points. That's the part that goes to the calculation of the capital.
While one wouldn't expect this impact every quarter, we're well-positioned â€“ we were well-positioned for the spike.
As you recall, we've invested much of our securities books in held-to-maturity due to our huge excess in stable
deposit base. We have $2 trillion of deposits and less than $1 trillion in loans.
In addition, to be cautious, we hedge a large portion of securities in the AFS portfolio, protecting it from much
larger hit to AOCI. I'll remind you as the securities mature, the AOCI reverses and the higher rates result in higher
NII over a relatively short period of time. That should result in higher earnings that will benefit CET1 ratios on an
ongoing basis and more than offset the negative upfront AOCI impacts.
The last thing I would note is our balance sheet growth to support our customer means our G-SIB buffer will
probably move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024, i.e., to 10% regulatory minimums. While this is nearly
two years away, we continue to move towards it. Given this new higher minimum, over the next couple of years,
we'll look to gradually move to target CET1 range of 10.75%, towards 11%. Importantly, while we grow into this
range, we'll be able to support our clients, we'll be able to continue to increase our dividends, and we'll be able to
continue to buy back stock.
With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and I'll start with the summary income statement on slide 7, where you can see our
comparisons illustrating 3% year-over-year operating leverage produced by growing revenue and managing our
7

costs well. That was nearly enough to overcome the change in provision expense driven by the $2.7 billion
reserve release in the year-ago period compared to a $400 million release this quarter. On asset quality more
broadly, we continue to see very strong metrics. Net charge-offs remained low, and in fact, they're down more
than 50% in just the past year. Consumer early and late stage delinquencies are still below 2019 levels, and
reservable criticized moved lower again in Q1.
Looking ahead, we continue to feel good about the asset quality results of our Consumer and Commercial
businesses near term, given our customers' high liquidity, low unemployment and rising wages. We produced
good returns again this quarter with an ROTCE of nearly 16% and we delivered $4.4 billion of capital back to
shareholders, driving average shares lower by 6% year-over-year. Looking forward and with continued
expectations of growing NII, combined with strong expense control, we expect to drive operating leverage and
see our efficiency ratio work back towards 60%.
Let's turn to slide 8 and the balance sheet, and you can see, during the quarter, our balance sheet grew $69
billion to a little more than $3.2 trillion. This reflected $14 billion of growth in loans and the growth of our Global
Markets balance sheet as customers increased their activity with us. A decline in cash this quarter was associated
with that growth in Global Markets. Our liquidity portfolio was stable compared to year-end, and at $1.1 trillion, it
represents roughly a third of the balance sheet.
Shareholders' equity declined $3.4 billion from Q4 with a few different components I would note. Shareholders'
equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $6.6 billion, as well as issuance of $2.4 billion in
preferred stock. So, that's $9 billion that flowed into equity in Q1. And we paid out $4.4 billion in common
dividends and share repurchases. AOCI declined as a result of the spike in loan rates that Brian referenced, and
we saw the impact in two ways.
First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities. That was $3.4 billion. That's the
piece that impacts CET1, as Brian noted. And second, rates also drove a $5.2 billion decline in AOCI from
derivatives that does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges against our variable rate loans, which
provide some NII growth and protected CET1 at the same time.
With regard to regulatory capital, since Brian already talked about CET1, I'd simply note that our supplemental
leverage ratio was stable at 5.4% versus the minimum requirement of 5% and still leaves us plenty of capacity for
balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.
Turning to slide 9, we included the schedule on average loan balances, and in the interest of time, the only thing I
would add to Brian's earlier comments, and for your perspective, is simply a reminder that PPP loans are down
$19 billion year-over-year. There's just a few billion of those left. And excluding PPP, our total loans grew $89
billion or 10% compared to last year.
Moving to deposits on slide 10, first, let's look at year-over-year growth. And across the past 12 months, we saw
solid growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts. Our year-over-
year average deposits are up $240 billion or 13%. Retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management
businesses grew $190 billion. And our retail deposits have now grown to more than $1.4 trillion, where we lead all
competitors.
Looking at linked quarter growth from Q4 and combining Consumer and Wealth Management customer balances,
our retail deposits grew $53 billion in just the past 90 days. With our Commercial clients, they're up nicely year-
over-year, and we simply note the Q1 decline, which is entirely consistent with previous year's seasonal trends.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Turning to slide 11 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $11.6 billion, and the FTE
NII number was $11.7 billion. So, I'll focus on FTE, where net interest income has now increased $1.4 billion from
the first quarter last year. As Brian noted, that's 13% increase, driven by deposits growth and our related
investment of liquidity. NII was up $200 million versus the fourth quarter, as the benefits of lower premium
amortization and loans growth more than offset the headwinds of two less days of interest accruals and lower
PPP fees.
So, let's pause for a moment to discuss asset sensitivity, because I want to make a couple of points as we begin
what the Fed has signaled to be a significant rate hike period. Remember, asset sensitivity is our measure of NII
for the next 12 months above an expected baseline of NII, given changes in interest rates and other assumptions.
In an environment of sharply rising rates each quarter, the baseline of NII â€“ actual NII increases, and therefore,
the future sensitivity declines.
Now, we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates
above the forward curve, and on that basis, asset sensitivity at March 31 was $5.4 billion of expected NII over the
next 12 months. And 90% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. That $5.4 billion is down from $6.5 billion at
year-end, largely because higher rates are now factored into and running through our actual or baseline NII.
Now, you asked the question last quarter about the same sensitivity on a spot basis relative to our current curve.
And given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next three meetings, we thought
it was appropriate to provide that disclosure. So, in a 100 basis point shock, to the current curve using spot rates,
our sensitivity to that kind of move would be $6.8 billion or $1.4 billion higher than on a forward basis. So,
assuming rising rates as reflected in today's forward curve, and if we see continued loans growth, I would just
reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021.
We're not going to provide numerical guidance for the full year, because the changes in interest rates have
proven quite volatile in just the last 90 days, let alone a year. We do provide that asset sensitivity so that you can
use it as guardrails to think about changes as you modify your own assumptions. I do however want to provide a
nearer term expectation and say that if loans grow and rates in the forward curve materialize, we would expect to
see NII in Q2 increase by more than $650 million over the Q1 level and then grow again significantly on a
sequential basis in each of the following two quarters.
Okay. Let's turn to expenses, and we'll use slide 12 for that discussion. Our Q1 expenses were $15.3 billion,
down a couple hundred million from the year ago period. I'll focus my remarks on the more recent comparison
versus Q4 where we're up $600 million. And as expected and we conveyed to you last quarter, the Q1 increase
was driven mostly by seasonality of payroll tax expense of roughly $400 million. We also experienced modestly
higher wage and benefit costs.
As we look forward, we continue to invest heavily in technology, people and marketing across our lines of
business, and we've continued to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. We modestly
increased our full year new tech initiative budget for the year to $3.6 billion, and that's on top of more than $35
billion that we put to work over the past 12 years to help us build powerful, more secure and scalable technology
platforms. This is the investment that's allowed us to maintain a leadership position in patents than some of our
peers. We had 512 of them granted in 2021, and we're maintaining a similar pace this year. We think this is one of
the things that's helping us to protect our moat around leadership positions in places that matter most to
customers.

In addition to modestly higher marketing costs this year, our investments also include adding up to 100 new
financial centers and we also plan to renovate more than 800 more during the year. We will also continue our
upward march on minimum hourly wage toward $25 by 2025.
So how do we pay for all that? Through continued work on operational excellence and digital engagement. And as
we look to Q2, we expect our expenses to be down modestly from Q1 as much of the seasonal payroll tax
expense abates and is somewhat offset by investment timing, inflation and the costs of opening up more fully for
travel and client entertainment because it feels like we've got a lot of pent-up demand for face-to-face meetings by
our clients and our people.
So, let's turn to asset quality on slide 13. And as you can see, asset quality of our customers remains very
healthy. Net charge-offs this quarter were better than our expectations once again and remained below $400
million, down 52% compared to Q1 2021. Provision expense was $30 million in Q1 as reserve release of $362
million closely matched net charge-offs in the quarter. And that reserve release was primarily in our Consumer
portfolios.
On slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. And I'm
happy to answer any questions later, but a couple things are worth repeating. Consumer delinquencies remain
well below pre-pandemic levels, and despite reporting our Commercial Russian lending exposure in reservable
criticized, those levels still declined $1.7 billion from Q4. NPLs saw a modest increase, and that simply reflects a
small amount of Consumer real estate deferrals expiring with the expiration of the CARES Act.
Turning to the business segments, one thing we'd ask you just to keep in mind for each of the businesses is Q1
expense includes the seasonal payroll tax expense, which has negatively impacted efficiency ratios or profit
margins in Q1. Also, and as usual, Q1 of every year includes segment capital level evaluation, and you'll note we
put additional capital against each of the businesses due to their growth. And as usual, we've tried to include
business trends and digital stats for each segment.
So let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 15, where you can see the Consumer Bank earned nearly $3 billion.
That's 11% up over Q1 2021 as revenue growth more than offset the larger prior period reserve release. It's
probably most easily identified by looking at pre-tax pre-provision earnings, which grew 32% year-over-year.
Revenue grew 9% on NII improvement and expense declined 4%, creating 13% operating leverage and the fourth
consecutive quarter of operating leverage for our Consumer team.
Notable customer activity highlights included our 228,000 net new checking accounts opened in Q1, which
represents our thirteenth consecutive quarter of net new Consumer checking account growth. Now, this occurred
as we began to implement our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, which
lowered our service charges about $80 million. So, during this time, we saw accounts grow and we saw expenses
decline. We also grew investment accounts 7%. And we saw those balances grow 10% from Q1 2021 to $350
billion, and that included $20 billion of client flows. And once again, we opened nearly 1 million credit cards in the
quarter and grew average active card accounts and saw growth in combined credit and debit spend of 15%.
Our continued investment in digital capabilities drove activity with our customers as we crossed 50% in digital
sales this quarter, and we continued investment in our financial centers opening another eight in the quarter. It's
also worth noting that Small Business saw continued growth in loans, in deposits and in spending. Small Business
card spend was up 28% year-over-year. Gives you an idea of how Small Businesses are reopening for business.

I'd also draw your attention to slide 22 in the appendix. We've shared this with you previously, and it simply
highlights the origination strength and quality of our Consumer underwriting. Throughout everything, our
underwriting standards have remained consistent.
Moving to slide 16, Wealth Management produced strong results, earning $1.1 billion, and that represented 28%
year-over-year growth, driven by strong revenue improvement, good expense management and low credit costs.
Bank of America continues to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of our client segments and
with the best advisors in the industry according to Barron's rankings. That, coupled with our digital leadership, is
delivering a modern Merrill and a modern Private Bank for clients with enterprise relationships. And our clients
and advisors have recognized the value in a holistic financial relationship that extends across investments,
planning and banking. And that's what helped drive the $150 billion of clients balance flows that you see here over
the past 12 months.
Not only did we see strong investment flows of more than $70 billion, but deposits grew $59 billion, up 18%, and
we added $22 billion in loans over the same period, marking our 48th consecutive quarter of average loans
growth in the business, just consistent and sustained performance from the team.
Revenues grew 10% to a new record and were led by 25% growth in NII on the back of those solid deposit and
loans increases as well as a 9% improvement in asset management fees. Expenses increased 4%, driven by
higher revenue-related costs, and resulted in over 600 basis points of operating leverage. And we generated
nearly 7,000 net new households in Merrill and more than 800 in the Private Bank this quarter.
Moving to Global Banking on slide 17. The business momentum with our Commercial clients remains strong in
the first quarter. The business earned $1.7 billion in Q1, down $450 million year-over-year, driven by the absence
of a large prior-period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. Revenue improvement of 12%
year-over-year reflected higher leasing-related revenue and NII growth, partially offset by those lower investment
banking fees. Net interest income grew on the back of strong loans and deposits growth. And the leasing revenue
improvement included more ESG-related investments, particularly in solar, as well as the absence of weather-
related losses recorded last year.
While the company's overall investment banking fees of $1.5 billion declined 35% year-over-year, we gained
market share in some important areas and recorded a number three ranking in overall fees. And importantly, our
investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.
Provision expense reflected a reserve build of $177 million compared to $1.2 billion release in the year-ago
period, and this quarter's provision includes reserves taken for Russia exposure and other considerations for
loans growth, offset by continued improvement in asset quality metrics. Finally, we saw expense decline by 4%,
driving strong operating leverage.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 18. And as we usually do, I will talk about the segment results excluding
DVA. Q1 net income of $1.5 billion reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue, and it includes a new
record for equities. The business generated a 15% return in Q1 even with a 12% increase in the capital allocated
to the business. Our investments in this business saw good results as our financing clients continue to increase
their activities with our company.
Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.7 billion to revenue. Versus Q4, that was a 58%
improvement, a little higher than typical seasonality. And versus Q1 2021, we saw a decline of 8%, as the prior
year included higher commodities results due to weather-related events. FICC declined 19%, while equities
11

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
improved 9%. That FICC decline reflects the higher prior period commodities and a weaker credit trading
environment, and it was partially offset by improved performance across our macro products, especially rates and
foreign exchange. The strength in equities was driven by strong performance in derivatives. And year-over-year
expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business
activity to the All Other unit as well as some Q1 2021 accelerated cost for incentive changes. Absent those
impacts, expenses were up modestly.
Finally, on slide 19, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $364 million, declining $620 million from the year-
ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and therefore higher
partnership losses on ESG investments. And this is partially offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit.
Expense increased as a result of costs, now recorded here in this segment, following the Q4 realignment of that
liquidating business out of Global Markets.
And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on
a standard fully taxable equivalent basis. So, in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and
any other unusual items.
For the quarter for the company, our effective tax rate was 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits. And
excluding the tax credits, the tax rate would have been roughly 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to
be between 10% to 12%, absent any tax law changes or any unusual items.
And with that, let's open it up, please, for Q&A.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. And forgive me if this is a drop long. But listening to all your comments about the
Consumer, about spending, about no real stresses in credit, net charge-offs, nonperformings, debt service levels,
all that sounds great. And in the past, I think higher rates were designed to pull leverage from the system and
caused some recessions. And so, the market is trying to assign some percentage chance towards a recession,
yet every comment I hear out of your mouth doesn't sound like we're going towards a recession. So I wanted to
see if I could, A, get you to comment on your thoughts around today's environment versus history, and then also
specifically ask what you did with the ins and outs in reserves and if you've changed any macro scenarios as you
bake in CECL reserves. Thanks for that, and thanks for bearing with me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. So, you're right to pick up on the commentary, because Brian is highlighting the strength of the
Consumer, which remains extraordinary. And at the same time, what we see on the asset quality side of
Commercial is just continued steady improvement as the economy reopens. So, that's what we're seeing. That's
contemporaneous.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Now, you're asking a question about what does it look like in the future, and we're obviously aware of what the
Fed is trying to engineer. So, going through this, every quarter, as we always do, we have an opportunity to think
about how we look at our reserves. And this quarter, we took some of the upside out. We've got a little more
weightings towards a baseline, a little more towards downside. So, that's one thing we've done. Second thing
we've done is we've upped our forecast for inflation. So, we see that flowing through, and those scenarios are a
little more weighted towards inflationary. And third, we have adjusted GDP growth down largely based on blue
chip consensus. So we, like you, are looking at two things. Number one, we're looking at what we're seeing in the
actual results; and number two, we're thinking about how we balance that going forward with our scenarios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Glenn, I think just generally, the Fed has a task to bringing inflation out of the system, and our GDP assumptions
by Candace Browning-Platt and her team are for the economy to slow its growth rate from this year to the next
year. The question of great debate is a soft landing, hard landing, et cetera, but I think what's unusual this time is
how much cash is sitting in the consumers' accounts.
If you and I are sitting here when they start normalizing rates in the middle of the last decade â€“ late to middle last
decade, you wouldn't have seen the consumer balances sitting with those multiples I gave you earlier in their
accounts and then having tremendous borrowing capacity left in terms of unused credit lines. And same on the
Commercial side, lines are bouncing along just above the low point.
And so, we continue to adjust our reserve levels to, as Alastair said, to factor in our base case includes higher
inflation through the rest of the year and to next year. Our [ph] seats (00:44:54) reserves set by that base case,
which is a 40% weighting to adverse, frankly equal maybe 40% of the actual reserves we have because the rest
are judgmental and [ph] imprecision (00:45:11) and things like that. So, we're very strongly reserved, and we're
very mindful of that.
I think it's very different to think about the situation where the consumers â€“ the unemployment is already so low
and the consumers are sitting on money, and I think that puts more tension on the Fed to architect a successful
change, and they know that. But on the other hand, it's a better place to start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate all that. One little, tiny follow-up is, in Global Banking, I noticed $2 billion more allocated capital. Deal
activity is down, but you mentioned pipelines are good, so maybe you could just talk about just what's going on
there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we don't have a great deal to add there. Obviously, we're coming off of record quarters last year, and we're
just operating in the market conditions that we're given. The volatility has obviously been hardest felt in equity
capital markets and in high yield. And across the board, we'd say our pipelines look very strong. So I think when I
asked Matthew, he said somewhere between strong and very strong, so that should tell you everything you need
to know. But obviously we need market conditions to cooperate.

Operator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about expenses and operating leverage. Are you
still thinking that expenses will be flattish this year in the $60 billion ballpark, Brian? And you did mention
expectations for the efficiency ratio as your operating leverage improves with NII, maybe that marches down from
kind of the mid-60s to low-60s I think you said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. And Alastair gave you some detail, but just simply put, John, we expect it to be relatively flat for 2022
versus 2021. That's the guide we gave you last quarter, and we don't see anything different this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. That's helpful. And then, Alastair, maybe just a little more fleshing out about the capital and how you're
managing the CET1. Obviously, you're generating already capital each quarter above what you're paying out the
dividend. It seemed like 30 basis points this quarter, and that probably gets better. At the same time, it sounds like
you're maybe going to manage up to around 11% over the next year. Maybe you can just give us some of the
dynamics there and how that plays into the ability to do some buybacks through the rest of the year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, no change to our approach, John, relative to prior years. I think the waterfall that we laid out in slide 6 is
pretty constructive. First priority for us will remain just invest in growth, we'll support our clients and let them get
after â€“ the teams get after the loans to help our clients there. Second will be we'll make the dividend payments.
And then we'll have capital left over for share buyback as we have had in the past. And we'll make those
decisions in the context of future rate environments and future capital requirements. I think Brian pointed out to
you that we're going to build capital over the course of the next couple years by about 50 basis points. We've got
seven quarters, so it's a small amount every quarter that we'll be doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And, John, you said operating leverage. I'm proud of the team. We have three straight quarters of operating
leverage. PPNR growth was strong. That's different than what we've seen out there generally. But remember,
during â€“ as the rates rose in the pre-pandemic setting and Glenn's question about soft landing, hard landing
inherently weighs on everybody's mind, the simple fact is we had 20 straight quarters of operating leverage and
we're starting to see that come through. And if you look at the Consumer efficiency from the first quarter last year
to this quarter [ph] you pointed to the (00:49:20) efficiency ratio, this has all come through NII and all falls to the
bottom line; and therefore, you end up with a fairly significant impact to those businesses, which are obviously
[ph] highly sensitive to (00:49:29) growth in NII.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Brian and Alastair, I wondered if you can ask just make a distinction between the economic, regulatory and
accounting outlook. So, from the economic standpoint, you're marking to market your assets and your securities
and you saw a swing to AOCI, but you don't mark-to-market that $1.4 billion of deposits. From a regulatory
standpoint, AOCI causes you to slow buybacks, I believe you said. But from an accounting or earnings
standpoint, maybe you win in the end, maybe you don't.
So I know you're not giving specific guidance for NII. But just at a basic level, is your guys' earnings outlook better
because of the NII and the higher payment rates and the better efficiency, or is it worse because you have less
buybacks, maybe more provisions due to the potential for a recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Mike, those are all the pieces. But simply put, I think Alastair said NII pick up next quarter. So, you pick up the
$200 million this quarter, you put that in the bank, then you pick up another $600 million-plus next quarter and
then it grows from there out. So, yes, that's tremendous operating leverage. And as we just said to John, the
expenses are flat. So, that flows through the bottom line.
All the different vagaries of not only regulatory accounting versus GAAP accounting, but also what [ph] counts in
the (00:51:10) capital ratio calculations versus not, at the end of the day, you said $1.4 trillion â€“ $2 trillion of
deposits, $1.4 trillion just on the â€“ for people side of the business. And even on the business side, we only have
operational deposits. And so, at the end of the day, those are very long deposits. We extract the value through
investing, and that's why we put it in held-to-maturity. And the cash flow off that held-to-maturity portfolio is $20-
odd billion a quarter, even when the rate environment changes.
So, whatever hit we had to CET1, the growth in NII and the growth in earnings power covers up this side of the
year. And so, we feel very good about that. So, a rate environment where we come off the zero floors makes us a
lot more money. You know that and we know that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by operational deposits? I know you've talked about that
and the linkages and, I guess, that's the reason why you would expect deposits to be more sticky. But can you
elaborate a little bit more? You mentioned that Zelle and Erica volumes were up four times higher than pre-
pandemic. So, I guess, you have a little bit more lock-in. But if you can just elaborate more.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
On the Consumer side, you have people, meaning Wealth Management consumers and general consumers. Of
the $1.4 trillion, we're 40% or more in checking accounts. And that's the money people have in motion in a given
day. And what the big volume [ph] moats (00:52:41) comes from, frankly, 35 million checking holders, which is a
new record for us. And so that's important. And all the feature functionality helps â€“ our retention for our preferred
customer base in the Consumer segment, which represents 70% or 80% of all deposits is 99-point-something.
And so, those customers stay with us a long time.
What I meant operational accounts on the Commercial side, all the cash is money in motion for those Commercial
customers, meaning it's part of their daily cash flow. So, whether it's Small Business customers, whether it's
Business Banking customers which are under $50 million revenue companies or even middle market, this money
is coming in and out every day and so it's very stable. It doesn't disappear from the scenes.
And if you look at our GTS revenue, you can see the Global Transaction Services revenue on the page on Global
Banking, you'll see it's grown nicely year-over-year and that's due to the stability of that deposit base and what we
see. So, it's not going to move away from the balance sheet. That's the point I said about â€“ in a rate rising cycle,
last rate rising cycle, as money supply shrank, at the end of the day, we grew deposits 5%. And so, we'll see what
happens because it's different, but we feel pretty confident.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Mike, the only other thing I'd add is, when Brian talks about operating, it's one of the reasons we highlight that
92%, 93% of our Consumer accounts are primary. And we've had 99%-plus retention rate on those accounts. So,
these are sticky deposits. That's what we're just trying to make sure that everyone understands.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One on expenses. I know you mentioned this year that you're still
anticipating relatively flat and that you'd deal with inflation pressures, et cetera, from some of the opportunities
you have to get more efficient. Can you give us a sense as to how long you think you can stay flat for? Like, is
that going to be into 2023 as well? And can you unpack some of the things you're doing to get more efficient? I
know you did a ton of efficiency pre-COVID. So, what's left? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Betsy, remember, coming into the pandemic, we had hit the point where we brought expenses down and said
now we're an operating leverage company so we'll get revenue growth faster than expense growth, but we'd start
16


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
to grow modestly. Then the pandemic had a lot of expenses coming in and out. And so, when we say flat year-
over-year, basically meaning 2023 versus 2022 in that $59 billion to $60 billion range. Our view is that â€“ our goal
is to keep that down to a modest expense growth, if any, and as we move to 2024, et cetera. But we are fighting
all those discussion you had. But the key is to have the revenue grow much faster and that's what we expect to
see as NII kicks back up and the efficiency ratios, as Mike or John referenced, ought to kick back down pretty
nicely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then the other question is just further rate backups, obviously, 10 year is already at 2.8%. It's up 50
bps from March 31. So, if it goes to, like, 3.3%, we get the same kind of hit as this past quarter. Can you just give
us a sense as to how you're dealing with that rate backup? Is there anything you would do differently? Would you
move any AFS to HTM or would you engage this new accounting rule that's been finalized in March 28 that
enables you to do last layer hedging on HTM book? I mean, does any of that matter to you? And just give us a
sense as to how much longer this rate backup is â€“ or would you change how you're dealing with it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, the piece that will matter the most will be the AFS securities. And we've talked before about the fact
that we have about $200 billion of treasuries there, and they're all swapped. They're all swapped to floating
precisely to insulate us. So, I think that's one of the reasons you see our AOCI hit is much smaller than many
others.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So then it's just a question of managing around the $50 billion or so of securities that we have there that aren't
swapped to floating. And I just note that that number has come down a little bit month after month after month. I
think it will keep coming down. We have some ability obviously to hedge that if we choose to. And so, we'll
manage our interest rate exposure as the environment develops from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. I was hoping to get a little more detail on the net interest income trajectory in the back half of the year if we
follow the forward curve. And I appreciate you don't want to give explicit guidance because maybe a month from
now, the rate environment will change, but it's also the key driver for Bank of America's earnings from here, and
obviously, a very positive story. So, just want to dig in, and maybe I'll start it with next quarter is up more than
17


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
$600 million. If you follow the forward curve, it seems like that quarter-on-quarter increase could actually
accelerate in the back half of the year. So, maybe I'll [indiscernible] (00:58:19).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, look, I think we broadly speaking agree with you. We obviously don't control rates. So, that's why we're
always reluctant to give guidance over the course of the next 270 days. But we're very levered to rates going up
from here. And we said in our remarks that we believe this second quarter we'll be up at least $650 million in NII.
And I think if you look at the forward curve, yes, we would expect to accelerate over the course of the year. And
then, we tried to give you the broad outlines around $5.4 billion versus forward $6.8 billion versus spot. It's
obviously very meaningful, but we're only prepared to look at over the course of the next 90 days because we feel
like we've got pretty good confidence around that. And I think the other thing just to bear in mind is our next
meeting is May. So, you'll see like the Fed meetings and the hikes in the forward curve really do accelerate things
in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And how do you think if we do get kind of the second 100 basis point rate increase that the market is anticipating,
what does that look like in terms of your rate sensitivity? And then, just kind of squeezing similar â€“ at some point,
do rate hikes not help net interest income or it helps but just to a lesser extent? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think just the fact that you've got $5.4 billion compared to $6.8 billion tells you a little about successive rate
hikes become less valuable. But we're probably a long way from where they stop having value. So, look, we'd
expect â€“ as Brian talked about, we're kind of at a rate floor when rates are at zero. And obviously, we'll get
significant benefit over the course of the next 100 basis points. I, like you, would anticipate less from the following
100 basis points. But again, we're going to capture a lot of value because our strategy is based around operating
accounts in Commercial and primary accounts in Consumer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. The question always is if the Fed is hiking rates because of inflation that they can't get back under control,
you got to look at the stuff that's â€“ everybody focuses on NII. But you got to look at what's going on in the
economy generally. So, that's why we have significant reserves in case it's a harder landing than people at the
Fed would like to engineer, and that's why we've run the company with such balance. But generally, a higher
sustained rate environment will help us earn a lot more money, and you saw that pick up as we picked up through
2016, 2017, 2018, and you'll see it happen again. You've already seen it happen. Just think last year first quarter
and this year first quarter, we have $1.4 billion more NII per quarter. So, that's already helped, and as loan and
deposit growths are matched with some modest rate increases.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to what Matt was asking about. Alastair, could you give us a
sense of what the deposit repricing assumption is in the plus $6.8 billion in sensitivity for the first 100 basis
points? And given your focus on primary and operating accounts, contrast that with chunkier rate hikes, how
should we expect deposit repricing to behave in the second 100 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, we normally take a look at our deposit betas over the course of history. And if you go back to the last rate hike
cycle, 2015 through 2019, on average, you can't â€“ it's obviously very different by account and line of business and
client. But on average, it was somewhere between 20% and 25% for Bank of America. We'd hope to perform a
little better in this cycle just based on the value we deliver to clients, particularly in things like digital, et cetera. But
for now, I think that's a reasonable assumption. It's difficult to project out first 100 basis points versus second 100
basis points. I would imagine for the first couple of hundred, it's going to be pretty â€“ I would hope pretty stable. But
at some point when we think deposit betas, we drift higher. We'll obviously be able to give you guidance on that in
the future based on what we're actually seeing.

getting back to 60% on the efficiency ratio. What kind of timeframe are you thinking in terms of when you can
accomplish that relative to the forward curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think that if we make progress each quarter basically [ph] but we're on to 66%, we're down (01:04:06) year-over-
year. I think if I gave you the specific quarter [indiscernible] (01:04:12) basically give you an earnings projection
for the rest of the quarter. So, Erika, I think just as you look at the businesses, you're starting to see them drop

more in line. Obviously, we always have such a huge Wealth Management business, which â€“ at 27% pre-tax
margin, which is industry-leading, moves up to 30% last quarter [ph] will impact. In fact it's a (01:04:35) bigger part
of our business than others. But you'll see relentless progress, but I can't give you the exact quarter.

Got it. And just one last question on capital. So, today, your current CET1 minimum is 9.5%. And the higher G-
SIB surcharge, when is that â€“ is that effective by January 1, 2023, so therefore your minimum goes up by 50
basis points? And Brian, what â€“ how are you thinking of buffers relative to your new minimums? I think one of
your counterparts said that he was no longer thinking of buffers upon buffers as he thinks of capital management
going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Erika, our G-SIB minimum would increase effective January 1, 2024. So, we've got seven quarters to build
towards that. Brian talked about operating and managing the company 75 to 100 basis points above our
regulatory minimum. That's obviously exactly where we are right now. And so, over the course of the next seven
quarters, we just expect to build that 50 basis points of capital.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to look at the Commercial side of loans. Fourth quarter loan growth ex
PPP was great at 10%, and this quarter a little slower. Just wanted to ask you about just that end demand
question, any supply chain â€“ any interchanges in line utilization and just what are you seeing out there on the
Commercial demand side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, our clients are definitely seeing supply chain challenges. They're working through it admirably. They're also
seeing inflation, and they're seeing labor and wage pressure. So, that, I think we all know. At the same time, the
economy is returning more towards normal and our line utilization is returning more towards normal too. That's a
part of what's driving our loans growth. So, revolver utilization in Commercial now in banking is 31.7%. Pre-
pandemic, our normal was around 35%. So, that's another 3.3%. I figure that's like $15 billion to $20 billion of
loans potential as the economy continues to heal and as clients begin to take utilization back. So, it's one of the
reasons we're still comfortable with loans growth and we see the same momentum that we have over the course
of the past 12 months.

[ph] Importantly (01:07:19), in the small business area, originations are strong and back past pre-pandemic levels
of quarterly originations. And you're seeing home equity come back up even though mortgage will fall off. I think
pre-pandemic, we did $3 billion. So, we have room on the Consumer side and on the Commercial side for further
loan growth as people sort of normalize their behaviors and activities. And you all read about the car industry. The
line uses at car companies â€“ car auto dealers was real low, and just as an example, they can't keep enough
inventory on the line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And one follow-up on the fee side. I know investment banking and trading are going to be hard to forecast,
but just any thoughts on some of the consumer-related and brokerage-related fee areas? There's been some
underlying moving parts there. Just can you talk about just the growth trajectory of some of those fee areas? And
I guess we'll kind of leave the IB trading to we'll see what happens in the markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think we're wise to do that. When it comes to the card side, I'd say flattish. We're managing to the
total client relationship there. That remains something where we're focused on total value. So, we'll see some
growth there. We'll see it in balances. We'll see it in NII mostly, and we'll see it in [indiscernible] (01:08:46)
elsewhere. On the asset management side, mostly it will be around market levels. So, we'll follow that as you will
closely. And a little bit of net new household growth and flows growth again this year. So, that's how we're
thinking about it. But I would say across all kind of flattish slightly, maybe slightly up. The only one thing to bear in
mind is just as a reminder on insufficient funds and overdraft, just remember that those that started to kick in in
February and the remainder will pass through in March. So, that's probably like a â€“ sorry, in May, and that's
probably a $750 million hit for the year, if you like, on total fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the earlier discussion on the 60% efficiency ratio. If we look at
what you achieved last cycle, your terminal efficiency trajected closer to the upper 50s once the Fed funds rate
eclipsed 200 basis points. I wanted to get a sense whether there's a credible case for delivering a better than 60%
efficiency ratio this cycle, are there structural factors supporting a higher terminal efficiency in this coming cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Steven, the dynamics could be how big the Wealth Management business sits as a percentage of the total and
just the dynamics of that business. And that's always what constrained [ph] the fee in the (01:10:28) rest of
businesses. If I remember right, peak cycle, both Global Banking went well below 50%, Consumer went well
below 50%, and then between Markets and Wealth Management. Now, Wealth Management has done a great
21

job of growing its loans and deposits. So, that will help, but that's always going to be the debate. And you should
be cheering for strong Wealth Management revenues even if it means a little less efficiency ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Well, I'll certainly be cheering for that, Brian. Maybe just for my follow-up on capital, I know we spent a lot of time
talking about AOCI volatility and the like. What I was hoping to get a better sense of, given that RWA growth has
actually been the biggest source of capital consumption over the last couple of quarters, it's up about 9% year-on-
year. Just given the pace of continued strong loan growth that's anticipated, what level of organic RWA growth
should we be underwriting as we think about the capital algorithm going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think what you're looking to is some of the RWA growth has been coming from a pretty significant loans
rebound, particularly in Commercial. And I think you're looking at some of the investments we've made in our
Global Markets business. Some of that's a little seasonal, so it pops up in Q1, and some of it is year-over-year.
So, going forward, I think our growth â€“ we'll have plenty of capital to support the growth that we expect in terms of
RWAs. We manage that pretty closely. Again, the economy is beginning to return now to something more normal
after bouncing around a bit a bunch. So, this quarter, when you think about those risk-weighted assets, 14 basis
points, Brian's talked about a third, a third, a third for share repurchase, dividend and growth. That's probably a
fair starting point.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. A couple. What are you â€“ I heard the commentary about deposit balances, Brian,
from you that they're still very high in the lower end customers. However, if we start to get a little more granular
very recently, are you starting to see any drawdown with higher spending because of inflation or any color on
that? I know quarter-over-quarter they are, but as we start to look forward to see how things are progressing, are
we seeing that yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's actually the opposite of that. They grew faster from February to March, and that's partly because of tax
returns, Vivek, [ph] that (01:13:14) they have. Basically, the broad way to think about it is beginning around May
of last year, they grew sort of 1% â€“ 1% not annualized, but 1% per month pretty consistently, 1% to 2% higher at
the lower end balances. Only in the month of November, I think, we saw a slight downdraft in the lower end
balances, and that picked back up in December. Grew January, February, March, each month, it grew this
quarter, and the March month was the strongest. So, we might â€“ we haven't seen the data for April yet, but it's
growing very strong all the way up into the people who carried pre-pandemic $10,000 to $20,000 in balances are
still growing and fairly strongly. So, we're not seeing that deteriorate at all yet.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And a completely different question for you folks. Securities growth, didn't see that this quarter even if you X out
the mark-to-market stuff. What's your plan for that? Are you planning to grow securities balances? Should we be â€“
or what are you thinking at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It all comes down to deposits. If we keep growing deposits, we got to put them to work. So, Alastair can give you
more detail. You got to remember that what drives the size of our balance sheet is our right-hand side, not our
left. And so, a $2 trillion â€“ we grew $180 billion, $190 billion of deposits last year first quarter to this year first
quarter. So, if we grow deposits, which you should be cheering for, on the core basis we do, we will then invest
those deposits in a careful way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And Vivek, if you look at this quarter, we added $8 billion of deposits. We added $14 billion of loans. That's
always going to be our first choice in terms of investment. The securities balances came down a little bit, $13
billion. And remember, if you go back over the course of the past couple of years, in the pandemic, we didn't see
the loans growth. So, in many ways, that's why we purchased some securities. It was to replace loans that were
coming off. But that's not what we're seeing now. Now, we're seeing loans growth. So, our first use will always be
for loans. And if we keep seeing the same kind of loans growth we're seeing right now, the securities may decline
over time and they stay flat. We'll see. It depends on deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And how about in terms of liquid assets? What level should we expect you would bring that down to? Because
those have come down a little bit when you look at them quarter-over-quarter, and they're also down some year-
over-year. Is there room for that to come down further? What's sort of a run rate for that assuming â€“ let's assume
deposits were flat and didn't go down, didn't grow much, grew modestly, where can that be drawn down to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, liquidity is down in the quarter. That's largely based on funding the Global Markets business with
seasonal. If you look year-over-year at our liquidity numbers, you'll see our global liquidity sources at $1.1 billion,
they're up like a scooch from Q1 of last year. HQLA surplus is up. That's largely based on things like, again, Brian
talks about our deposits at $2 trillion. We have â€“ we're probably more liquid now than we've ever been, and we've
got plenty â€“ I think as we continue to grow deposits in the future, I'd hope our liquidity just continues to stay where
it is or go higher.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I was a little disappointed about the question related to terminal efficiency. I get if you [ph] weight (01:16:59)
adjust Wealth Management, but with all the technology investments, shouldn't your incremental pre-tax margins
be greater on your new revenues? And if so, shouldn't your terminal efficiency, business mix adjusted, be better
than it was before? For example, specifically, your pre-tax margin in 2021 was 38%. Where should your pre-tax
margins be on new revenues that are generated [ph] by that (01:17:27)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The new revenues will generate more margin profit, Mike. And the efficiency ratio â€“ let's always see where we get
to, but it'll keep coming down and we are improving every â€“ all the way through until the pandemic and â€“ with
operating leverage every quarter. And I think it â€“ [ph] now (01:17:50) going back and checking it quarter by
quarter, I think it improved every quarter, leaving aside some seasonality. But we will keep driving it down.
Headcount this quarter was down another 100 people. It was down 4,000 last year. We are adding salespeople.
We're opening new branches. We're investing in the franchise. We've opened in 7, 8, 10 markets, and we have
$30 billion of new deposits in those branches to give you a sense, and there's only 140 branches. You know our
strategy, Mike. So, it's always going to come down to balancing all that. But at the end of the day, we're saying
expenses are flat this year and the NII improvement is going to flow to the bottom line. That's a pretty strong
impact to efficiency especially because it's going through the businesses, even the Wealth Management
business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, one another follow-up. I don't think there's a recession this year, but I've been wrong before, and the
stock market is telling us there might be a pretty good chance of a recession. So, Brian and Alastair, what do you
think the chance of a recession is in 2022? You have a lot more people, data, businesses, insight into the US
economy. And you need to have a percentage for that for your provision for loan losses. So, is this 50% chance,
20% chance? What do you think, Brian, kind of gut feel, and Alastair, by the numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think you're a good critic and observer of banks, Mike. But the reality is we have economists predict recessions
and all the adages about them. And the reality is they always have a prediction for recession that runs around
10%, 20% according to economists that talk to me. But let me flip to what you really said, which is we weighted
the adverse scenario factor [ph] about (01:19:33) 40% factor in our baseline reserve-setting. That produces a
formulaic reserve which is around 40% of our total reserves. And so, we have reserves on top of that that brace
us for tough times.
So, I'm not going to chatterbox with you about soft landing, hard landing and all that stuff. But the reality is they've
got to take the inflation out of the system. They know that. They're raising rates to do that. But there's tension
against how easy or hard that's going to be, obviously pandemic, war, but also this issue that the massive amount
of stimulus is still out there being spent. So, we're braced for every scenario. We model every scenario. But I don't
put a specific percentage. I just â€“ that's somebody else's job to do that. But our economists do not have a
recession predicted in terms of this year, around 3% growth. Next year, a little low at 2%, and even though there
may be some quarters that are going to show modest growth, I think they were all positive if I got it right.

Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Gerard, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Thanks. Alastair, you guys are very well-positioned as you pointed out through your balance sheet for
rising interest rates, which seemed very, very likely this year obviously. And obviously, you guys are not a PT
boat, but a battleship to turn the balance sheet into a position. And when the Fed finally succeeds let's say in
hitting inflation, knocking it down, they stop raising rates, maybe even have to cut rates to get the economy going,
when do you guys start thinking about, after the Fed succeeds at reducing inflation, that you may have to
reposition the balance sheet and not be as asset sensitive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We don't â€“ well, Gerard, just to start, we â€“ you remember, [indiscernible] (01:21:27) you know this as well as
anybody having been around this industry for a number of years let's just say. At the end of the day, the reason
why we have securities investments is because we have $2 trillion of deposits and $1 trillion dollars of loans. And
so, we got to do something with the money. And the deposits are stable, the core checking accounts, the core
operating accounts for Commercial customers, so, we put it to work to extract the value for the shareholders. And
so, it's not that we lean the balance sheet, it's as we do all the work we do in the core franchise to grow the
number of customers 10% or 15% since pre-pandemic in core Consumer checking customers, to grow the
Commercial customer base, small business base, et cetera, that results in us having a balance sheet that is
positioned to benefit from the rising rates because we have so much zero cost deposits.
And so, we don't sit there and say let's move the balance sheet. What we do is we try to protect in a cautious way
[ph] all (01:22:30) the risk. So, we hedged a couple â€“ a year or so, year-and-a-half ago, there were a lot of
questions about, oh my gosh, you're investing and rates are low. And we told people we hedged it and now you're
seeing the benefits of those hedges. That gave [ph] up (01:22:43) NII from then till now to protect the capital, and
that's what we did.
So, we're always trying to manage extracting the value of deposits and then look to the other side and see the
capital constraint question and the impact to capital to see other constraints on us. But it's really â€“ and we only
invest in treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. We don't take any more credit risk in the Treasury book for
lack of a better term, because we take enough [ph] in the company. (01:23:10)

So, I just don't â€“ we don't sit there and say let's move around, it's just how do we invest this. And we may move a
little shorter or longer in what we invest in but, frankly, we've swapped a lot of it to short just to protect ourselves,
so that we'd be able to redeploy at higher rates in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, as a follow-up, on the G-SIB buffer that you guys pointed out that will take effect, I think you
said in 2024, the 50 basis point increase, is there any strategies you can employ that could actually reduce that
buffer before we get there? Or is it really just retaining more earnings from your balance â€“ from your day-to-day
operations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think we're growing through it because it has â€“ the way that's calculated that are not sensitive to our size relative
to the economy, stock price, all these kinds of things in it that move it around a little bit. But the reality is that it
wouldn't â€“ when we look at the core customer base, we wouldn't constrain core customer growth. We can always
make efficiencies and move stuff around, and we saw â€“ believe it or not, as you can see in the other category,
have loans which [ph] in that quarter, our (01:24:17) franchise still left over frankly from 15, 17 years ago,
whenever the heck it was, that we can let run off and stuff like that or sell off and stuff.
But the reality is, is that the G-SIB buffer is growing because our Customer franchise is getting bigger and the
method of calculation does not adjust for business success, size of the economy, stock market cap increase, all
those things which, I think, you're in pretty good favor of, Gerard. So, we're going to have to retain 50 basis points
more capital. So, divide that 50 basis points by 7 quarters and think about us pulling that through. The question of
buffers to that number, you should expect us to operate close to that 10.75%, I guess because frankly the number
is getting so big that â€“ we never had an issue of the size of capital implied by that buffer to the minimum â€“
regulatory minimum.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. Recognizing that the held-to-maturity portfolio doesn't get marked to market, I
would think though on an kind of underlying core economic basis it's never fun to have a large bond portfolio
that's under water. And just looking at your year-end disclosures, it looks like the vast majority of that held-to-
maturity portfolio is agencies with a more than 10-year maturity. And I guess how do you look at the extension risk
on that portfolio? Again, recognizing it's not marked, but economically is there any way to protect yourself in kind
of a tail environment where rates go up a couple hundred basis points like they did in [ph] 1981 or (01:26:28)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. So, let me address that one. I think Brian's earlier answer got to the first part of it, which is we're not
interest rate traders. We're interest rate managers through the cycle. We got to deliver for our shareholders in low
rate environments and we have to deliver for them in high rate environments. Those mortgages protected us in a
low rate environment. And now, what protects us in a rising rate environment is precisely the asset sensitivity we
still have left in the company. And so, when you look at that $1.4 billion of growth, and now we're telling you, you
should expect NII growth from here successively in each quarter, that's what protects us. It's that balance
between capital, earnings and liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's just the cash flow of the portfolio. Even in a very low prepayment rate scenario, you got to remember, you
have people pay you principal and interest, people pass away, and then people move irrespective of mortgage
rates refinancing, and those numbers â€“ all that cash can be redeployed at the higher rate structure. So, it turns a
little faster than people think, because [ph] everybody takes it to zero as â€“ your prepayments that (01:27:38) the
cash flow off of it is fairly significant. So, we'll redeploy that and walk back up the ladder. But â€“ and also remember
economically, if we don't mark our deposits â€“ it's one of the great debates we've all had in proper accounting for
banks. But at the end of the day, the deposits are growing economically at a much faster rate than the
degradation on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. All righty. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

All right, I think that's all our questions. Thank you for joining us again this quarter. It was a strong quarter by the
team, and I want to thank the team for all the great work they've done. At the end of the day, as we told you last
quarter and a few quarters before that, the organic growth machine at Bank of America is driving hard, growing its
market share, growing its deposits, growing its loans and doing well in the market.
We will accelerate the P&L from that growth with higher rates, as we told you. We'll continue to hold expenses in
check, driving operating leverage, and that will always be a focus to get the most efficient growth we can. The
strong customer activity, which we spoke about, continues even in the first part of April here. And so, that would
end up driving â€“ is good for our company and will drive earnings. So, thank you. We look forward to talking to you
next time.
