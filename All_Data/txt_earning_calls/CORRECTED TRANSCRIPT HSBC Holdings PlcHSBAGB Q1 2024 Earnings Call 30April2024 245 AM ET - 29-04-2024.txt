MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Analyst and Investor Webinar on the 2024 First Quarter
Results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start
the webinar.
So, I will hand over to Mark Tucker, Group Chairman.

Mark E Tucker
Group Chairman, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong. I'm joining you today
from London and have alongside me Noel and Georges. I'll be making some short opening remarks before
handing over to Noel.
As you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the board of his intention to
retire from the bank after nearly five years in the role. The board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's
exceptional leadership during this time.
As Group Chief Executive, he drove both our transformation strategy, as well as creating a simpler, more focused
business through the disposal of assets in the US, France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an
improved performance, achieving record profit last year, and create a platform for future growth and development.
Noel, who you will hear from in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance
between his personal and business commitments.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
As you would expect, the board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a
robust and rigorous process to find our next Group Chief Executive. This process will look at both internal and
external candidates. I'm very pleased that Noel has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place,
ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering
commitment and dedication to HSBC which he joined 37 years ago. Noel, it's been a pleasure and privilege to
work with and alongside you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Mark. Thank you. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship, and partnership. I'm proud
of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past five years. Over that period, we have hit
some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade, and the highest dividend
since 2008.
As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for
the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a
better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of
pursuing a portfolio career.
When I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the
UK Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's
also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal
time to bring in new leadership.
The board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that
process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my
successor and to keep the momentum going in this business as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as
usual.
So, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter.
Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return
on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of
$8.8 billion, which brings the total amounts of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last
15 months to almost $28 billion. And we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for
2024.
I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've
greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated his strong and effective
leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO 15 month
ago. The board has announced a process to find a successor, and I know Noel and I will continue to remain very
focused on the job at hand, until that process has been completed.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion on the first quarter of
2023 on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on
last year's first quarter.
On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We
completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in two month. This means that since the end of
2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions
continues this quarter.
We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions, consisting of first interim dividend for
2024 of $0.10 per share, the special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds, and a new
share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within three month.
Finally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding
notable items, and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis.
So, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada,
partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable
items, profit before tax was $9 billion, with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs.
Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was
$17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII partly offset by
lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high-single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first
quarter, which underlines the value of our global network.
Banking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on a reported FX basis, mainly driven by
Argentina banking NII, as well as the non-recurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter.
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind. First, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion
from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year.
Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be
highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please therefore do
not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year. Our banking NII guidance assumes a
contribution of around $1 billion in full-year 2024 for Argentina, which is in line with full-year 2023.
Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full-year results in
February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remains stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter,
and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. However, it is still early in the year and these
things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion.
Turning to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the
normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last
year, which benefited from higher market volatility. Fees from Global Payment Solutions had another good
quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period
last year, as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer,
mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia. But growth in Wealth has been
broad based.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter.
Approximately 60% of these were non-residents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong.
Building on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in
Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.
On credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans.
These were primarily stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our
Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. While challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more
benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and
continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis
points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of high rates on the
economy.
Next, we're on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's
year-on-year cost growth was impacted by three items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-
related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this
quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly
different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next three quarters than it was in the same period last
year.
Second, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter, as we only
acquired SVB UK in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business
at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the UK, we onboarded 183 new to bank innovation
banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition.
Finally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank of England levy and the
incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline and we are reconfirming our
guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items.
On lending and deposits, there was good loan growth in the UK, the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding
Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remained subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with
Mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we
expect demand to remain subdued in the near term.
Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits
to wealth products in Hong Kong, and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits.
Next, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis point on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain
from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter.
This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points
on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends
announced today, as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results
in February, will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter.
At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 month, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of
foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion. These
losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will
have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV.

Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all
of our 2024 guidance, a mid-teens return on tangible equity excluding notable items, banking NII of at least $41
billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points, cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis, and a 50% dividend
payout ratio.
And with that, Louise, can we please go to Q&A?

Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats, Noel, on a great tenure at the bank and well
done to the RoE and the capital return.
I guess just in terms of my question, the TD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were
computing it previously, actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition
has stabilized. I think it's slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your
expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were
starting to stabilize. But is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago?
And then, secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect or is that kind of a –
are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank
term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better
classify these time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the two charts we have, it does
not affect the trend.
So, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same and we've seen the first quarter
stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be
slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full-year
2023.
As regards your buyback question, so the short answer is yes. This is indeed due to calendar effects. We just
completed a $2 billion buyback in two month, that's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we have
done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now announcing a $3 billion buyback which we intend to do over
the next three month starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes with the – it will remain at a $1 billion
run rate, we will see how it will go.

As regards any future amount of buyback or whether we are doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to
return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback. And second, we will decide on
a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook, and other parameters as and
when every quarter.

Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Hi. Morning everybody. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe two from me as well. Just doing,
George, on this point on distributions and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting
things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs.
I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. Is $7 billion of increase driven
by asset quality trends? I think you've calling out it's predominantly in Asia. What should we think about the sort of
outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan growth is muted just to get a sense of the amount of capital that
you will have in quantum terms for distributions?
And I guess the second question to Noel. Just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, Noel. The five years
preceding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess for a lot of people in your markets given
the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you've exited Canada, you announced Argentina, you're
in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets.
The return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter. You've
got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left
to do for the group to kind of progress? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question, Raul. First, on – so on RWA outlook, so of the RWA growth we
called on a quarter-on-quarter basis of $24 billion, first, about 40% of it relate to lending and other asset growth.
And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by $5 billion. There's a number of areas
of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion.
Then we've had a $5 billion market risk RWA growth. This is due to a pickup in MSS activity against a subdued
4Q and it's more in line with their activity levels the first three quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the
normalization of the market's activity.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
And then there is $7 billion which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous
exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of
geographies and a number of sectors certain names which we've decided to downgrade, on the basis that the
interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe.
You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL, and that's mainly because for many of these customers,
their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and, therefore, there is no ECL
implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it
materialize in our stage 3 loans where we increased our stage 3 loans by about $2 billion. And that's exactly the
mapping of some of this asset quality.
With regards how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid.
As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remain strong for a number of them, for at least the exposure that is
collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV and, therefore, we do not
foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a
regular basis as we always do.
Noel?

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Raul, and thank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary five years, as you say, not just for HSBC, but for the
world. And I'm really pleased and grateful, I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively
navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex, but absolutely
critical transformation plan over the past five years. And the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial
performance last year and the financial performance in Q1.
I also want to say thanks to Mark. With such volatility in an external environment, any CEO needs the support of
their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the
board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment. But the team, the
board, Mark, just collectively, we've done a good job in navigating it.
Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give a to-do list to my successor, because that is not the fair thing to do to
anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on, and I'm focused
on, for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum. You don't work as hard as we've worked for
the past five years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth,
orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy.
I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs
over the past five years. The one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The
countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in, are fundamentally now focused on the international nature
and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that.
Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable, whilst also taking
advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and that are inherent
in our customer franchise. Therefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of Wealth, our
Transaction Banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when

corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that. So, a couple good returns with sustainable
growth.
And I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we
understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's
balance sheet growth in wholesale banking in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in UK, in Europe. We're seeing
good growth elsewhere. So, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. So, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that the CASA migration in Hong Kong is slowing
down, but is not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in
Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is strategic
tradeoff between the deposit growth and CASA for you at this stage and how do you see that trend in the rest of
the year.
The second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter you could share with us some
breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge.
And if there is any run rate that we can refer to. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, [ph] Jeremy (29:50). So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong, so if you remember at
Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a
decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the two quarters and, therefore,
is broadly stable across the two quarters.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
What happened though is some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were
driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows,
you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these
outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4
and explains, if you want, the seasonality of this deposit.
Second, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue
globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this.
We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last six quarters, you've seen how our
deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers.
Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.
If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge, so, first, you would have noticed that we
increased this quarter the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 billion with the weighted average
life broadly unchanged at just shy of three years. Second, we commit at this stage to continue our structural
hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions. But we will continue the trend that we put
in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild
headwind to our banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted, as you know, and you
can do the math.
But equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing
of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the two of those effects, the structural
hedge activity for the full-year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to
the market that tailwind. We're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been
factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion banking NII and, obviously, factored into our return on tangible
equity, mid-teens guidance.
Thank you, [ph] Jeremy (33:17). We can move to the next question, please.

George, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer. You've referenced
subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether – one of
your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes
back, as a way to defend margins and revenue.
So, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan and sort of what you
think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters. I think I certainly was somewhat surprised
that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I
just wonder whether you might talk to the role that higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand.
And then, secondly, Wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely
linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now at 20% in a short space of time. But I just wonder
whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new
money flows or is there an element of sort of market vol in there that we should be a little bit careful about? Thank
you.

Thank you, Jason. So, first on banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments.
The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed
last in February. And the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix specifically in Hong
Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter.
So, we recognized these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognized quite early in the year these factors
can still change. So, this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should
expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We will reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're
just sticking with our at least $41 billion.
In terms of the Wealth performance, so recognized mid-teens percentage growth in Wealth, 34% for our private
bank. I would say couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused
strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area. And we're very
pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new
invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in
the actual revenue performance.
This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had
somewhat a subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed. So, therefore, you've seen more

pickup in activity in the Q1 2023 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 2024. So, there is an
element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing.
I just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material
change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in
mortgages. And recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the UK and Hong Kong and the
margins have been quite tight, as we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start seeing pickup in
unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than, if you want, what we've seen in
mortgages.
And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the
Middle East, the UK, et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some
stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.
Thanks, Jason.

Perlie Mong Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Thank you for taking my question. Can I just dig a little bit further into Jason's question just now on higher for
longer? So, I know you probably don't like to comment on longer-term NII. But I guess in a higher for longer rate
environment, just how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here? Because it sounds to me that
deposit migration has probably, well, stabilized a lot and I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't
already come through will come through in the next few months.
And I guess, as in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as
well, et cetera, and there's obviously a tailwind, as you mentioned, in this year already. So, how does that inform
your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? And so, I guess that's the first question.
And the second question, again on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting
your point that Hong Kong might be next in line to pick up. But I guess overall, the emerging market is probably
not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from higher US rates. So, how does that
impact, I guess, trading activities, capital flows, et cetera? Just how are you thinking about the flip side of higher
for longer? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Perlie. So, first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a
headwind with forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds
now compared to when we last spoke in February. But equally, it is early in the year and as you've seen, these
things do change and we, therefore, want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters.
We will update some – longer than what we are updating, but not at this quarter, Perlie. So, do expect us coming
in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say the one parameter just to keep in
mind as you start planning for 2025 is take Argentina out because obviously subject to the sale completing which

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
we expect to complete in the next 12 month, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from
our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025.
In terms of the broader activity level, I mean, first, if you look at the Wealth performance, just demonstrates how
Wealth remains very resilient and that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second,
when you look at our Transaction Banking activities, apart from foreign exchange which has an idiosyncrasy
related to Q1 2023 with a very high volatility, has performed across the various areas of its fee-earning activities.
And then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or
foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra-region in Asia between China and ASEAN, between
India and ASEAN, between India and the West, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean, the numbers
are staggering in some cases and these are the activities that our business is operating on.
So, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels,
there is still a very strong underlying network activity which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in
Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. Thank you, Perlie.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Perlie Mong Q

Quick follow-up on that. It's just I've also noticed that China export volume has been going up, but value has been
coming down and that is in part because of various things. FX is, well, part of it, but also government subsidies.
How does that affect, I guess, your profitability in the region in volumes going up and values going down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Perlie, if I can just give you an indication, what we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of
China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia. So, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of
the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the
first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I
would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up a quite a pace, a very
significant pace.
We're very well placed to capture that outflow and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland
China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is
performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that
is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good
intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
Okay. Thanks. I have three questions. Three small questions, actually. The first one is on non-interest income. I
look at the breakdown on non-interest income, it seems like Wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction
Banking, there is some weakness. I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason and should we
triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So, this is the first one.
The second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing the LTV ratios, I think basically they – not only the
LTV, but they relaxed the purchase requirements and the stamp duty requirements on residential properties. So, I
think that there is a significant jump in transactions. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at
least and then we are big mortgage providers in Hong Kong. So, would that have any impact on our outlook in
terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one.
And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How
should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Katherine. I'll take question one and three, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question
about the outlook for Hong Kong.
So, first, on non-NII, Wealth has performed well. Transaction Banking weakness is specifically due to foreign
exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign
exchange had a very strong and a record strong quarter one 2023 on the back of a heightened market anxiety
and volatility back then due to the banking crisis. So, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter and
it will show that drop.
But if you look at the number itself, at the revenue itself with foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So,
there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels. And we continue to expect
some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of Transaction Banking.
So, I wouldn't read more than that into it. And we remain very confident that the investment we're putting, both in
Wealth and Transaction Banking and in the technology supporting our Transaction Banking activities, do remain a
strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.
On your third question about cost, so, first, I just want to reiterate it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost
discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis. We're confident
about it and we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so, yet we showed a
7% quarter one growth on a target basis, is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are
not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the three of them out
that matter.
First, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more
evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in
Q1; hence the 2% contribution towards the 7%. But it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters, because
on a full-year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full-year 2023 performance-
related pay.

Second, there was 1% (sic) [1 percentage point] (48:51) contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter,
because last year's first quarter we only acquired SVB in the middle of March, which means we only – we
practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year and that's a base effect.
And then third, we had the one-offs or the non-rec – well, expected non-recurrence of the FDIC special
assessment additional charge this quarter, as well as the Bank of England levy. Bank of England levy is a new
charge which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And
those – between the two of them, they contributed to 1% (sic) [1 percentage point] (49:31). So, if you adjust for
those and you bake them in, we are still – and we remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or
circa 5% on a full year basis.
On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel about Hong Kong outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Hi, Katherine. I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the
developers. And I think firstly, I think the change, the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the
budget was very well received and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong
market residential sales.
It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity
positions of many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly there
was an element of catch-up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there
was low activity in the preceding months, and I think we got to see how that stabilizes.
But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the
mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes
following those changes. But a very helpful intervention. Thank you.

And then two questions, please. Firstly, on the UK NIM, you see an improvement for second consecutive quarter
another 6 basis points. So, outperforming some of the domestic peers. I can see your loans and deposit balances
looking fairly flat in that entity. And perhaps you could just comment on what you're seeing in terms of deposit

migration, mortgage refi and what's driving that NIM improvement and how sustainable even that improvement is
going forward as well.
And then the second one, just a clarification on Argentina, booked $0.5 billion in Q1, guiding to $1 billion at full
year based on last year's experience. Presumably, what you're, therefore, saying is a step-down to $0.2 billion per
quarter for the remainder of the year given that you don't expect the transaction to necessarily close until 12
months' time. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Andrew. So, the UK NIM was up 6 basis point, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies
of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments. So, if you consider broadly flat to
be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points, I would say UK NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple
of quarters, and we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly
flat some structural hedge idiosyncrasies which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range.
As regards our loans and deposits have been stable, again, the UK economy has been resilient. We're very
optimistic about the outlook for the UK specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important
customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share.
I mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back
book now, market share has moved from – or our kind of overall portfolio market share has moved from 7% to
8%. We have 25% market share in SME lending. And obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can
look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for the ring-
fenced bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. So, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our
business in the UK, our clients' activity in the UK, and the outlook for the UK.
If I move to Argentina. I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina. Then the way it works is the numbers balloon
with hyperinflation, and then they – kind of they shrink with devaluation. And it depends how they manifest
themselves month-over-month. Q4 last year has seen a hyperinflation to some level, but they've seen a massive
devaluation. If you recall in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a
disinflation of the amount that banking NII Argentina brought to Q4.
And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation. And
that will just inflate the numbers. So, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is
that it may average out to what it average out over last year, which is around $1 billion.
Now, just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the non-banking NII and you take in the cost base, et
cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. But just to put it in perspective, this is about
$0.01 earnings per share or $0.005 dividend per share. Therefore, I think as you look at the full-year 2024, that's
the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the
bank's outcomes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
I guess just to follow up on this, in a scenario whereby you didn't have any devaluation of peso, inflation was a
more moderate normal amount, what would the NII contribution be under that more kind of BAU scenario a
quarter for Argentina?

Look, again, it's a difficult one to say. But if you just do the arithmetics of our $1 billion expected for the full year,
of which already $0.5 billion has manifested in the first quarter, a smooth out outcome would be the other $0.5
billion phased out evenly over three quarters. But that's a highly volatile number. So, I wouldn't use it as a sort of
a forecast.
