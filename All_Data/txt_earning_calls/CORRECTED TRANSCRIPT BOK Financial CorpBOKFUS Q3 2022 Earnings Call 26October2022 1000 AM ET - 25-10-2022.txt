Thank you, Steve and good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's third quarter financial
results. Starting on slide 4, third quarter net income was $156 million or $2.32 per diluted share. Results reflected
another very strong quarter that demonstrates our diverse earnings mix. The third quarter ranks as the third
highest in the bank's earnings history, trailing only the second and third quarters of 2021, both of which had
negative loan loss provisions.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Pre-provision net revenue increased $42 million linked quarter as we grew core loans, experienced significant
margin expansion and benefited from our diverse fee-income base. Short-term interest rates continued to rise
during the quarter and our asset sensitive balance sheet responded accordingly. Our net interest margin
increased 48 basis points linked quarter due to loan portfolio that is heavily weighted to variable rate loans.
Fee income increased linked quarter as institutional trading took advantage of favorable market conditions and
investment banking set a quarterly record for fee income, primarily in municipals. Our asset quality credit trends
remain unsustainably good, but we did add to our credit loss reserve this quarter in recognition of the loan growth
and less certainty in the economic outlook.
Turning to slide 5, period-end core loan balances increased $522 million or 2.5% linked quarter with commercial
real estate the primary driver. Overall, unfunded loan commitments continue to grow up $1.1 billion linked quarter
with utilization rates still low. While average deposits continue to remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels,
we saw a decrease of $1.5 billion or 4% this quarter with virtually all of that in interest-bearing balances. These
declines were consistent or even better than our expectations given the rapid actions of the Federal Reserve to
move short-term rates higher.
The third quarter loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 59.8% from 55.1% last quarter. Assets under management or
administration were relatively flat linked quarter at $95.4 billion and are down 3.5% compared to last year, driven
by market impact on equities, which comprise approximately a third of the total.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Marc Maun will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $21.8 billion, up 2.5% linked
quarter, year-over-year, core loans have now grown $2 billion or 9.9%. Total C&I loans were relatively flat linked
quarter, with growth in healthcare and general business offset by declines in energy and services. Growth trends
in commercial real estate loans are traditionally lumpy, as evidenced by this quarter's strong result. Linked quarter
balances increased $368 million or 9%, with $248 million of the increase from loans secured by multifamily
residential properties and $150 million increase in loans secured by industrial facilities. Unfunded commercial real
estate commitments increased 18% linked quarter. So, year-over-year, commercial real estate balances
increased 8.7%, consistent with the rest of our lending businesses.
Healthcare balances increased $130 million or 3.5% linked quarter, primarily driven by our senior housing and
hospital acute care sectors. Healthcare unfunded commitments increased 14% linked quarter, which we expect
will drive additional balance growth. Energy balances declined $21 million this quarter, but have increased $558
million or 20%, year-over-year. Unfunded commitments increased just over 3% linked quarter, resulting in an
average utilization rate of approximately 50%, creating more capacity for continued balance sheet growth.
Services and general business loans did decline 1.2% linked quarter, but have increased $396 million or 6.6%,
compared to September 30, 2021. Unfunded commitments in the combined services and general business
categories increased 6.6% linked quarter, slightly lowering utilization rate. Utilization rates continued to run below
pre-COVID levels, so we still have significant capacity to increase the outstanding loan balances without it being
predicated on any new customer acquisition. Over the last 12 months, core loans have grown $2 billion or just
under 10%, with annualized year-to-date growth of just over 12% for 2022. Although we don't expect loan growth

to continue at this pace, we believe that the momentum we've experienced up to this point will continue as we
close out the year and roll into 2023.
Now turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio.
Non-accrual loans increased $17 million in the third quarter, primarily due to two loans, one in healthcare and
another in services. Our criticized assets continued to decline and as a percentage of tangible equity and loan
loss reserves remain at levels not seen in the last 10 years.
We took a $15 million provision for expected credit losses this quarter considering continued strong loan growth
and changes in our reasonable and supportable economic forecast, which were primarily related to a more
challenging economic outlook from the Federal Reserve's continued actions to control inflation.
Given our solid credit position today, a ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate that's substantially less
than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles. We believe we are well-positioned
should another economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead, we realized net charge-offs of only
$457,000 during third quarter.
Net charge-offs have dropped to an average of 2 basis points over the past four trailing quarters, which is far
below our historic loss range of 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to
continue to be low.
The combined allowance for credit losses was $298 million or 1.37% of outstanding loans at quarter-end. We
expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upward as we expect strong loan growth to continue as well as
continued economic uncertainty due to market conditions as the Fed pursues their goal of reining in inflation. Both
of these conditions support credit provisions going forward.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 10, total fees and commissions were $193 million for the third quarter, a $19
million linked-quarter increase. Trading fees increased $15 million linked quarter as we took advantage of
favorable market conditions and increased market volatility. Our commodity and hedging activities were flat linked
quarter at $13 million, but actually set a new quarterly record, slightly topping last quarter's record.
Our bank-wide investment banking activities also established a new record quarter, with fees increasing $2.4
million to $14 million, led by record results from our municipal investment banking segment. While lumpy in their
timing, the combination of our investment banking activities from our wealth and commercial segments provide
another solid source of diversified revenues.
Fiduciary and asset management fees were relatively flat linked quarter with a $352,000 increase. The second
quarter included seasonal tax preparation fees, creating a linked-quarter decline that was offset by reduced fee
waivers in our Cavanal Hill Funds, driven by the increase in short-term interest rates. We have now eliminated all
of our fee waivers. Our assets under management or administration were virtually flat linked quarter at $95 billion,
despite a 5% linked-quarter decline in equities. Our current mix of assets under management are 45% fixed
income, 32% equities, 14% cash and 9% alternatives.

Our relationship-centric model and product offering continues to serve our clients' needs today as we help them
manage market volatility. Deposit service charges increased slightly this quarter with growth driven primarily from
our consumer segment. Year-to-date, approximately 24% of deposit service charge fees were consumer-related
overdraft program fees. We're implementing changes to our overdraft program in the fourth quarter that will
reduce those consumer fees by approximately $2.5 million per quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue was flat linked quarter with production revenues down $1.9 million due to a $76 million
decline in production volumes combined with narrowing margins. Mortgage servicing fees increased $1.8 million
this quarter and are 26% higher than third quarter last year. During the last 12 months, we've strategically
acquired servicing of approximately $6 billion of unpaid principal balances that will add $15 million of annual
servicing revenue.
I'll now turn over the call to Steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Steven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. Turning to slide 12, third quarter net interest revenue was $316 million, a $42 million increase
from last quarter. Interest and fees on loans increased $60 million largely due to a 97 basis point increase in loan
yield. Loan yields increased as our variable rate loans re-priced in response to the recent increase in short-term
interest rates. Our balance sheet is asset sensitive with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate
loans repricing in a year or less. Interest income on securities increased $7 million linked quarter
Interest income on securities increased $7 million linked quarter as average yields increased 29 basis points,
primarily due to higher yields on the trading portfolio and higher reinvestment rates on our available for sale
portfolio. Total interest expense increased $27 million linked quarter, primarily due to a 45 basis point increase in
the average rate of interest-bearing liabilities, while those related average balances fell $1.6 billion. The average
effective rate on the interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis points this quarter.
Average earning assets decreased $534 million compared to the last quarter. Average loans increased $542
million, offset by a $989 million decline in the trading securities portfolio. Average total deposits declined $1.5
billion with materially all of that from interest-bearing balances, which was consistent with our expectations given
the upward trend long-term rates.
Net interest margin was 3.24%, a 48 basis point increase linked quarter with the increase driven by 30 basis point
increase and then it [ph] Fed new (00:13:05) spread and the 18 basis point increase in the benefit from non-
interest-bearing funding sources. With our current asset sensitive position and given expectations for further
increases in short-term rates, we expect to capture significant benefit in the fourth quarter and into 2023.
Turning to slide 13, we highlight further our asset sensitive balance sheet position and expect our performance in
a rising rate environment to be similar to that experienced during the last rate hiking cycle from 2015 to 2019.
Using our standard modeling, assuming a parallel shift up 200 basis points gradually over 12 months relative to
rates raise as of the end of the third quarter. Net interest revenue would increase 1.65% or approximately $24
million. Over the following 12 months, the total benefit increase is 4.15% or $67 million. Asset sensitivity for the
first 12 months would be reduced to an approximately neutral position in a flattening scenario where short-term
rates increase 200 basis points while long end rates increase 100 basis points. I'll provide more color in a moment
when I talk about our specific forward guidance for net interest margin.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
On slide 14, you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong. Our loan to deposit ratio increased to
59.8% this quarter from 55.1% at June 30 due to the combined impact of a $2.2 billion decrease in total deposits
and a $499 million increase in loan balances this quarter. Our sufficient on balance sheet liquidity has us well-
positioned to meet future increasing customer loan demand.
Our capital position remains strong as well, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.8% well above regulatory
threshold. With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchases, opportunistically
repurchasing 548,000 shares at an average price of $91.20 per share in the open market. We expect to be active
in repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 15, year-over-year, total expenses increased only 1.2%, with a 3.1% decline in personnel
expense and a 7.8% increase in non-personnel. Linked quarter total expenses increased $21 million, $15 million
of the linked quarter increase comes from personnel expense with $10 million of that increase related to deferred
and share-based compensation. These categories are influenced by market valuations and forecasted annual
results compared to a peer group and can move around quarter-to-quarter. Linked quarter cash-based incentives
also grew $4.9 million due to the strong sales results in our commercial and wealth segment.
Non-personnel expense increased $6 million linked quarter with professional fees and occupancy as the primary
drivers. Project related spend drives the professional fee increase, while the increase in occupancy is seasonal,
related to annual common area maintenance charges combined with increased utility cost.
Given that we have met or exceeded the guidance for key balance sheet and earnings drivers that we identified
for 2022, the forecast and assumptions will focus on the next 15 months. We are not ready to provide more formal
assumptions for 2023 as that remains a work in progress for us. But I do think the following key assumptions may
be helpful. Given our level of earnings outperformance over the last couple of quarters, we currently expect mid to
upper single-digit annualized loan growth.
Our geographic footprint remains very strong and may outperform in this cycle given the high level of business
migration from other markets and the role energy plays in our footprint. We have a strong base of core deposits
and expect demand deposits to remain relatively stable while our loan to deposit ratio migrates over time. We
follow the forward curve when modeling our rate outlook.
Currently, we're assuming a 75 basis point increase in November and December and a 25 basis point increase in
February of 2023 before the Federal Reserve pauses. We believe the margin could migrate to 3.50% or modestly
higher in the first half of 2023 before stabilizing and declining modestly due to the lag effect of deposit betas. The
September net interest margin was 3.35%. Operating revenue is very diverse and some components are market
dependent and even countercyclical but we expect total operating revenue should be in a range between the
second quarter 2022 and the third quarter 2022 reported amounts.
We expect expenses to rise over the next five quarters, but not at the level of revenue growth. This will allow the
efficiency ratio to stay below 60% which changes driven up or down by the revenue mix in each period. Our
allowance level is above the medium of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve with a less
certain economy.
Current asset quality is very strong and does not foreshadow material deterioration, but this could change as the
economic outlook becomes more clear, we expect to continue our quarterly share repurchases. I'll now turn the
call back to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.

Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steven. Third quarter results are very exciting and an excellent example of how the bank operating
model is positioned for earnings growth in this environment. We are experiencing benefit from our asset sensitive
balance sheet position, consistent quarterly loan growth across our geographic footprint and across business line
sectors as well as our diverse fee base.
We are positioned to benefit from various market conditions. Rising short-term interest rates had a negative
impact on our mortgage related business, but have significantly benefited our lending areas and related margin.
Markets have negatively impacted our assets under management. The volatility has benefited our trading and
commodities businesses.
Offering a broad selection of products to our client base is producing the top line revenue growth we set our focus
on at the beginning of the year. We expect the Federal Reserve to continue their aggressive inflation fighting
strategy with further increases to short-term interest rates which will drive further margin expansion and revenue
for the bank.
Credit quality continues to be very stable and better than pre-pandemic levels, though it is likely unsustainable.
We continue to maintain a combined allowance above the median of our peers as we institutionally believe in
strong credit reserves in less certain times. We are in a stage where the outcome of investing in strong banks
versus trading in the sector is expected to matter. Banks with thoughtful growth, a diverse business mix,
meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform. We are well-positioned, however the
economy should shift, favorable or negatively in the coming year.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey everybody, good morning.

Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hey Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting with the loan growth outlook. Can you share some of the, I guess, assumptions for what you think
utilization rates do with that? And then maybe, more broadly, what you're hearing from your customers in terms of
sentiment and desire to I guess, invest new money in this environment and whether that's more broadly across
the whole group of even more specifically on the energy side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure, Jared. Let me try to address both of those and if I missed something, just feel free to follow-up. But first of
all, as we look at utilization that really didn't factor significantly into how we were thinking about the next 15
months in terms of the loan guidance. Clearly, from my perspective, enhancement and utilization would
accelerate the loan growth. We're not seeing really material changes in utilization at all. We're still well below
where we were broadly pre-pandemic. So, there's material opportunity for moving loan growth even higher than
what we estimated if utilization rates began to move up meaningfully.
As it relates to customer and borrower sentiment, I would tell you in my career, I can't remember a different time,
in terms of what you saw and heard on the financial media versus what we're talking about with our customers,
customers are – is optimistic about their business that I've heard them talk about in many, many years. I don't
know if it's our footprint. We have a really fantastic growth footprint with Texas and Phoenix and Denver as kind of
core growth markets for us, I don't know if it's the energy piece where I think we are benefiting from a bit higher
energy – sustained higher energy prices in our core markets of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and even New
Mexico.
But borrower sentiment is very, very positive. They're clearly dealing with labor and supply chain issues. But those
are – those seem to be getting better and they're able to price and have margins in their business that help them
accommodate those higher labor costs or supply chain challenges. So, there's a real shifting sentiment I think

between what we hear from people on the ground who are running their businesses every day in our markets
versus perhaps what the financial press would have us believe is a near recession or recessionary environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then maybe shifting to the outlook on margin, what are some of the
assumptions around beta through the cycle now with – now that you've seen sort of a good quarter of real-life
example and as we look at DDA, when you say that's stable, are you saying stable as dollars or stable as a
percentage of the mix I guess and how does that factor into the beta outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jared, this is Steven. The latter part of your question there about deposits and demand deposits, I think
we're talking about as a percentage. I mean I – we may expect a little bit of deposit attrition in the fourth quarter,
just like we did in the third. DDAs have been very stable. They're staying around 41% of our entire deposit base. I
think that we can – we feel like that'll be the, what we'll play out in the fourth quarter.
Deposit betas for the third quarter were around 26%. They'll probably migrate a little higher in the fourth quarter,
maybe towards 40% or will range somewhere through the cycle at the end of the year maybe between 30% and
40%. So, you put this in context, we've got 60% to slightly below 60% loan-to-deposit ratios. We've got room here
to be opportunistic, if we want to be. Our funding levels are great, but certainly we'll need to migrate, I would say
betas a little bit higher with the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And this is Stacy. I think there's always a focus on deposit betas and understandably so in the cycle, but our loan
betas have been pretty strong given the variable nature of our loan portfolio. And so, we're really benefiting from
that as well as control deposit costs as we move forward, which is why we were able to guide related to our
margin to a much higher level than we are today. We ended September higher than we did with our – ended
September higher than we did for the quarter. And we're optimistic about the margin as we move into 2023.

Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I just wanted to start with some average earning asset balances. And if you look at the bond book and the trading
security portfolio, both of those have been have been trending down year-to-date. Do you expect those to be
close to stable or do you think those balances will continue to somewhat trend down as loans grow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, the AFS portfolio – excuse me – is down, but part of that is because we shifted some to held to maturity last
quarter. So that may be part of what you're seeing there. I really don't expect AFS securities to go down. In fact, I
think we've got a pretty decent opportunity with mortgage spreads moving into the fourth quarter and part of next
year. We may actually grow that portfolio a bit, which I think would serve two purposes. I think we'd get some
good spread on that portfolio, but we would also use that to migrate back a little bit more towards neutral as we
get towards perhaps the end of the rate hike cycle.
On the trading portfolio, Scott can talk a little bit about that. But it was down on average but the margin is really
good in that business. So, Scott can talk a little bit about the outlook for balances and the outlook for that
business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Brady this is Scott. I think that Steven summarized is it well. I think that in terms of our trading
balances, I think they've stabilized and we were able and really our team has done a great job on the desk,
particularly in the mortgage space, of maximizing the opportunities as the day-to-day volatility has widened with
our spreads. So, we've been able to produce results with lower balances there as kind of the institutional market
is waiting for the settling period, where rates have kind of set – begin to settle in.
So to the extent that we get a little bit more predictability in the outlook for rates and the Fed moves, I think what
we'll see is, we'll settle in to maybe a little bit higher balances on that as the market settles out of it. But right now
with the volatility that's there, we think that it's advantageous for us to be a little bit more opportunistic and take
advantage of that volatility on various days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Scott, you may also comment. I mean, the diversity of that trading revenue has changed a bit over the last 12
months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. So when you look at the total revenues generated from our securities portfolio, on our institutional desks,
clearly mortgage-backed securities continue to command about 20% of our total revenue mix on the trade desk

side. But we've seen our municipal activity consistently inching up to where it's now edging in at roughly 16% of
that revenue mix.
So, we've seen increase there and we've seen, for obvious reasons, the emergent of treasury volumes and
treasury activities as all investors across the size scale are taking advantage of the rates and the yields available
in the treasury market itself. So that mix has continued to evolve and change and as Stacy mentioned, we've
dominated that mix in the mortgage-backed securities side for years. But as that sector has experienced
challenge and lower volumes and flows, we've been able to pivot and take advantage of other spaces and other
sectors in the fixed income market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Then my second question was just on capital, your common equity Tier 1 is almost 12%. So, you guys
clearly have excess capital, is there a target in mind that you would like to get that common equity Tier 1 down to,
I'm just trying to figure out you're pointing us to more buybacks in the fourth quarter, but...

Could buybacks continue at a material pace for the next few years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think they could. Yeah, we don't really have a target that we're shooting for necessarily, there's a lot of factors
that go into that. But I was really happy to grow capital. This quarter, I mean, we had the earnings, of course, but
we bought back $50 million of stock, paid a $35 million dividend, and supported all of the loan growth, which was
around 10%, and still grew capital levels. So, I'm very happy with that. I'm happy with the levels, it gives us a lot of
room if we want to use some of that capital for buyback in the future, which we'll do. So, we're staged pretty well
from a capital perspective.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then finally for me, just on the reserve ratio, it was up a little bit, linked quarter, up about 4 basis
points. As the economy potentially continues to weaken here, do you expect that ratio to kind of continue to trend
higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Marc. I would say that we'll monitor what we think is going on in the economy and make our economic
forecast accordingly. And is it – if it creates more uncertainty or the downside case becomes more viable then it
might have an impact on that ratio. But loan growth was the primary driver for it and certainly some on
uncertainty, but the asset quality continues to be exceptionally good. And while it may be unsustainable in a more
difficult economy, it's at a level that we feel very comfortable given the size of the reserve that we are well-

positioned to deal with any issues that might arise from that. So, I wouldn't see – it'll depend a little bit on what we
see in the economic outlook.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hi, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I wanted to go back to fee income for a second and just talk about the – in particular the brokerage and trading
and just thinking about like, obviously a really strong quarter in 3Q. Can you just talk about like how you think a
sustainable level of that business might be and maybe how to think about the related compensation that obviously
dropped through to personnel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Certainly. Steven and Scott can discuss any specifics you have. But I think, broadly, what we were trying to do
with the guidance we provided was indicate that there's lots of categories inside of our non-interest revenue and
they move around from quarter-to-quarter. And so providing guidance on specific categories is difficult but when
you start to look at it in total, it's a little easier to guide to and so we had a strong second quarter. We had a great
third quarter on non-interest revenue and so if you look at the guidance that Steven discussed in his comments, I
think that gives you a really good band of where we think non-interest revenue could be in the coming quarters.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Appreciate that color. And then wanted to go back, you talked about the unsustainable [ph] quote level of
(00:34:10) asset quality and obviously things are really pristine. I was curious if you had any comments? I noticed
there's a [ph] straight situation (00:34:18) with the West Texas gas – natural gas situation, where it's actually
trading at a negative level with some pipeline issues they have, does that impact do you think energy in West
Texas for you at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
No. No, I mean we certainly have our customers that have – we've always had good hedge program with them
and those temporary market moves do not really impact us at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then lastly for me, I want to make sure I understood the commentary around you're expecting deposit
levels to basically be kind of stable from here? But it also sounds like you're expecting to do some securities
purchases and fund loan growth. Does the balance sheet, I'm just trying to understand the dynamic of the balance
sheet and the margin from here, you had balance sheet shrinkage in the third quarter, but it sounds like you're –
you are expecting the balance sheet to grow from here, is that a fair assessment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think that's a fair assessment. I want to go back to your deposit comment. We're not going to keep deposits
level. I mean, I do think there'll be some attrition of deposits in the fourth quarter, maybe similar to what happened
in the third. So, that part of the balance sheet will shrink. We'll make that up through some wholesale borrowing
source, which we have tremendous liquidity there.
And so I think we can continue to grow loans. I think there's an opportunity to grow, [ph] they have this (00:35:51)
portfolio a little bit. I'm not prepared to give guidance on that yet until we put our budget together, but I do think
we're migrating towards that decision where we could add some AFS mortgage-backed securities and gain some
spread there. So, I would say, yeah, the balance sheet probably does grow with continued loan growth adding to
AFS. To Scott's point, maybe there is an opportunity on the trading portfolio side to move that a little bit higher
over time. So, we'll be able to fund that very effectively with other borrowing sources other than deposit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. It certainly seems like your balance sheet is better positioned than most in this environment. So, congrats
on the quarter.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your
question.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. The asset quality looks terrific. I'm wondering if you're seeing anything within the portfolio. Any negative
migration trends in any segments that are worth noting? I mean, I think the only thing we've seen at all in the last
quarter or two is maybe charge-offs with some companies who've had supply chain issues. Just wondering what
you're seeing in your portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We really are seeing nothing systemic. We'll have – we had a one-off here, one-off there in the third quarter, but
we still reduce our overall problem loans in the third quarter, and the outlook for the fourth quarter isn't much
different in terms of that migration. So, we're going to – we'll continue to monitor it. We think our credit culture has
been highly disciplined for quite some time, so that as we go into one of a potential recession, our customers are
better situated to withstand it and not see material losses. So, we're very comfortable with it right now, but we're
certainly watching it to see if we see anything occur that's more systemic.

Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hey, Rob. We got cut off there. Matt, are you there? Matt Olney? I think he was reaching out to you for a question
and we got cut off here from the operator.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulty. We do have an additional question
coming from the line of Matt Olney with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.

Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just want to circle back on a few topics. And just to clarify the slide you have on the forecast and the
assumptions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
When you mentioned the operating revenues should be in a range between 2Q and 3Q. I think you're talking
about on the fee side, the commissions and fees, am I interpreting that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's correct, yes. Fees and commissions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I think that slide more or less says not just fourth quarter but kind of the next five quarters. So, fees
and commissions in that range in the next five quarters, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's – I mean, that's a little harder to go out that far, but certainly, we're comfortable with that. Second
quarter result, third quarter result, somewhere in that range. If you look at the composition of all of our fee
businesses, we feel like we can achieve somewhere in that neighborhood. So, that's what we're trying to say
there.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Well, I appreciate that. I get it. It's tough to forecast some of those lines and specifically, one of those lines
has been doing very strong more recently. The syndication fees have been running pretty hot the last few
quarters. Any change of strategy or any big driver of why that's been so strong over the last few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No, I don't think it's really a change of strategy. It's somewhat a maturing of the effort that we've undertaken for
the last several years. And it's a top of mind effort across all our business lines and the increased focus has given
us the opportunity to build that business and we expect to continue to do so.
It's a very strong team and I think Marc's right. It's how we've matured this business. Clearly, our energy presence
and our ability to lead larger deals and our – how we're viewed in the marketplace as an energy lender has helped
us but really, the growth there has been widespread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then changing gears on the securities portfolio on the AFS. Steven, now last quarter
you pointed towards those yields could be moving quite a bit higher and we definitely saw that in the third quarter.
It sounds like spreads remain favorable. Could we see even more improvement as we look to the towards the
fourth quarter there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We could. Yes, we're getting $150 million or so a month $50 million to $500 million of cash flow a month.
Currently, we're reinvesting some of those dollars at 5%, so you could definitely see that portfolio yield migrate
higher in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then going back to the funding side, I think what I heard you say was deposit balances were down in
the third quarter, but you think that could level out in the fourth quarter and so the incremental funding here I
guess would be more on the wholesale brokerage side, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I still believe deposits will move down into the deposit balances in the fourth quarter. I just think that will
happen, 50% of our deposits are on the commercial side. The other 50% are split pretty evenly between
consumer and wealth. And there'll be – with higher rates coming, there'll be more opportunity for some of those
clients, I'm sure to move to something off our balance sheet. So, we'll turn towards with balance sheet growth on
both loan and the security side, we'll turn towards other sources of funding, which we have an abundance of that
capacity as a company.
