Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $5.5 billion, or $11.05 per diluted common share in
2019. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $12.09 for 2019. In the fourth quarter, net income was $1.2
billion, or $2.25 per share. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $2.49 per share. We had three
adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on slide 14 of our earnings presentation.
First, we had a $48 million, or $0.08 per share, expense of launch and integration costs associated with our
Walmart partnership. This brings the full-year total expense to $211 million, and concludes the one-time expenses
related to the Walmart partnership launch. Additionally, we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired
3

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Walmart portfolio of $84 million, or $0.13 per share. The reserve build, as well as the launch and integration costs,
are recorded in our Domestic Card business.
Lastly, we had $23 million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July. These
charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of $7 million, resulting in a net impact of
$16 million, or $0.03 per share. We continue to expect the portion of the charges and insurance recoveries will
extend beyond 2019.
In addition to the adjusting items, we recognized $31 million in costs related to the redemption of our Series C and
D preferred stock on December 2. We also had an incremental $17 million of dividend expense associated with
the cost of carrying the new Series I issuance, in addition to Series C and D for most of the quarter. Collectively,
these costs decreased Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. As a reminder, preferred dividends impact EPS, but they
do not impact net income.
Moving on to quarterly performance, relative to a year ago, adjusted pre-provision earnings increased 17%, with
revenue increasing 7%, operating expenses increasing 4%, and marketing decreasing by 15%. Compared to the
prior-year quarter, provision for credit losses increased to 11%, owing to a larger allowance build and a modest
increase in charge-offs.
Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance across our businesses, which are
detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Our Card business saw an allowance build of $107 million,
essentially flat outside of the $84 million initial allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio. In our
Consumer business, there was a build of $31 million driven by continued growth in our Auto business. And lastly,
reserves in our Commercial business declined by $4 million, as charge-offs in the quarter more than offset builds
in allowance related to our energy portfolio.
December 31, 2019 marked the end of the allowance accounting that we have all known for decades. We
estimate that the 1/1/2020 adoption of CECL will increase our allowance by approximately $2.9 billion, and reduce
our CET1 ratio by 16 basis points in the first quarter. We have broken out the CECL allowance transition impacts
by reported segment on slide 4.
Turning to slide 5, net interest margin was 6.95% in the quarter and 6.83% for the full year of 2019. Relative to the
prior quarter, net interest margin was largely flat. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin increased 22 basis
points or 14 basis points, excluding the negative impact in Q3 from UK PPI. The 14 basis points of improvement
was partly driven by asset mix, including the onboarding of the Walmart portfolio in the quarter, which reduced
cash and securities, and partly by the effects of seasonal loan growth. We continue to have a relatively neutral
near-term posture to interest rate changes. Over the longer term, persistently low interest rates will be a headwind
for us and the industry.
Turning to slide 6, I will cover capital. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis this
quarter was 12.2%. In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 941 million, or 10 million Capital One
common shares. We've now completed approximately $1.4 billion of our 2019 CCAR authorization of $2.2 billion.
Recall that in October, the Fed finalized the tailoring rule, with an expected implementation in the first quarter of
2020. When we adopt the rule, we expect to opt out of AOCI for regulatory capital purposes. As a result, on
December 31, we transferred our held to maturity securities to available for sale, resulting in an AOCI increase of
approximately $890 million. Inclusive of this transfer, our December 31 AOCI position for AFS securities

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
increased CET1 in the fourth quarter by about 30n basis points. Accordingly, when we opt out of AOCI in the first
quarter, Q1 2020 CET1 will decrease by about 30 basis points, all else equal.
As we are preparing for CCAR 2020, we still believe that our long-term capital need is around 11% CET1. Let me
take a minute to talk about the factors impacting our capital need. In the 2019 CCAR, the Fed's implementation of
a new credit loss model created a headwind to our capital under stress. Conversely, the effects of the recently
finalized tailoring rule will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress. We also believe there's an
opportunity for further capital relief under the stress capital buffer framework, and we continue to keep an eye on
the Fed's implementation of CECL, which will occur in CCAR 2022. How and when the Fed implements these
changes in CCAR will be a key factor in when we will be able to manage our CET1 closer to the 11% long-term
capital need.
With that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide 9, which summarizes fourth quarter results for our Credit Card business. The
Credit Card business delivered solid results, with stable credit and strong growth in loans, purchase volume, and
revenue. Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our Domestic Card
business, which is shown on slide 10.
Domestic Card ending loan balances increased by $11.3 billion, or 10.5% year-over-year, driven by the addition
of the acquired Walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards, partially offset by our choice to exit several
small partnership portfolios in the second quarter. Branded card loans, which exclude all private label and co-
branded cards, grew 5.7% from the prior-year quarter.
Domestic Card average loans for the quarter were up 9.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. We posted
another strong quarter of purchase volume growth, as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-
over-year Domestic Card purchase volume growth was 10.7%. Net interchange revenue for the total company
grew 9.2%.
Revenue increased 7.2% from the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by the growth in average loans. Revenue margin
declined 31 basis points. More than 100% of the decline was driven by the revenue-sharing agreement on the
acquired Walmart portfolio. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior-year quarter.
Domestic Card credit remained strong and stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.32%, a 32 basis point
improvement year-over-year, driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. Because the delinquency
rate is not affected by the loss-sharing agreement, the addition of the Walmart portfolio put upward pressure on
the fourth quarter 30-plus delinquency rate. Despite this upward pressure, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved
11 basis points from the end of the prior-year quarter to 3.93%. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continued
to deliver strong results, with top-line growth and strong and stable credit.
Slide 11 summarizes fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans increased 6.5%
year-over-year. Average loans for the fourth quarter grew 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. Our Auto business
delivered strong year-over-year originations growth and a modest acceleration of loan growth, along with stable
credit results and loan yields, all in a marketplace with increasing competitive intensity. Digital innovation is a key
driver of our momentum in the auto business. Powered by our national banking strategy, ending deposits in the
Consumer Bank were up $14.5 billion, or 7.3% year-over-year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Average deposit interest rate for the quarter increased 10 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. The
rate increase was primarily a result of a product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products throughout the year.
The deposit interest rate declined 11 basis points from the sequential quarter, driven by the market interest rate
environment. Our average deposit rate paid going forward will depend on several factors, including the market
interest rate environment, our deposit mix, our funding needs, and competitive dynamics.
Consumer Banking revenue decreased 1.8% from the fourth quarter of last year. Underlying revenue growth from
higher auto loans and retail deposits was more than offset by two effects: differences in the timing of Federal
Reserve rate cuts versus our deposit pricing moves pressured revenue in the fourth quarter; and the fourth
quarter of 2018 included a small tail of revenue from the legacy home loans and investing businesses. There was
no revenue from these legacy businesses in the fourth quarter of this year.
Non-interest expense was up 2.3%. Volume-driven growth in expenses and our continuing investments to grow
and transform were partially offset by the lack of expenses from the legacy businesses.
Fourth quarter provision for credit losses increased $32 million year-over-year. Auto loan growth drove an
allowance build. The Auto charge-off rate improved 8 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter to 1.90%.
Better than expected auction values and the benign economy continue to support strong auto credit. We continue
to expect that the annual auto charge-off rate will gradually increase as the cycle plays out.
Moving to slide 12, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances were up 5.9% year-over-
year. Quarterly average loan balances were up 6.5%, compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Average
deposits increased 4.4%. Fourth quarter revenue was up 7.5% from the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in
average loan balances and strong non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 1.6% compared to the prior-
year quarter.
Provision for credit losses increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by our energy portfolio. The
Commercial Banking charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.35%, and criticized loan rates were relatively
stable compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters. The criticized performing loan rate for the fourth
quarter was 2.9%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.6%.
In our Commercial Banking business, we're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions. Unregulated
competitors continue to put pressure on pricing, loan spreads, and loan terms. Against that backdrop, we're
carefully choosing our spots and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.
Pulling way up in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, Capital One continued to post solid results as we
invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Our marketing investments continue to build momentum
across our businesses.
In Domestic Card, we generated strong year-over-year growth in purchase volume and solid growth in loans.
Credit results were strong and stable, and we successfully launched the Walmart partnership. In Consumer
Banking, our auto business delivered solid loan growth with stable credit and loan yields, and our national banking
strategy achieved strong year-over-year growth in retail deposits.
Looking ahead, marketing will, as always, depend upon our continuous assessment of opportunities in the
competitive marketplace. As we enter 2020, we continue to see resilient growth opportunities in all of our
businesses, and we'll have a full year of marketing for the new Walmart partnership. With the momentum we have

in domestic cards and national retail banking, plus the incremental Walmart marketing, we expect full year 2020
marketing expense will be moderately higher than full year 2019 marketing expense.
We remain all-in on our technology transformation, and our progress continues. We are realizing significant and
growing benefits across the company: faster to market, better products, better customer experience, better risk
management, more growth, better economics.
We're on the home stretch of our transition to the cloud, and we're on track to exit our data centers near the end
of this year. Until then, we continue to operate with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in
the cloud. Along the way, we're working hard to improve operating efficiency, even with the elevated costs of
straddling both the data center and cloud environments. In 2019, we posted a 45 basis point improvement in
annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments, and we expect to achieve another year of modest
improvement in 2020.
We continue to expect a bigger move down in annual operating efficiency ratio to 42% in 2021, net of
adjustments. We expect the larger improvement in 2021 to be aided by the full exit of the data centers and the
associated costs of straddling two environments, increased traction in our businesses enhanced by technology,
and the step-up in revenue share on the acquired Walmart portfolio, which will occur in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We continue to expect that the improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio will drive significant improvement
in annual total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well. As the many benefits from our technology transformation continue
and increase, we are well-positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term
shareholder value.
Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good evening, guys.

Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Good evening, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Rich. Maybe just to start off a question for Scott, so thank you for the moving pieces on CECL across the
different products. I guess now that day one is behind us, any color you can give us regarding the day two
impact? And maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolios? And I have one follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Well, when I think about day two, I'm going to start off by just saying, we gave segment-level
multiples. And I think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would
have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in 2020. So I think that's, in general, a good
place to start in terms of thinking about day two. I think that the multiple that we have talked about could change
gradually, if performance – the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future. But I think
those are going to be changes that happen over time. So, the transition multiples are probably a good place to
start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And, Rich, maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency, so you made nice progress in
2019 despite a handful of headwinds. I guess, what are the biggest swing factors that could impact reaching
42%? Or is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of
confidence? And then I guess, second, just given where we are in the cycle, you talked about marketing being up
moderately this year. Is there a scenario where you could see it accelerating? Or would you expect us to remain
at around these levels, plus or minus, like you articulated in your outlook? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, Ryan, let's talk about the operating efficiency ratio. We're like a year into when we set this guidance, and it
was certainly a stepping out of character for Capital One to be so specific and so many years out. And as we had
talked all along the way, there are several things that have driven our confidence. There are certain things that
are – to call them math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it. But in a
sense, getting out of the data centers is something that with the extraordinary achievement of doing it, we have a
8

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
– I think a very good handle on what the costs of what straddling those environments have been and what the
benefit of just being all-in on the cloud is. The math of the Walmart step-up, that is what it is. That's contractual.
And so I think that's a very reliable thing.
The – another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in 2021 is the
increased traction that we expect in our businesses, that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to
continue. Obviously, that has uncertainty around it, like any estimate of future business performance and growth.
But a lot of that is sort of in the works. It can be affected by changes in the marketplace, changes in the economy,
changes in choices that we make, but this is the product of a bunch of work that we have been doing. The
success of our marketing and account origination in prior years, which we've spent a lot of time talking about, and
the – some of the technology innovation that has been going on. So we feel good about that. Obviously that has
uncertainty to it.
And the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating costs of one minus the data
center exit and all the associated costs of straddling that will be eliminated. And there can always be risks to cost
estimates, but we've spent – we've worked very hard, and this is not like a new thing, we've worked hard for years
driving – gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating costs.
We do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost
savings, and collectively, when we put all that together, while as always there is uncertainty in this, here we are,
we had our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago, here we are a year into it and we feel as good as we did at
the time that we launched it. And I'm pretty struck by, in a world where so many things change, how – what we
had in mind is continuing to unfold, and that's because it's the product of a lot of work for a long period of time.
With respect to marketing, the first thing I want to say is, we don't give precise – well, in most years in many ways,
we don't even give marketing guidance at all. And we – what I would say about marketing is, and the impression I
want to leave you with is, we continue to feel very good about our marketing investments. In Card, marketing is
strengthening our heavy spender franchise, driving strong new account originations, growth in purchase volume,
net interchange revenue, loans on the bank side, the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with
cafe and brand awareness. We're seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that
are critical to building a franchise.
And also, we're a company that doesn't have 6,000 branches. We're a company that actually isn't at the top of the
league table in terms of co-brand partnerships and a lot of things. So we have to build our business the old-
fashioned way kind of one customer at a time. And our marketing machine is a key part of that.
So, what I would leave you with is we continue to feel very good about the marketing. Yeah, we got a new
addition here in terms of a full year of the Walmart marketing. And so that's going to be yet another factor that
pulls up the numbers there. There's always – we will always make our final determinations based on the
opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace, but I wanted to just give you that general window
into how we're feeling about the marketing.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the day two CECL impact, Scott. When you look at the Street consensus
provisions out there, and I'm just looking at our own, we're assuming 6%-ish loan growth, flat charge-offs, and we
have the provision of 20%. I mean, does that look commensurate to sort of what you're articulating, or is it
something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Sanjay, why don't I just step back and give you a little bit of a picture of what's going to happen with CECL. So,
just to go back and ground out how CECL is going to work, allowance movements under CECL are really driven
by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime. So you start off with loan balances at the
end of the period, you got expected future losses and recoveries on balances, and then we have qualitative
factors that are not captured in our modeling, and we add those on top.
Of those three factors, it's really the second one that changes under CECL. And because we're now going to be
holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses, and importantly, we're also going to be having the lifetime
recoveries, and that's – I'll come to that in just a minute as to why that's such an important factor. So that's the
biggest step change under CECL.
So let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how we're going to do it. We start with a 12-month loss
outlook, which we forecast. We then extend that into a lifetime forecast. And when we do that, we assume a
gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year, and then we overlay that with huge
recoveries. And future recoveries are a big offset to our CECL allowance.
Prior to CECL, we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next 12 months. With CECL, we'll be
offsetting our allowance with all estimated future recoveries. And relatively speaking, recoveries have a larger
offsetting impact under CECL than they did under the prior allowance regime, because we tend to see a longer
tail of recoveries on our charge-offs.
So, net of all of that, I think you're going to see a 1.42 multiple on our allowance in our Domestic Card business at
the point of transition, 1.49 multiple for our Auto business. And as I mentioned in my first answer, I think those are
relatively stable.
Your question about, well, how might this look in periods of stability and in periods of growth. Let me just kind of
answer that real quick. In periods of stability, you're really just going to have, take that multiple and apply it to
whatever allowance build that you are thinking about, and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy.
There's a couple things that could cause that implied CECL multiple to vary over time. And let me give you a
couple examples. So the first is that, as you know and we've talked about, CECL pulls forward the allowance
expense associated with new lending. And so all else equal, our implied CECL multiple would probably go up in
periods of higher growth.
And just to give you a bit of a sensitivity there, during our growth surge in 2014 to 2015, the implied multiple
during that period, if we had lived under CECL, would have been higher, perhaps in the 1.6% range. So just to
give you a sense, like, there's a lot of things that could move around, but if we just kind of took hindsight and
applied kind of where we see things, we could see the multiple going up into that range.
10


Capital One Financial Corp.
(COF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
On the flip side of that, in periods of high recoveries, you could actually see the multiple go down. So, in periods
immediately after a downturn, where there's higher – we've got this big portfolio of recoveries, those might
actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down. So I know that was a bit of a long answer,
but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how CECL is going to work day two.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Thank you. I have one follow-up. Just on the Walmart portfolio, I know it was known to have a lower
tender share penetration. I was wondering if that's a big growth opportunity in 2020 and a contributor in Card
growth. And then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for 2020, would this year's growth be
moderately higher? Was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate? Thank you.

Sorry, could you repeat the second question, Sanjay, your clarification question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Yes. Yeah, on the marketing expense growth, you mentioned moderately higher. I was just wondering if
2019's growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher it was like mid-single-digits growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. So I think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year. And I want to
say also, to my response to Ryan Nash's opening question, that – and one of the important drivers of 42% is the
continuing traction in the business, and marketing is a very important element of that. And in fact, so we – a way
to think about it is, we start with an opportunity, in a sense, a growing opportunity on the marketing side,
consistent with what we're seeing, overlay that with Walmart, which is a new thing. And those two things together
is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing.

Jeff Norris A
Senior Vice President-Global Finance, Capital One Financial Corp.
Rich, do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Growth opportunity in the Walmart portfolio, yeah, let me say it's certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner
with not only the world's largest retailer, actually the world's largest company, a Fortune 1 company, and to launch
a digital-first card program. So for Capital One, the opportunity divides itself into a back book, where we have
converted the old Synchrony back book and we've told you a lot about the size and the general parameters
associated with that.
And then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new
partnership. We're not going to be specifically guiding to that front book, because in many ways, this will have a
lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at Capital One. Certainly, the size of Walmart, and at
11

this point, the – relative to other partnerships, at the penetration levels of the Credit Card relationships, there is
certainly upside there. And I think Walmart certainly believes that and so do we. But we're in the very early stages
of this, but I think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here.

Great. Thanks. You referred to a 5.7% growth in the branded cards, that that, I think, was the same number that
you referenced in the third quarter, so roughly the same level as growth. Could you just talk a little bit about what
the kind of the outlook is? I mean, because that does exclude Walmart, so talk a little bit about whether that
branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating, and the impact maybe on overall growth from
Walmart? And I do have a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah, Moshe. So first of all, the front book of – since it starts at zero, the front book, by definition, will be a
growing book. I also want to point out the back book of Walmart, with the loss rate that it has, is a runoff portfolio
that's running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have. So, there are going to be two
forces going in opposite directions there, and we'll have to see how that plays out, but we're certainly very happy
to have that partnership.
The outlook, look, I think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the Card business. But I think
it's more a continuation of the story that we've been talking about before in terms of we're benefited by a number
of years of strong account origination, we have been over time increasing Credit line. As we have validated, each
successive vintage is coming in as good as it is. And in fact, if anything, the recent vintages are outperforming in a
good way by a bit some of the earlier vintage, so all that is good. That gives us the confidence to continue to drive
the originations and also the continuing confidence on the Credit line side.
Now this is all in the context of an economy that's already the longest in length in recorded history here between
recessions. But – so, with a cautious eye at the environment, the things that we've been talking about for a
number of quarters are continuing to find traction, and that – and a very important element of that is the success
of the marketing. So that's why we feel good about the growth opportunity.

Moshe A. Orenbuch Q

Got you. And just as a follow-up, a little bit of housekeeping. Non-interest income outside of interchange revenue
and service fees, kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago. Was that
primarily just the change in the absence of PPI charge, or are there other factors as well?

Moshe, can you just – which specific line item are you looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
What you guys have called kind of other income was up like kind of 55%, 60% in Q3, and 90% or so from a year
ago...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Right. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
...but I believe both of those had the PPI charges in them, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So a few things that impact that line item. So other non-interest income really is driven by oftentimes marks
on a variety of different situations. So the first is, we actually had some compensation-related assets that we've
marked, and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue, and there's an offsetting
expense that runs through and elevates [ph] FCNB (00:42:55).
So in the period with the runoff in the market, there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation. The
other thing that runs through there, we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the
contracts. Those can run through there and be a bit lumpy. I think that the level that you're seeing in Q4 is a bit
elevated to what I would expect on a run rate basis.

Just switching gears a little bit talking about NIM, I know that NIM went up nicely in the quarter, and – which I
think you had a comment in your prepared remarks around how lower rates are a little bit of a headwind. So I just
13


Capital One Financial Corp.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
want to square those two things and understand how you're thinking about the outlook for NIM, you had a nice
decline in the deposit cost, so maybe you could speak to that a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Betsy, as I mentioned last quarter, we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit
mix and deposit pricing, and we had started to see those abate a little bit last quarter. When I look at NIM this
quarter, I mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove NIM up on a linked-quarter basis. One of those
was asset mix, which was the larger of the two factors that I described. The other was – the other factor was
seasonal loan growth. So, we're seeing a bit of that traction in there. The costs – deposit pricing is embedded in
that, as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have, some of the securities, all of
that's embedded in there.
So, overall, I think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing, our betas have been relatively low since the
declining rate cycle started. That may be an opportunity. Rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive
where deposit pricing goes. So I think we'll have to see where that moves to. But at this point, I don't really see
any outsized impactors, whether positively or negative, on our net interest margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then so mix really driving the bus on that. When I think about the CECL outlook here, and I know you'd
already talked about day two quite a bit, I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the
Commercial Banking increase in your day one. I asked just because some of the other folks that we look at had
declines in Commercial. So I wanted to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
It is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates. It depends on the life, a variety of factors, so
I can't even have sort of guess when it comes to Commercial, just because the portfolios are pretty different. So I
really honestly don't have an answer to you on that one.

Richard Shane Q

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think we'd all agree that $100 loan balance on January 1 after the
holidays would have a different repayment behavior than $100 loan balance on May 1 after tax refunds are
distributed. I realized, from a CECL perspective, you're supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both. But
I'm trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that near-term repayment behavior impact
your lifetime loss reserve. And said slightly differently, is 5% growth in December the same as 5% growth in
June?

Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Rick, I would just say that seasonal growth and transactors, we look at those, we look at the likelihood of
revolving. We use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down. They don't tend to have large
lifetime allowances. And in general, I would say those aren't really a factor that's driving the multiples that we've
disclosed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. So as a follow-up to that, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that same seasonality because [ph] you
were already able (00:47:35) to factor in in the short term the repayment behaviors?

Operator: And your next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Rich, there's been a lot of talk in the banking and payments industry about B2B, and Capital One is a top
three small business card issuer. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your
thoughts are in terms of growth? And is that growing faster than your Consumer business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
So the – our small business business, we don't break that out separately. We are – as we are in the Consumer
side one of the top players in the league table, in that particular space, [ph] MX (00:48:40) is way north of the rest
of us, unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the Consumer side. But that business is a business that
a simple transfer of a consumer approach, or a lift and shift of a commercial approach, ends up being a
suboptimal thing. And the traction and success we've gotten in the small business space comes from really
working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very, very long period of time. And the – so
a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments, the reduction in
cash and checks, and so on. But what I would leave you with is, like our – some of the other investments we've
made at Capital One, this is many years kind of in the making and we're continuing to generate successful growth
there.
The one thing I would say is that on both the Consumer side and certainly the small business and the Commercial
side, the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking. I think it's really at the vortex of technology change
in all of banking. And that's partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go, but it's also
one of the places that is not regulated or is very lightly regulated. And furthermore, it is the place where many tech
15

companies who really don't want to be carrying around bank holding company, badges and things like that, focus
on how they can try to win on the frontend of banking, and leave a lot of the backend of banking to the banks.
So, I'm excited by the opportunity in – on the business side as well as the Consumer side, but I'm certainly struck
by the breathtaking rate of change. And I think for every player in the business, there is a real imperative to come
up with a strategy and work backwards from where the world is going, instead of forward from where we are.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just not looking for guidance but just thinking conceptually
long term, it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place.
And with that, is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs, the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth, may
be more efficient going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Wait, I want to make sure, John, could you explain a little bit more of your question again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
It's just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform, and it's clear to us that as a user of your
website, you can do more online. And so the question is, given that your consumers can do more online, are there
cross-selling opportunities? Are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific
product?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, from the – interestingly, from the founding notion of this company, one of the founding notions was that
marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution. And so, way back with old-
fashioned direct mail, we set out to build a business that we also didn't have a – it was brought by being very
small, we didn't have much of a cross-sell opportunity, so much of the heritage of the company for a long period of
time was focused on the origination of business.

And one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise, and there are two parts of
that. One is to really be large, but the other is to be a franchise. And if you overlay the whole digital revolution on
that, I want to redouble your point that I think the opportunity that awaits of the companies who have – who bring
three things to the table is extraordinary. One is the table stake is you really need to be large. And however
important scale was in the past, it is more important every day. And I believe it was very important in the past.
The second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability. And that's not just in terms of nice
apps and that kind of thing, but also the information-based capabilities, which increasingly are very benefited by
real-time big data and the use of machine learning. So, there's a great opportunity there. That's the second leg of
the stool, if you will. But I really, really – what we believed at the outset and what we certainly live every day is
there's a third leg of the stool. And that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise. Just having eyeballs
lying around, just having a large customer base, it's nice. But the non-linear things that happen when there is a
deep and loyal franchise is a great thing.
If you look at the essence of Capital One's strategy over all of these years, we started with nothing and have
spent years and years in the quest for scale. Secondly, we have – starting with an information-based strategy
many years ago and really – and that was again pre-Internet and all of that, but where we've come over time, the
whole tech transformation, driving toward great digital capability, and real-time machine learning, big data
capability.
And then finally, and maybe of all of them, this is the hardest one to build, is really building that loyal customer
franchise, which is all about a great customer experience, products that people can rely on, a customer
relationship that – to tell your friends about, and ultimately, a brand that stands out. And I appreciate your
question, because that has been three legs of the strategy for many, many years. And I think the growing traction
that we're having on a lot of fronts, including on the financial side, is a product of that opportunity. And I think
there's a lot more upside from here.

Brian Hogan Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks. First question is on the competition and your views on the Apple Card and if potential
pressure could come from that largest competitor, their growth has been pretty dramatic in the first year. So – and
then a follow-up on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like Chime and Varo, N26
and others, are you seeing any customer losses from those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Right. So, Brian, your questions about competition are focused really more on the sort of the tech side and the
new innovation as opposed to just the – let me start with just a comment about competition in general in the Card
business, and then let me pivot to some specific things.
17


Capital One Financial Corp.
(COF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
The Credit Card business, I think, has – I think back to the founding of Capital One, I would say that Capital One
is a very young company compared to most of our bank competitors, they've been around for over 100 years. In
Capital One's case, it's not an accident that we started with credit cards, because we had a belief way back then
that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings
power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution
were taking it. It is funny, over 25 years into this journey, I'm finding a lot of the same observations that we had
before. And I think the Credit Card as a business is kind of standing out in these times relative to the earnings
power of the business like this, as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has.
That said, that insight's not lost on our competitors, and this is a very competitive business. But because of the
scale requirements in the business, and it's a very consolidated business, and I think most of the competition
revolves around the top 10 players in the business. And I think the competition is intense, but I think it's
fundamentally rational. But the intent shows up in marketing intensity, rewards offers, pricing and various things,
but if we pull way up and I cross-calibrate to other parts of banking in which we play, this feels like the area with
the highest opportunity and the most kind of rational marketplace at the moment.
Let me pivot to the tech marketplace. Often we're asked by investors about fintechs and what about this startup
and that startup, and of course, we keep an eye on that. I think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech
companies and the sort of opportunities that they have. And so we've always had a lot of respect for that. And
frankly, our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best
practices of those companies. It certainly has our attention when Apple launches the Apple Card, I think it was a
really, really well-done marketing campaign, which is universally what we've observed from Apple for many, many
years. And we'll keep an eye on that, but I would say that that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and
impressive offerings that we are up against.
If we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there, so I'm going to switch more to the deposit and banking side
of the business, there's some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to
establish themselves in banking. We know, from having spent a lot of years doing this, and right now having a
national banking strategy, and you see us on television, it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the
established banks with great scale and local presence, and so that all of us are working very hard on that.
I have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challengers bank.
The biggest question I have, and I don't know the answer, it's just a question I have, is how much activity level
and true sustaining traction do they have; I'm not saying they don't. I think it's something that is an important place
to look. But we're inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing, and it's a reminder to all of us that
if we really lean into tech innovation, there's an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of
the biggest banks in the US have.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Okay. Thank you for fitting me in. Rich, in your commentary, you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto
space intensified to some extent. Can you just give us a little more insight on what you're referring to, and in what
ways that manifested? And then I have a one quick unrelated follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yes. So the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players, and I've often said, Eric, that
competition in auto is even more impactful in the short term than competition in Card, only because on the auto
side, you have a dealer in the middle of an auction. And when the dealer sees something from a particular lender,
like a looser credit policy or a different pricing, the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that
just doesn't happen in the one-to-one marketing that happens on the Card side.
So, it's why almost every conversation that we have about Auto, and every time we celebrate a particular growth
that we have, we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if
people are loosening their credit policies. So what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business, and
we're absolutely, every quarter, we're out there to get whatever opportunity we can have, consistent with our own
standards, and with a very, very watchful eye on the competition.
In the last – over the last few years, there was a pullback of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of.
Both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space. And what we would describe
to you is that the competition is increasing in the Auto space. It's nothing to waive red flags about, but it's
generally increasing. And the – it's a little bit unusual that at the same time we're saying competition is increasing,
that we're also saying we – our originations and even our book of business overall are actually increasing.
That is something that may be a little bit anomalous. There is also something hard for us to tease out is the
growing traction that we're getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the Auto business.
That's in terms of underwriting, real-time big data-driven underwriting, the creation of products for customers and
dealers in this space that are very sophisticated, tech-driven products that actually have real-time mass scoring of
any car anywhere across the nation, and the continued success that we've had in building deep dealer
relationships.
So particularly kind of good quarter for Capital One, but I think the impression I would leave you with, the
competitive meter is rising and we'll have to keep an eye on that. And the other very important thing that is
probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the Auto business has
been – credit performance, I'm speaking of the industry now, has been benign for a long period of time. And at the
top of the list of why that is so is what has happened, what is going on with used car prices, which have then
stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time.
This is a collateral-driven business. I also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been
high for a long period of time, one has to – we have to ask ourselves, what collateral assumptions, collateral value
assumptions are underwriters making across the industry. I'll tell you what we do, and we assume they're going
down. I can't speak for the whole industry, but I just want to put a caution that we've had good times for a long
time in that business, and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and won't forever.

Thank you for that. And my very quick follow-up, Scott, is just on the tax rate. It looked like it came in around 19-
in-this-quarter percent or so. How should – was there anything special in this period, some true-ups or
something? And how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance and Corporate Development, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me comment on more the full-year tax rate, because that's what I would point you to, the full-year tax
rate was about 19.5%. I would say that's a reasonable baseline. It's going to be plus or minus from there,
depending on the income levels' evolutions in our credit, the businesses that generate tax credits, but nothing
particularly large. We did have some discretes in the quarter which drove down the quarterly rate, but 19.5% is a
good starting point for how you should think about the future.
