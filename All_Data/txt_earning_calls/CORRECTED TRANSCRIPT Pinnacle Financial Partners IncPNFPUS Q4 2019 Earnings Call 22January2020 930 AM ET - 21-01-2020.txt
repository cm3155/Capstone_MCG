President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Cherie. Good morning. As we always do, I'll begin with this dashboard. As a reminder, it's typically
focused on revenue growth, earnings growth and asset quality because we continue to believe that they're the
three most highly correlated metrics to long-term shareholder returns.
Q4 was a good quarter for our firm. We continued to have a strong balance sheet growth. Already great asset
quality got even better. And despite a little contraction in revenue and fully diluted EPS sequentially, we still had
2.5% year-over-year growth in revenue and 2.4% growth – year-over-year growth in EPS. With all the noise and
adjustments primarily in previous period is in many cases, the non-GAAP measures might better illustrate the
relative performance of the firm.
As a reminder, the reason we begin each quarterly earnings call with data that goes back to five years is because,
as you can see, irrespective of the M&A impacts, deposit betas, outsized CRE payoffs or any of the other hot
buttons that have come and gone, our balance sheet growth and until this quarter, our growth in revenue and
EPS has been remarkably rapid and reliable.
And in 4Q 2019, we continued our share-taking balance sheet growth. However, as I mentioned on the last slide,
despite being up year-over-year, both revenue and fully diluted EPS declined on a sequential quarter basis. My
hope is that that's not a surprise to anyone. I believe we've adequately signaled to the market last quarter that it
would be the case largely as a result of two key reasons. Number one, BHG is in the process of converting a
greater volume of their originations to hold on their balance sheet as opposed to selling them through their auction
platform for immediate gain. From 30,000 feet, we agree that increase in spread business should result in a more
viable franchise so we're supportive of that.
I'm also happy to report that regardless of the increase in production for their balance sheet and the associated
reduction in gain on sale revenues that find its way to our P&L in the fourth quarter, 2019 originations for BHG
were at an all-time high, and that's where the value is created in that firm. So, we continue to expect that line item
to be up 8% to 12% or so for 2020 over 2019. Harold will cover this in greater detail in just a minute.
Of course, the second major impact came from contraction in net interest margin. Despite the contraction in NIM,
we made great headway on cost of funds in 4Q 2019 and expect further headway in first quarter of 2020 believing
we may find a floor for our margin sooner than we had anticipated. Harold will also comment further on this
momentarily.
As it relates to asset quality, virtually every quarter we report that there's only one direction for asset quality to
move. But, believe it or not, we saw still further improvement in our already strong asset quality metrics in 4Q with
meaningful reductions in non-performing assets and net charge-offs during the quarter.
I know by now everybody is familiar with the business case that we made for the BNC acquisition. As you recall,
the plan was to continue the high growth CRE platform that BNC had built and bolt-on to that a C&I platform,
which is the principal strength of our firm. The critical path to make that happen was to deliver our ongoing

recruitment competence in order to attract and retain the best C&I and private bankers in the market. Specifically,
we had said we'd higher 65 of them over a five-year period of time.
As you can see, Rick Callicutt and his team surpassed the hiring target at this point in the plan by more than two-
fold. The environment for hiring great bankers in the Carolinas and Virginia has only gotten better since we
launched our transaction there. One of the reasons that I chose to continue to highlight this in fourth quarter is it
demonstrates just how vulnerable those banks are that dominate the Carolinas and Virginia and Atlanta. And
consequently, that bears on our belief about the magnitude of the opportunity that we see in Atlanta.
Later I will discuss our target markets, the rationale for them and more specifically our focus on Atlanta, but I want
to at least highlight the magnitude of the opportunity that we see in our existing footprint by virtue of our overlap
with Truist. 91.5% of our existing offices are within 2 miles of a Truist location, so we believe we're extremely well
position to capitalize on any vulnerability encountered as a result of that merger, so our outlook remains extremely
optimistic.
That's it from 30,000 feet. Let me turn it over to Harold to review the quarter in greater detail.

Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We've updated this revenue per share slide of fourth quarter results. As
you can see we continue to experience year-over-year of double-digit revenue per share growth. The red dotted
line represents the peer group's year-over-year growth. We outpace our peers on revenue per share consistently
by a wide margin. Our relationship managers have remained focused on gathering clients and generating
incremental revenues for our firm. Obviously, BHG's performance has had a meaningful influence on these
results. As we have mentioned before, we don't apologize for that at all.
We continue to expect 8% to 12% revenue growth from BHG in 2020. Even though BHG was down in the fourth
quarter, BHG will be back in the coming quarters. As you know, BHG had afforded us opportunities to invest in
our franchise as well as provide significant tangible book value accretion. We're also excited about de novo
expansion into Atlanta and what that will do to our revenue per share growth over the next few years.
Now comparing the fourth quarter 2019 loans to the fourth quarter of 2018, our growth was nearly 12%. At this
time, we have no reason to believe that our loan growth outlook for 2020 will be any less than the high single-digit
to low double-digit growth. As you know, we booked about $2.1 billion in loan growth in 2019. We have no reason
to believe we won't exceed that in 2020. We make that statement because of the success of our hiring over the
last few years, the continued success we anticipate in hiring in our present markets and the energy that comes
through our franchise from Atlanta.
Next is an update to our loan pricing. Our loan mix averages approximately 50% to 55% LIBOR and prime, which
substantially all of the LIBOR credit being tied to 30-day LIBOR and about 40% fixed rate with CRE being the
primary contributor. In 2019, the weighted average coupons for LIBOR and prime-based credits for loan book
decreased by 57 basis points for LIBOR and 70 basis points for prime, which is somewhat of a victory given we
experienced 75 basis points of rate cuts. So the spreads in this category actually have widened in 2019, inclusive
of a rate cut.
Of significance to the spread on fixed rate credit as a proxy for fixed rate spread performance and to keep it
simple, we've traditionally used the five-year treasury as the benchmark. The five-year treasury decreased 82
basis points during the year while our average fixed rate loan book actually increased 2 basis points.

Now deposits. Average deposit balances were up $1.7 billion year-over-year. Our average deposit costs were
down 15 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 from the third quarter and stood at 1.1% for the quarter. Our
charges continue to reduce deposit rates while at the same time increasing our deposit volumes to fund loan
growth and reduce our dependency on the more expensive wholesale funding.
To that point and as we mentioned in the press release last night, we're modifying our annual incentive plan to
include a deposit component and growing the low-cost core deposits. Similar to prior years, the annual cash plan
will still be based on corporate EPS targets which yield top quartile earnings per share growth rate within our peer
group. We felt like we needed to incorporate into the plan a deposit volume and cost component to energize our
entire workforce around accumulating more low-cost core deposits. We're optimistic about this change and how
our associates will respond to accomplish this new incentive target.
More on deposit rates, our relationship managers, we believe, did a bang up job of managing our deposit costs in
this rate environment. In the negotiated rate bucket, we've achieved a 32-basis point decline since June of 2019.
Our relationship managers were very much in tune with the rate environment and prepared to have more
discussions with our client base about rate decreases. At a minimum, we should experience decreases in CD
rates for the next couple of quarters as repricing occurs.
For what it's worth, our modeling is still suggesting a rate decrease in July and another in November. Our goal is a
50% beta for our interest-bearing deposit book so we've got a ways to go to achieve our targets but we are off to
a great start. It will take us a few more quarters on CDs. Our CD book is split about 60% customer and 40%
wholesale. The wholesale CDs will roll out fairly quickly, giving us an average duration of slightly more than six
months, while the customer book will take a little longer as its duration is less than 12 months.
As the chart on the right details, through the month of December and excluding CDs, we've experienced 30 basis
points of rate declines with 75 basis points and the funds decreases are a beta of 40%. If you include CDs, our
beta is 32% but again the CD beta should increase over the next couple of quarters as CDs reprice. All things
considered, we believe overall deposit rates should be down in the first quarter.
We do expect downward momentum at rates to be offset by our usual mix change in the first quarter as non-
interest bearing deposit growth is pressured by clients reducing their balances for taxes and other payments that
normally occur in the first quarter of each year. As we enter 2020, we're anticipating that our first quarter 2020
margin may be flat to down slightly. We believe we're getting very close to an inflection point related to margin
compression.
The speculation of the credit cycle change should a recession occur has been on investors' mind for quite some
time. Right now, as far as credit risk is concerned, based on our credit metrics and what Harvey and his team tell
us, times remain pretty darn good. We've shown these charts – four of the charts provide us even more comfort
that we're not booking the very large CRE credits. Credit remains at the forefront of our mind so I hope we never
appear complacent when we talk about credit. For the fourth quarter, we experienced probably our best credit
quarter in quite some time with most of our credit related ratios seeing better results in the fourth quarter and may
be the best mark we've posted in several years. So we agree with other bankers that we're not seeing any
systemic issues that will cause us to change our perspectives about credit going into 2020.
Concerning CECL, I've read a few fourth quarter conference call transcripts on CECL impacts in day one and day
two and all that. CECL is important and we've burned a lot of time and quite frankly EPS over the last two years

getting ready for the January 1 adoption day. To be honest, I'd rather be talking about market share gains and
growth and share the excitement we have for this franchise.
That said we're in the final stages of validating the various models we will use to determine the allowance account
each quarter. Preliminarily, we believe the allowance account should be less than 70 basis points as of January 1,
2020.
So as we think about provision expense for 2020, obviously, many factors go into projecting provision including
economic forecast as well as our loan mix. In 2019, excluding charge-offs, if you were to divide up our provision
expense by average net loan growth, that provisioning expense was approximately 57 basis points for the year.
We're anticipating that we would be providing our net new loan growth in 2020 at a rate that falls between the rate
of 57 basis points in the day 1 implementation rate which, as I mentioned, is projected to be less than 70 basis
points. Again, many assumptions, tons, but if that works out, simplistically, the impacts CECL will have to our
2020 P&L should serve to reduce our EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in 2020, when we comparing the CECL
methodology through the inherent loss model.
Now, let's get back to talking about revenues. These totaled more than $263 million in 2019, up more than 31%
over 2018. BHG's contribution was up nearly $40 million or nearly 76% year-over-year. More on BHG in a second,
our other fee businesses had a strong 2019 with residential mortgage leading the way up approximately 67%
year-over-year. Mortgage had a great 2019 correlating not only with drops in long-term rates, but also with
increases in the number of mortgage originators. Again, great markets are very helpful with this line of business
so we anticipate mortgage to continue with strong growth in 2020. We have no reason to believe, we want won't
to see low-double digit fee growth in 2020.
Concerning BHG, it's safe to say that BHG had a phenomenal year and we feel really good about their prospects
going into 2020. Originations were at all-time highs and I expect stronger performance going into next year. As
anticipated, BHG began to purposefully keep more of their loans on their balance sheet thus realizing more
interest income rather than relying as heavily on gain on sale as their primary revenue source. They've secured
two separate funding sources which will allow them to warehouse their loans. Thus far, about $175 million in
loans are in these two vehicles. As a result and as anticipated, BHG's revenues were down from third quarter due
to more of their loans being held on balance sheet.
A quick review on 2019, originations increased $570 million during 2019 of which $350 million resulted in
increases on balance sheet loan balances. You can see on the chart, ranges for growth for 2020 and all of these
various areas that BHG is currently contemplating. So there's no slowing down. BHG is at peak performance and
intends to stay there.
Lastly, concerning the chart at the bottom right, the network of banks buying their credit remains very active. They
continue to increase the number of banks in their network and you can see with little changes to yields and
spreads.
Specifically as to earnings, earnings growth of BHG was tremendous in 2019 and it has a lot to do with better
analytics, better marketing, better scorecards, branching into new verticals and hiring more sales professionals.
All of this hit a new stride in the second quarter of 2019. BHG believes a fair earnings growth rate for 2020 is 8%
to 12%. As to quarterly growth of Bankers Healthcare Group, we expect first quarter to be very much as at the
high end of their growth rate when compared to last year's first quarter. We then expect quarterly results to more
or less flatten out for the rest of the year as BHG works the balance sheet strategy and their traditional gain on
sale model at the same time.

The chart on the right is at the core of many questions we get about Bankers Healthcare Group. With the shift to
more of a balance sheet model, you can see that they will not abandon gain on sale but believe they can reduce
the impact and thus diversify BHG's revenue strength which is at the heart of the strategy, diversification of the
revenue stream as well as diversification of their funding sources. They are targeting a longer term target of
interest income as a percentage of total revenues of more than 40% to 50% but suffice it to say, to get the 35%
over the next two year to three years would be a tremendous accomplishment.
So now briefly on expenses, as we know here, salary's up largely due to increased personnel and increased
award levels in the incentive plan in 2019 versus 2018. Equipment and occupancy are up year-over-year due to
increased technology cost and the branch rationalization project that we began and completed in 2019. As for our
run rate moving forward, using the fourth quarter as a base, we're anticipating expenses to increase in the mid-
single-digit range in 2020. We've got a big hiring plan this year inclusive of Atlanta which Terry will go into more
detail in a few minutes. For the last few years, our expense average assets including merger has been in the
1.9% range. We don't see that changing much at all in 2020.
And as I discussed last quarter's call, we've modified our longer term operating ranges. Our previous metrics were
in place since 2012. We believe the granularity provided by those previous measurements served its purpose so
we're now opting to go with a higher level of guidance with operating ranges for our ROAA, ROTC and tangible
equity as our current guidepost. For ROAA, we're targeting 1.45% to 1.65%. For the fourth quarter, we're
operating slightly outside of that range at 1.39% but I anticipate getting back in within the range fairly quickly with
BHG's strategy change becoming less impactful to linked quarter results and as Atlanta builds out.
ROTCE should also respond in a similar fashion. And we're also operating in the high end of the range on
tangible equity ratio. Just to remind everyone, we've operated outside our published ranges in previous years,
albeit they were the previous targets. I think it took us two plus years to get to our non-extra expense target in our
early days. Same is true today, although we're thinking it will take only a few quarters. The communication
objective here is that we will find our own way back to these ranges quickly.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry to talk about our outlook for the Atlanta market.

Okay. Thanks, Harold. As most of you know, we've generally targeted the largest, fastest-growing urban markets
in the Southeast. For some time, we've used this map to illustrate our desired geographies. There are 15 urban
markets that were originally targeted in this triangle from Memphis to DC and from Memphis to Charleston, South
Carolina. Today we're operating in 10 of the 15 and it's our expectation that we can generally produce double-digit
loan growth with no further market extension.
In other words, we expect double digit growth from the 10 blue markets in which we currently operate. That's a
pretty enviable position to build a current market presence that should yield double-digit growth. In general, we've
been operating right through the core of this triangle, but not at the fringes, so the remaining targets include
Atlanta and Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina to the south and the Hampton Roads area of Virginia;
Richmond, Virginia; and Washington, DC to the north.
In my judgment, easily the most attractive of those remaining targeted markets is Atlanta. Obviously, we've
chosen these southeastern markets because of their size and growth dynamics. They support our aspirations to

build a large high-growth base. And we've chosen them because they're familiar to us. We understand how
business is done in them.
Frankly, I love our model, but I'm not completely sure if it would be as effective in, say, New England as an
example. Beyond our familiarity with them, we've chosen these markets because of our confidence in our ability to
attract the best bankers and provide distinctive service to their clients, and that yields huge market share
takeaway specifically from those large vulnerable competitors that currently dominate all these markets.
So, in short, from a strategic standpoint, we target large high-growth urban markets that are dominated by Wells
Fargo, SunTrust, Bank of America and Regions. That's why I say in my judgment, Atlanta is easily the most
attractive market in which we can expand. It's the largest fast growing market and it's dominated by Truist, Bank
of America and Wells Fargo. All of them seem incredibly vulnerable at this time. Honestly, I view this as a once in
a generation opportunity to grow a big bank in one of the nation's most attractive markets, perhaps even more
exciting than the opportunity we saw and have seized in Nashville.
I don't really want to spend a lot of time selling the Atlanta market. I expect mostly everyone is familiar with its size
and growth dynamics. But quickly, it's the ninth largest MSA in the country by population. It's the number one
moving destination in the nation for the ninth consecutive year. Its median household income is consistently more
than 50% higher than the Southeast and as a median, more than 50% higher. And it's an extremely rich market
for businesses, which is the thrust of our firm. There are 26 Fortune 1000 companies headquartered there, 16
Fortune 500 Companies and 200 of the nation's fast growing private companies. Specifically, there are nearly
24,000 businesses with sales from $1 million to $500 million which is our target market and where we excel.
Not only are the size and growth dynamics of the Atlanta market overwhelmingly attractive, frankly the more
compelling attribute is the competitive landscape. It's a market in a dramatic state of turmoil and diminished brand
loyalty across the board. 60% of the top 20 banks in 2009 are no longer in the market. 40% of today's top 20 are
there by way of acquisition and many still exhibit the vulnerability typically associated with merger and integration.
Not only that, but I'm in possession of the Greenwich research on client satisfaction with banks in the Atlanta
market. It would suggest that even prior to the announcement of the SunTrust/BB&T merger, the client
satisfaction of those big banks that dominate the Atlanta market is even worse there than it is form in Nashville
where we've been so successful taking their share. So the opportunity is ripe.
So instead of wasting a lot of time building the case for the obvious, the attractiveness of the Atlanta market, I
really prefer to spend more time on our vision for Atlanta, what we intend to build and how we intend to do it. The
best illustration to that is what we've already actually done in Nashville, another relatively large high-growth
absolutely dominated by Bank of America, SunTrust and Regions or its predecessor, AmSouth back in 2000
when we started Pinnacle loan on a de novo basis.
Many of you will recall that the catalyst for our forming in Pinnacle was the sale of First American Corporation, a
$20 billion bank holding company headquartered in Nashville and the last large locally owned bank to be rolled up
by out-of-state headquartered banks, in that case, AmSouth. It seems to me that the parallel to Atlanta is obvious.
Bank of America, SunTrust and Regions each had 15% to 22% deposit market share in Nashville when we
started. I personally never forget Don Kennedy of Kennedy Roofing company coming in and opening our first
checking account, our first line of credit. That was it on October 27, 2000, one client. In other words, we had
nothing when we set our sights on those three dominant banks. So this chart paints a pretty vivid picture of what
we've been able to do since that time and how we've done it.

In terms of what we've done, at June 30, 2019, we continued to top FDIC deposit share chart where we've been
for a few years now. And my goal is not to gloat about our success and disparage our competitors but I need to
make sure I'm clear about the magnitude of the market share takeaway because it bears on the success we're
targeting in Atlanta due to competitive vulnerabilities we just discussed.
As you can see on the FDIC chart, today, Regions has roughly 12% of deposit market in Nashville. Regions today
represents a combination of what was once Regions, Union Planters and AmSouth which on a combined basis
had north of 30% market share in Nashville when we started in 2000. So that's an 18% market share give-up by
Regions and its predecessors since we started. And I'm not going to go through and highlight each competitor but
suffice it to say, virtually all of the big banks that dominated the market when Pinnacle started from scratch at
Nashville have given up market share from which we have successfully grown.
More importantly, look at the Greenwich Associates data on the top right of the slide. First of all, this is data
regarding businesses with annual sales from $1 million to $500 million. What's plotted here is lead bank share for
the five banks with the largest business share in Nashville and the level of satisfaction that their clients express
about.
Let me start with the lead share position. As you can see, today, we're in the first position at the top of the chart
and not by a little, by a lot. Roughly 26% of the businesses in Nashville view Pinnacle as their lead bank. Our next
closest competitor has just 10% share. That's a pretty commanding lead for having started at zero. And then
focusing on what our clients think about the differentiated level of service we provide them, roughly 90% give us
the top box rating while some of our competitors receive a percentage of top box score from their clients down in
the 50s range which is a phenomenon that suggests to me, regardless of our already dominant position, there is
still a meaningful ongoing market share takeaway opportunity in Nashville which I'll develop further in just a
minute.
Now at the bottom left of the slide we focus on how we take so much share from these large vulnerable
competitors. According to Greenwich, the attributes down the left side of the chart are the things that are most
valued by our business clients. As you can see from the key, the darker green the box, the more dominant you
are versus competitors on those items that matter most to businesses. And the brighter red the box, the more
vulnerable you are to competitors on those same items.
As you can see, we dominate the Nashville business market in terms of how easy we are to do business with,
how effectively we're able to demonstrate that we value long-term relationships, the Net Promoter Score which is
generally the measure of a client's desire and willingness to recommend us to their peers, and our overall digital
experience. I don't want to get too far from my central message here but there is one I can't resist highlighting and
that's our client's view of our digital channel offering.
As a business focused bank, I love our number one position in the Nashville market as it relates to our business
clients' overall regard for our digital channel offering versus how the business clients of Truist, Bank of America
and Wells Fargo regarding their digital channel offering.
All right, that's enough of that. Setting aside that, as you continue on down the chart, you can see the power of
our unique hiring model as our relationship managers dominate. And then finally, our treasury management
systems also dominate the Nashville market against these larger regional and national franchises.
Looking at the lower right of that chart, I won't walk you through each aspect of our execution in the market, but
you can see that businesses who aren't currently our clients hold us in extremely high regard, which speaks to the

ongoing share takeaway potential I mentioned a minute ago, and our existing clients favor us with more business
than the clients of our competitors favor them with their business. As I mentioned a couple of times now, it
appears to me that despite our dominant position, we still have meaningful market share take away opportunity in
Nashville. Our ability to seize the vulnerabilities of these large banks is still picking up speed.
As you can see, our lead bank share in Nashville grew 3% last year, 3% lead bank share just last year. This
model of hiring the best bankers in the market away from those large vulnerable competitors and then getting
them to move their book of business by enabling them to focus on what clients value most continues to be a
winning play against the banks that used to dominate Nashville and currently dominate Atlanta.
So this is our aspiration in Atlanta in the next five years. We expect to aggressively recruit and hire the best
bankers in the market from the large vulnerable regional and national competitors. More specifically, not dissimilar
to the hiring approach we took to building our C&I focus in the Carolinas and Virginia, we expect to hire at least 10
relationship managers a year or 50 over a five-year period of time.
We intend to arm them with the same treasury management, wealth management and differentiated back office
service levels that have been so effective against those banks that dominate the Atlanta market. Specifically, that
would entail hiring roughly 15 to 20 additional revenue producers over the five-year period as treasury
management consultants, wealth managers, brokers, mortgage originators, SBA loan originators and the like.
We'd expect in general to open an office a year in the business rich trade areas of Atlanta, places like East Cobb
County, Buckhead, North Fulton County just to name a few. We think we can build out a $3 billion bank in the
Atlanta market over the five-year period. We expect to invest $0.03 to $0.04 in EPS during 2020 and cross
breakeven in the third quarter of 2021, about an 18-month breakeven period.
After a lot of dialogue with a number of candidates, we selected Rob Garcia to build out our bank there. Over the
years, as I have discussed the Atlanta opportunity, I've always indicated that our goal wasn't just to build an LPO
or to just hire a small sales team, but hire management that was capable of operating across all banking
disciplines and it's capable of building a $2 billion to $3 billion bank.
Rob has demonstrated an ability to do that. He's a longstanding banker in the Atlanta market. He has been the
Atlanta market president for Synovus where he was running a roughly $5 billion bank. Prior to joining Synovus, by
way of acquisition, Rob was instrumental in starting Riverside Bank, a notable startup there that was sold to
Synovus in 2005. So Rob is uniquely qualified from our perspective. He's well known to Pinnacle's Nashville-
based Chief Credit Officer based on their previous working relationship in Atlanta. He's worked in a larger regional
bank environment which gives him fluency in all the sophisticated products provided by Pinnacle and those large
regional and national franchises.
But he has a thorough understanding of the community banking model that Pinnacle uses to differentiate itself
from those larger banks. Since joining us in late December, he's already hired three highly successful relationship
managers, one C&I lender, one private banker, and one CRE lender along with their key support personnel and
the hiring pipelines appear to be filling up pretty rapidly. So we're off to a fast start and excited about the
incremental growth opportunity that Atlanta market provides us. As I said earlier, we view this as a once in a
generation opportunity and we intend to make necessary investments to seize it.
So we're extremely excited about our prospects in 2020. Here's what we're targeting, continued double-digit loan
growth, similar double-digit growth in core deposits while we continue to beat our cost of funds down, and low-
double digit growth fee growth. Longer-term, we intend to capitalize on the economic and competitive landscape

in our target markets which is fabulous, continue hiring revenue producers throughout the footprint. And
additionally, in Atlanta, that's always been our revenue growth engine and, honestly, it's never looked better. And
finally, to continue to grow tangible book value because it's my belief that companies that can compound tangible
book value grow their share price meaningfully.
So Cherie, with that, we'll stop and take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A

Hi, Jen.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Jen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Terry, the Atlanta expansion makes a ton of sense for you guys. Do you see a potential other de novo efforts for
Pinnacle in the next few years if opportunities should arise or do you think you'll try and just focus in on Atlanta
and be – yeah, in focusing on Atlanta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's a great question. Jen, as you know, I'm hesitant to make comments about we're always going to do this
and we're never going do that or those kinds of things because opportunities change, landscapes change, all
those kinds of things. So I don't want to put myself in a position to say, oh, we just wouldn't do another de novo
expansion. But having said that and to put it into context, to be honest with you, sitting here right now, my thrust is
Atlanta. It's an unbelievable opportunity. It's what we want to work on. You know the market better than I do but it
is so large and high growing and the competitive landscape is so right. And what we do is so well suited to the
opportunity that it just becomes sort of the top of my list of what I want to work on. And so as a company that's
where we'll dedicate a lot of resource and quite honestly that's where I'll personally invest a meaningful amount of
time.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Okay. And can you talk about – Harold, you mentioned something about the growth rate for BHG in the first
quarter of 2020 and I don't think I understood it. Could you repeat that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Trying to build off the fourth quarter of 2019 but also comparing it to the first quarter of 2020 – of 2019, we
think the growth rate for the first quarter of this year will at least be 12% over the first quarter of last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And any thoughts on a tax rate for 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We don't anticipate the tax rate to change very much in 2020. It ought to be – the ETR ought to be pretty
similar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That would be for the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So that is the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We think it'll be – it won't be down much if it goes down. So we're hopefully – we're close to that inflection
point here within the first half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. And then stabilize beyond 1Q 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's our current planning assumption, Steven. We've still got a July rate cut in there. Whether or not that
happens or not, not sure. But we did a lot of, call it, initiatives last year to kind of reduce our asset sensitivity and
that has basically neutralized our balance sheet with respect to rate guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. And then on the Atlanta expansion, I'm curious how many relationship managers do you expect to
add in 2020 and how did you come up with 50 is the right overall number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I guess the thrust is sort to how fast can you hire and assimilate people? And so I think, again, in working
with Rob Garcia who is our market leader there, it felt a comfortable pace to us to hire 10 relationship managers
and I think you might think about it this way, Steven. There'd be maybe a number like 6 C&I bankers in the 10,
maybe a number like 3 private bankers in the 10 and maybe a number like 1 CRE banker in the 10. And so that
seemed like a comfortable build out pace for us and so it's just simple math from there, 10 a year, five years is 50.
That's not to say we wouldn't hire more if we have an opportunity, which we may well have but that's sort of the
core of what we're trying to do as we build the C&I platform.
I also indicated that we'll build out the other fee business professionals as well which would include treasury
management consultants, wealth managers primarily brokers, mortgage originators and SBA loan originators and
so forth. And so compared to the 50 over five years, that's probably another 15 to 20 revenue producers that
would be added to that.

Okay, that's helpful. Then just one final question. So looking at the loan growth guidance for 2020, you included
high single digit in the range. Are you just being conservative or do you see something that could cause loan
growth to slow this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah I think we're being more about – it's more about being conservative than it is any kind of statement
regarding what kind of energy we have within the franchise. We did $2.1 billion. We ought to at least do that here
going into 2020.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, Harold, in your earlier remarks, you talked about how your incentive plan relies on EPS growth versus – as
you compare it to peer EPS growth. And so as we think about what we're seeing across maybe consensus,
across mid-cap banks, either generally flat maybe even down EPS growth for most of your peers. So how do we
think about what – and I know you're not going to give us your goal. But just conceptually, is it fair to assume that
there is some level of EPS growth in 2020 over 2019 to get a full incentive compensation payout this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah I think that's a fair assertion. There's quantitative and qualitative factors going on. You're right. When you
line up our peer group, there's probably half of them that are now with estimates out there for negative earnings
growth in 2020 over 2019. So you might say well it's kind of like stepping over a rock or something to get to top

quartile. But at the end of the day, when you line it all up and you start thinking about, okay, how are you going to
propel these shares? What's going to make these shares move? What kind of catalyst might be there? And so we
use that incentive plan that help create that energy. And so you should assume that there's going to be outsized
growth and I think if line up our peers, you can probably see what kind of targets we're shooting for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So I don't know if I got to your question but that would be my response.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, you do. I think that's right. I think I would assume that there's some level of EPS growth for you to get a full
payout but just wanted to kind of confirm that. That makes sense. And then maybe a follow-up to that just thinking
about the expense build out, I mean, if we take your $0.03 to $0.04 EPS investment for Atlanta that's about, call it,
$3.5 million which is a very small piece of the overall expense growth this year if you kind of do it on a dollar
basis. So where is the rest of the expense growth coming from or is there some kind of revenue component also
in that $0.03 to $0.04 investment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
There definitely is a revenue component so Terry has not been bashful with Rob and assigning growth rates and
all that sort of stuff. So he's got himself a full time job, I'll say it like that. So there is revenue growth in that number
for Atlanta. The expense growth, we've got a significant hiring plan coming up on us and that comes with an
additional incentive cost in all that but that also gives us flexibility with some respects. So the easiest thing we can
get kind of quick returns off of with respect to our plan is to throttle back on expenses or otherwise use that
incentive plan to help us perhaps offset revenue shortfalls and we've done that in the past. So 2020 will be no
different but what we're speaking to today in our comments is a fairly significant hiring plan that we've got going
into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
And Catherine, I might just add to the Harold's comments there, Jennifer Demba asked a great question really
about, okay, so would you take on other de novo opportunities in addition to Atlanta and again that's not in our
plan. Our plan is to focus on the markets that we're in plus Atlanta. But I wouldn't want anybody to lose sight of
we're still building now a lot of revenue capability in markets like Charlotte and Raleigh and Greenville and
Charleston. And I think you probably saw in the fourth quarter, I think we added 18 revenue producers in the
fourth quarter alone last quarter – for fourth quarter of 2019. And so we're still believing that this competitive
landscape is right up our alley and we're still finding great opportunity to hire banks largely from these large banks
that we view to be so vulnerable. So anyway, I'll just give you that color on the expense though.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Stephen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I'm curious, I think you said on CECL maybe it was a $0.01 to $003 kind of drag in your 2020 expectations. So
does that imply you think credit trends should kind of continue at their current pace and I guess provisioning
would be in the $30 million to $35 million kind of range based on that math?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think that's too far off. We spent a lot of time with the credit industry traders trying to figure out what
kind of charge-off forecasts they might have for 2020 and we're just not seeing anything that would alarm us that
we're going to see increased provisioning related to the charge-offs for 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then kind of digging further into some of Catherine's questioning there, just you guys noted a
little bit below the ROA target here in the fourth quarter but obviously not for the full year. You did a great job on
the full year relative to that target but it seems like it'll be difficult really to deliver EPS growth year-over-year given
NIM headwinds, mid-single digit expense growth and maybe a dip into the high single digits on a loan growth
front. How I guess confident are you around that ability to grow EPS year-over-year apart from maybe a reduction
in incentive comp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's going to be a hard year. Obviously, the yield curve is not helpful or has improved some over the
last short term period here. But the confidence we have is, it goes back to the core, it's about what market you're
operating in and what kind of objectives you layout on these people to say, okay, what's that old saying that
without an objective, any path will get you there or something. You just got to kind of layout these goals. I think
there was a question earlier about how do we get to 50 people?

Well, a lot of that is just sitting down going eyeball to eyeball with people and saying, hey, you got to do this for us
to get to the numbers we need to get to. So we lay that out there and say, okay, you need to hire these many
people. That's the way we've operated this firm now for almost 20 years and we think that at the end of the day
our folks will deliver what we've tasked them to deliver. It's not that difficult actually as to how we operate this firm.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Stephen, I might add to Harold's comment. Just for whatever it's worth, you know this, nobody knows the future,
including me and I don't know what all the market conditions are going to do and how they might change and
what's the impact, the political discourse in the country is going to be or what the impacts by North Korea or Iran
or all those sorts of things. But if you're talking about an environment that looks very much like the environment
that we're in today, I can't imagine that it's going to be – is not going to produce earnings share growth – earnings
per share growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then just maybe last thing, I'm curious, you guys still have a pretty sizeable authorization on the
share buybacks, a little less active this quarter. When you're modeling and you're thinking about the company for
next year, how are you thinking about capital planning and the share repurchases in particular?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We're still planning on using the rest of our allocation. We're likely to use it here over the next three

Jared Shaw Q

Just looking at the BHG, with the color on first quarter, should we expect then that the rest of the year, the growth
is sort of a steady ramp from there or it will be a little lumpy?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Jared, we've had a lot of conversation with BHG over the years about lumpiness. I think the way it's kind of
planned out this year of what they're shooting for is that you'll see a ramp up from the fourth quarter into the first
quarter and then a ramp up into the second quarter and then that growth rate will basically be flattish to slightly up
for the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So it's been somewhat of a bell curve for a few years. And so I think this year, they're planning on a kind of a
ramp up in 1Q and 2Q and then kind of flattish into the last half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And do those two funding facilities, does that provide enough funding for them to meet their goals or is there an
expectation that they're going to get additional funding as we go through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. The plan for them is to fund up here fairly quickly and then what they'll do is they'll securitize – they've got a
$200 million facility. They'll securitize that facility and then in effect selling off to investors not the asset, just the
funding part. They'll borrow money to set up a security and then they'll reload the warehouse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Great. And then on the margin, with your expectation for a July cut there, if we don't see a July cut, is that
incrementally positive to margin in the second half or are you running neutral enough now where it should be
relatively neutral overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Oh, I think will be positive. I don't think it'll be a big positive, but I think it'll be positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just to follow up on those. So if I understand this BHG's funding is now
set between what they've got organically in terms of the balance sheet runway plus the securitization strategy. Is
there any missing piece that's left here or are they set?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think they're pretty much set. I think they're still working through documents all the securitization piece. But again
tens of in the second quarter to kind of do that first issuance.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
$110 million – I'm sorry. No, wait. I'm sorry. I'm talking to you wrong. Probably about $2 billion in CDs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And how much of that's wholesale?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think basically $2 billion is about wholesale. I've got $1.7 billion in brokered and about $800 million – call it, non-
core retail, about $800 million in that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That will be – that's kind of my wholesale book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And Terry, I'm not sure this is a compliment but you're obviously no stranger to acquisitions. As you looked
at the Atlanta market, clearly, you've got a horse there you've found with a leader, but how did you evaluate that
versus a possible acquisition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think I'd say there's two or three things that are important to me. Goal one is to get to the market. We've
sort of had it as a target for a long time but the vulnerability really accelerated in Atlanta over the last 12 months in
the competitive landscape. And so it just got important to me to get there, not insincere when I say it might be as
big an opportunity as the one we seized in Nashville. So then underneath that, obviously, we have discussions
about M&A and about de novo model. I think I've said all along I'd be prepared to go either way and I still say that
that would reflect my mindset, I would've been willing to go either way. It gets back to can you hire somebody,
how big a book can they build and then if you do an M&A transaction, what are all the implications of that, what's
the price going to be, what's the accretion going to be, all those kinds of things. And so at least, at this moment,
the de novo start felt best to us.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Tyler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Just two more for me. I just wanted to follow up on the inclusion of the core deposit growth within the
incentive plan. How much weighting does that carry in the plan this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
It'll be a similar weighting to the revenue share that we've had in prior years. So it'll be around 20% or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify, as you guys pencil out the 2020 year with the guidance and outlook you've
laid out, you do think that you can get back within your ROAA and ROTCE target range over the next couple of
quarters with that July and November cut assumption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. I think the ROAA target will be a little – it will be a little easier than ROTCE target. But we still
think that our modeling shows that we'll get back within.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Should there be any much balance sheet, the difference between kind of loan growth and overall balance
sheet growth, would that differ much or total balance sheet growth just still be kind of high single digits, low double
digits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think balance sheet growth and loan growth will run kind of similar growth rates.

Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning.

Hey, Brian.

Hey, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, Harold. Just one thing back to the margin, I mean, if you get the two cuts, if you don't get the two cuts that
you expect I guess is there are upside to the margin. Is that how we should think about it given kind of what
you've – the plans you've outlined.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
It sounds like stable with the cuts and then maybe some upside if you don't get the cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it is that way. I think there's going to be a slight positive to a no cut environment or flat fed funds rate for the
year. We did a lot of work last year that to, like I said, remove asset sensitivity. So I think we're much more neutral
with respect to interest rate risk management issue.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Okay. Perfect. Then I think you said on the expense outlook, it's a mid-single-digit growth rate. Is that off of 2019
and does that include the Atlanta build out, the cost for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. It's off of the fourth quarter run rate.

And it's got a component in their port land.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. All right. And then last thing on the clarification on BHG, I think the revenues in – I thought your comment
was that the revenues in BHG are up 8% to 12% in 2020 versus 2019. In 2019, was like a $90 million numbers. Is
that the right math, how we're thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

the improvement in the cost of deposits, continued balance sheet growth and continued hiring. And our outlook for
