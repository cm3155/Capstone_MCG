M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Luthania. And thank all of you for joining us this morning for the second quarter earnings call. As I'm
confident you've already seen 2Q was a fabulous quarter for us in terms of financial performance. Over the years
when the stock appears undervalued, analysts will sometimes ask me, Terry, what do you think the market is
missing. So, as I walk through my opening comments and as Harold reviews our second quarter performance in
greater detail, we hope to draw your attention to these five things, where I believe there may be a disconnect
between the financial performance, the value that's being created and the valuation.
Number one, I believe management's drive and incentive to alter outcomes is significantly underestimated. As an
example, a standard 10-K disposal asset sensitivity model projections assumes management won't alter its main
current sensitivity. And I get it, because we've all seen some management teams just wait for an upgrade cycle
for years consistently underperforming. Instead, as an example, we got our clients to agree to $7.7 million in
floors alter an outcome that would have been predicted going into the last Fed easing cycle. I expected pretty
much the same in this Fed tightening cycle. So, we'll try to help investors understand the meaningful incentives
this management team has to alter outcomes when situations change, which partially accounts for the success
we've enjoyed over the last 3 years, 5 years 10 years, and honestly, since our inception 22 years ago.
Number two, I think many underestimate the power of our culture. I think most everybody would recognize that we
put a lot of emphasis on culture and likely say that's nice and may think it's hard to tell. But many don't understand
that we do that because we believe it really has enabled Pinnacle outperform peers cycle in and cycle out. People
less familiar with the firm underestimate the fact that our outsized shareholder returns over the last 22 years or
you're talking about the last 3 years, the last 5 years, the last 10 years or the last 20 have largely occurred as a
result of that culture. And I'm personally betting it can be relied upon to produce outsized shareholder value over
the next 3 years, 5 years and so forth.
Number three, I believe many don't understand what we view is the overwhelming, almost unstoppable balance
sheet and P&L momentum. It's been built by our relentless effort to attract and retain the best revenue producers,
both in our existing markets as well as the other Southeastern attractive markets to which we've recently
extended. Of course, you can easily see it looking at the history, but I'm hopeful we can illustrate this power and
reliability going forward. We believe there is incredible balance sheet and P&L momentum already built in as the
revenue producers we've hired over the last few years continue to consolidate their books of business to
Pinnacle.
Number four, similarly, I believe many don't thoroughly understand the power that our hiring model has on asset
quality. Hiring bankers, who've been handling the book of business for decades, is the single best mechanism
which I'm familiar to ensure better client selection, and better client selection is how high loan quality is produced.
And finally, I believe many underestimate the value of BHG, its unique funding model and what that means to the
shareholders of Pinnacle, not only in terms of the very significant hidden equity on our balance sheet as a result
of the difference between what we carry in that and what its worth, but the power and flexibility provided by our
growing earnings stream, particularly as many of the fintech asset generators are faltering. Access to funding is

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
quickly becoming key to success to these asset generators and BHG demonstrated over its long history and as
recently as in the second quarter that it has the ability to access funding in ways that many of its competitors
cannot.
Now, as we always do, we'll begin with the shareholder value dashboard, GAAP measures first, followed by the
non-GAAP measures. As to second quarter results specifically, I don't know what hasn't been said regarding
asset quality, net charge-offs, classified assets, nonperformers are all at either historic or near historic lows. I'm
sure some will say, well, okay, that's backward looking, we're more concerned about what's in front of us, which I
get, but I don't want anyone to miss this. It'd be hard to produce those metrics even in good times when we're not
proactive managers of our loan book.
And at the risk of [indiscernible] (00:07:00), let me also add that over the last 90 days or so, we've been actively
cycling underwriting in an effort to better position the bank for a more difficult credit environment, which honestly I
believe is likely. But I think most are beginning to believe that while we're likely in for a more difficult credit
environment, bank loan portfolios are likely to hold up significantly better than they did in the 2008/2009. We'll talk
more about some of the marginal tightening we're doing a little bit later, but it's suffice to say, our asset quality is
in the best shape it's probably ever been, which is exactly where you want to be if you believe you're headed into
a more difficult credit environment.
As I remind you each quarter, I primarily focus on this dashboard because it's our belief that these specific metrics
provide the best insight into how successful we'll be in producing long-term shareholder value that over a long
period of time they've been some of the most highly correlated to shareholder returns. There are a lot of things
that are interesting to measure in the banking business, and my suspicion is we're measuring virtually every
single one of them. But certainly, we measure things like asset sensitivity and jobs and rent environment, deposit
cost betas, noninterest expense growth rates, et cetera.
But you have to be careful. The goal is not asset sensitivity. It's net interest income growth. The goal is not low
deposit cost betas. It's net interest income growth. The goal is not containing noninterest expenses. It's growing
EPS. In fact, I don't believe any of those things I just mentioned, asset sensitivity, deposit cost betas and
noninterest expense growth rates would be highly correlated to long-term shareholder value creation at all. In fact,
I'm not even sure how predictive they are on more short-term results, which I'll talk more on in a minute.
At any rate, we remain confident as we have been since the early days of this firm that revenue growth, EPS
growth, tangible book value accretion and ROTCE along with asset quality are the items most highly correlated to
share price performance over time. That's why we're relentlessly focused on these items, and that's why I believe
we've had one of the highest total shareholder returns in all of the publicly traded banks in the country since our
inception in 2000.
Here we track asset sensitivity and deposit cost betas, but we really focus more on growing net interest income
because that's how you grow revenue and EPS. My guess is that there're likely banks with assumption-based
models calculating greater asset sensitivity than we disclose and banks with lower deposit cost betas and those
that are forecast for us, that was freeing really well, but unlikely to come close to our net interest income growth
rate and therefore to our revenue and EPS growth rates through the cycle.
Certainly, no one knows the future, including me, but my experience as a meaningful investor in this firm for more
than two decades is the targeting top quartile performance on specific metrics like EPS and revenue growth. And
not only targeting top quartile performance that tie in our incentives to them year in, year out as our shareholders
have been rewarded.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
So, with that as a backdrop, looking at the revenue growth in Q2 and over time. Obviously, the annualized growth
in 2Q is pretty special, that don't get the CAGR since January of 2018 and the relatively stable quarterly growth. In
addition to rapidly growing loan volumes and rapidly expanding margins, 2Q was also aided by BHG's
outperformance in the quarter.
BHG falls over the second half 2022 earnings forward into the second quarter, and Harold will talk more about
that in a minute. But it's not the least that BHG is really showcasing one of their model, particularly their ability to
fund loans at an attractive rate is different, better, and more valuable with classic fintech asset generators, many
of whom don't produce any earnings at all and many of them are struggling to solve a funding rule.
While funding for these kinds of assets during the period of Fed tightening and potential recession, that likely be
more difficult or expensive for all asset generators, but I'd expect BHG's funding to be much more resilient and
mostly required for fintechs and truly differentiates the power of their model over those, both because of their
proprietary online and auction platforms been utilized by over 25% of the banks in this country, and they're
standing with rating agencies for asset securitizations.
Harold will review this more in a minute, but in addition to running $505 million including the auction platform in
2Q, BHG completed a $300 million securitization in the second quarter, even if it's rumored that a number of the
classic fintech didn't get their securitizations done. Again, BHG is in no way your classic fintech, in addition to the
substantial earnings, I believe it offers much greater sustainability than most peers.
And it's really the same story for EPS, generally up into the right. Of course, you get a big dip in 1Q 2020 as we
built reserves during COVID and then a slight dip as we've had to outrun the benefits of the PPP as those loan
burned off. The truth is, most point in 2022, we had difficult time growing earnings at all due to the impact of losing
PPP income as the consensus for us in early January, before we released 4Q 2021 result, was the weaker
experienced a decrease in EPS of 5% and 8% in 2022.
While we don't disclose our incentive targets, including for EPS, you can be sure that our internal targets in order
to earn incentives at target did not contemplate a reduction in EPS in 2022. During the second quarter, you can
see our widening margin along with our unused ability to attract clients and grow loans is really the key to our
revenues and earnings growth. And that's why we also included the balance sheet growth metrics because at
Pinnacle, they generally provide the best insight into the sustainability of the net interest revenue growth.
We've had loan growth, 32% annualized. I recognized that some of you may be like me and you describe to all
[indiscernible] (00:13:09). And it's usual that you might say, wow, that loan growth is surprising and particularly if
you believe we're heading into a recession. And so later in the call, Harold will dissect the loan growth in a way
that I believe illustrates one is not leading but just the high-quality outcome derived from our strategic advantage,
our relentless focus on the execution of a highly successful organic growth model, and our endless building effort
since the great recession, which I'll touch on more in a minute.
Deposit growth slowed in the second quarter, which is not unusual given the tax payment outflows. We believe
our IRS statements were measurably elevated this year. But we're encouraged that the growth rebounded in the
second half of the quarter, particularly in the DDA category. Harold will provide more on that as well.
Before I move on to why it works that way, I will take just a second to illustrate what I'm talking about in terms of
why I think we all should focus on net interest income growth as opposed to central proxies like deposit betas.
During the last upgrade cycle, they had made their first move in 4Q 2015. So that's the start point for this slide.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
The two dash lines represent the cumulative basis through the Fed tighten cycle, the blue is Pinnacle and the
green is peers. As you can see, the people seemed to bet on cumulative betas with an overlooked PNFP, for
sure, given the substantially higher cumulative beta through the cycle. Investors that were able to look through the
net interest income growth were highly rewarded with very rapid net interest income growth per share through the
cycle, roughly 61% higher than peers, a substantial outperformance.
And that's because there are other critical variables like loan rate betas, balance sheet growth volume growth
rates, and other management taxes and also asset sensitivity that has the potential to substantially outrun the
potential impact of deposit cost betas.
Now, setting aside the need to focus on a lot more than central deposit cost betas, I will say this for all the deposit
cost betas that we'll see, it would shock me if Pinnacle's betas were anywhere near as high this cycle as they
were in the last cycle for four key reasons.
Number one, we begin the cycle with a substantially lower dependence on non-core funding, which reduces the
immediate bidding pressure on core funding.
Number two, competitors are also watching liquidity, which should dampen the competitive thirst for deposits. To
that point, I heard a number of banks bragging on earnings calls here in the second quarter about their betas
being lower than anticipated.
Number three, last cycle, Pinnacle integrated three banks during the cycle, which requires a heightened focus on
holding their clients for which we just paid a premium, and therefore, we had an increased urgency to raise rates.
And number four, the magnitude and speed of Fed move this cycle affords banks like our more opportunity to
compress the beta or retain more of an increase. So it's my expectation, given those four factors, that we will be
able to expand margins and grow loans in support of our net interest income growth.
So, now I want to move to why I think it works that way, while the momentum continues to build so much more
rapidly than peers and competitors. And Jim Collins about this concept [indiscernible] (00:16:29) how good
companies become great companies and referred to it as the Flywheel Concept. As a result, and you'll hear in just
one minute, he describes it this way and I quote, "Picture a huge, heavy flywheel, a massive metal disk mounted
horizontally on an axle, about 30 feet in diameter, 2 feet thick, and weighing about 5,000 pounds. Now imagine
that your task is to get the flywheel rotating on the axle as fast and long as possible. Pushing with great effort, you
get the flywheel to inch forward, moving almost imperceptibly at first. You keep pushing and, after two or three
hours of persistent effort, you get the flywheel to complete one entire turn. You keep pushing, and the flywheel
begins to move a bit faster, and with continued great effort, you move it around a second rotation. You keep
pushing in a consistent direction. Three turns, four turns, five, it builds momentum, turning faster with each turn.
Then, at some point, breakthrough. The momentum of the thing kicks in in your favor, hurling the flywheel
forward, turn after turn, its own heavy weight working for you. You're pushing no harder than during the first
rotation, but the flywheel goes faster and faster. Each turn of the flywheel builds upon work done earlier,
compounding your investment of effort. The huge heavy disk flies forward, with almost unstoppable momentum."
That's where we are. Back in 2008, this firm to take the market share from larger, more bureaucratic banks by
taking their best bankers and having to move the best clients from their previous employers to us. To steal
another Jim Collins phrase, that's our Hedgehog Strategy. The second one we revert to over and over and over
and over. No doubt, it was harder back then. I still remember hiring Larry Moore before we ever opened our doors

in 2000. And then on the first day of business have opened accounts for [ph] Doug Kennedy, who owns Kennedy
Resin and Supply. (00:18:19). He's a long time client and our previous employer. They were our very first client.
They're still our client to this day. And now the same is rolling forward with astounding momentum. In 2Q alone,
we grew loan almost $2 billion. We pushed total assets through $40 billion, an incredible growth story by
anybody's measure.
Our ability to hire the best bankers only improves as we go, and our ability to assist into moving their clients only
improves as we go. In the last three years, we've extended on a de novo basis to Atlanta, Huntsville, Birmingham
and Washington, D.C., some of the largest fastest growing markets in the Southeast. We're hiring record numbers
of bankers and wealth managers, both in the new and existing markets. We've hired 334 revenue producers since
2019, that's a 60% increase, a huge lift in the market share moving capacity. 218 of those revenue producers are
bankers, traditional relationship managers. We hired 71 in 2019, 82 in 2020, and 116 in 2021. Year-to-date
through June of this year, we've hired 65, with 37 of those in Q2.
So, you can see the momentum continues to build. We're not just hiring any bankers and wealth managers. We're
hiring some of the most experienced and most highly regarded bankers in the market. Of the 37, we hired in Q2,
the average experience is 20 years, and literally the majority of them are hired from the large and more
bureaucratic banks like Wells Fargo and Truist, the 92 in those part of recruiting ground is an example, which is a
pretty good proxy for their level of training and sophistication.
And as we've seen year after year of, they're now successfully movement of class, which I believe means balance
sheet volumes have extraordinary momentum, which means core revenues have extraordinary momentum, and
half of that momentum requires limited or no assistance from a strong economy. As Jim Collins described it a
flywheel like that produces almost unstoppable momentum. And those of you who are well familiar with the
Pinnacle growth model and through the years are likely comfortable with the growth, the idea of hiring long
experienced relationship managers, we've been handling both clients for decades and having moved those clients
to Pinnacle will result in strong loan quality based on the unusual approach of client selection, simply these very
experienced bankers they move on with the best clients and leave problem assets behind.
All right. I probably spare you the detailed explanation on the length of deploying the associate experience, client
experience and shareholder return, other than to remind you how it relates to why our momentum is so strong.
There's overwhelmingly compelling data developed by Gallup, the best place to work institute. And any number of
others would demonstrates this idea of beginning with an exciting associate experience and translating that into a
client experience that yields [indiscernible] (00:21:19) doesn't need fuel outside of shareholder return literally 3.33
times the Russell 3000 since 1998.
While some banks are hoping to catch whatever the next wave might be, rising rates, falling rates, whatever,
we've been diligently building an infrastructure that I believe has and again continue to produce outsize
shareholder returns over the long-term, cycle in and cycle out.
Our associate engagement is literally among the best employers in the country, it's long-standing, it's across
virtually every associate group like women, millennials, parents, and across our entire footprint in virtually every
major market.
Building on that foundation, these excited associates are hiring well with clients, our Net Promoter Score is market
leading in both our Tennessee and North Carolina footprint, an extremely high ranking in every metropolitan
market [indiscernible] (00:22:13) large amount of shares produced and [indiscernible] (00:22:15).

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
And on the far right, you can see that we have substantially translated all that focus on our associates and clients
on the shareholder value, the longer term shareholder returns have been outsized from beginning and over 10-
years, 5-year, and 3-years' time horizons. Though our return this year has not been immune from the broader
pressures on the sector, I still expect over the longer term, Pinnacle's culture should continue to produce outsized
returns.
And then finally, one more reason as to why line spending's so fast, I want to discuss briefly, on how I get paid
and frankly how the top 140 leaders in this firm are in their short- and long-term incentives. I've already spent a
little time on the variables that we believe is most correlated to shareholder value. Now, here you see the
variables that determine our short-term incentive on top and our long-term incentives on the bottom, which is
intended to help you see how the leadership of this firm is aligned with shareholders, and therefore, they did to
outrun peers.
In the case of the short-term incentive, the variables, our asset quality, EPS growth, and PPNR growth. For most
of our existence, instead of PPNR, the third variable has been revenue growth, it appears likely these where
PPNR growth becomes really critical, we've substituted it for revenue growth. I will say that, right now, it's my
intent to ask our compensation committees to return to revenue growth probably next year.
So, these are the metrics; asset quality is a threshold venture. If we missed the classified asset ratio gap, which
we believe is most predictable of the potential asset quality metrics in terms of future loan losses, nobody gets
paid their annual cash incentive, nobody. So, the entire leadership of this firm and frankly the entire associate
base of this firm cannot afford a meaningful slip on credit. It shapes our behavior in good times and in bad, a
shareholder alignment. Assuming we cleared the asset quality threshold, actual incentives payouts determined by
EPS growth and ordinarily revenue growth, but as I just mentioned for the last few years, we've substituted PPNR
for revenue.
With those metrics, of course, the next question, would be as well how the actual performance target is set for
these metrics? In general, we utilize consensus estimates for our peers' EPS growth and ensure that our target
would be at least the top quartile. And then we take the revenue growth required to hit the EPS target. So in
quarters like this, where you get a meaningful increase in EPS, we get an increase in incentive expense, and a
better reduction in EPS this quarter and most likely we've got a reduction in the incentive expense, which then
serves to bolster the reported EPS, again a high shareholder alignment?
So, for short-term incentives to be earned by anyone at Pinnacle, historically, we had to clear an asset quality
metric and the actual payouts are a function of hitting earnings and revenue targets that were established with the
intent of being a top quartile bank, that's completed.
But it's one of the most important reasons in my judgment while the earnings growth of this firm and the share
price performance of this firm is so consistently expands to outperform peers over the long term, as you just saw
on the previous slide.
And you've seen the measure for long-term incentives on the bottom of the slide, disclosure is about how the
equity base long-term incentive works and slight modifications made year-to -ear. If you can see, in general,
tangible book value accretion is one of the most important metrics in recent years. And all these measures we
have to outrun the peers, so it's not just getting lucky. We have to outrun the peers, that makes plenty of
[indiscernible] (00:26:02) tangible book value dilution in the first quarter, virtually all of the peers experienced
substantially more tangible book value dilution than we did.

My guess is you'll see more of that in this quarter. And so, understanding this, you're not only beginning to
understand [indiscernible] (00:26:17) in the large amount of excess liquidity, if anything other than loans, just pick
up few basis points of margin, winning the pre-tangible book value and then the rates better than our peers. But
you also begin to see why using things like asset sensitivity and deposit cost base may be misleading since they
assume that no management actions to alter the forecast outcome, this management team is literally every
incentive dollar for outcome as situations change and I believe we've got a long track record of doing that
specifically.
So, where to from here? Right now, it's obviously a difficult time for bank stocks. The bank stocks, in general, I
think rapid growers in particular. In terms of PNFP it kind of reminds me this conversation I had over a good
number of years with what is today one of our largest shareholders, for years, she came to every conference, and
met with us every time, and then I love your stories, but the stock is just too expensive.
I actually said to one time, you always say it's too expensive. But every time we meet, it's more expensive than
the last time, [indiscernible] (00:27:26) jump in, otherwise I get the opportunity on the PNFP.
Well, following one of the previous downturn to bank stocks, she tells me that there's a very significant change on
PNFP, well today I'm one of your largest shareholders. This leads likewise to say market [indiscernible] (00:27:42)
now. For every [indiscernible] (00:27:46) has collapsed the shockingly near Great Recession low, and not only
that, but the traditionally wide premium, the peer multiples that Pinnacle has enjoyed is almost non-existent. And
so, it would appear to me that this might be a buying opportunity, not dissimilar to the one I just described.
The one thing I know is I'm not in charge of P/E multiples. I'm responsible to create long-term shareholder value
irrespective of the cycle. And so, my approach to delivering on that is, number one, to focus and pin down asset
quality, we have to. Not only are the leaders of this firm relatively large shareholders, but all our annual cash
incentives literally evaporate without it. This is in theory.
Number two, to continue to be stewards and refine the remarkable culture that I believe specifically lead to
outsized shareholder return is a competitive advantage in both good times and bad.
Number three, to continue to emphasize being the best place to work. We've become a magnet for talent and are
successfully recruiting some of the best talents in Southeast and in large quantities. I've used this phrase before,
this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to amass talent that Pinnacle is uniquely suited to seize.
Number four, to continue building market share momentum of this firm. Honestly, it would be difficult to constrain.
You can see why Collins referred it to as almost unstoppable. We've added 334 revenue producers just in 2019.
That's a 60% increase in revenue producers; a.k.a., market share taking capacity. We expect these revenue
producers to continue to consolidate their clients to Pinnacle, while they seem to leave their problem credits
behind. And with that approach, you get a rapid growth and strong asset quality.
And number five, to double down on wowing our clients in respect to cycles over the long-term, great places to
work, produced greater than 3x the returns of companies that are not on that list because they can leverage the
associate's excitement to create raving fans, which is probably the most important in creating long-term
shareholder value creation.
And, in fact, we're actually increasing the interest there believing that as so many competitors wrestle how to deal
with COVID, work from home, labor shortages, supply chain issues and any number of other excuses, we can see

this time to further differentiate an already differentiated brand by continuing to enrich our associates and blow our
clients away. And all that's aimed at rapid reliable growth in revenue and EPS cycle-in and cycle-out.
So with all of that content, I'll turn it over to Harold to review the second quarter in greater de
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. Obviously, the second quarter was one of the strongest loan growth
quarters for us after following a very strong first quarter and what we believe will be a strong year for loan growth
overall as we now target a 2022 loan growth percentage of high-teens to low-20s for this year.
Loan yields were up in the second quarter due to, obviously, the rate hikes. Thus far, our loan beta is growing
about 2x what our deposit beta has been since the tightening cycle began in March. We anticipate further
escalation of loan yields as rate increases occur during rest of the year.
PPP is largely in the rearview mirror. One of the headwinds really going into 2022 was overcoming the significant
revenues that PPP provided us over the last two-plus years. The key components [indiscernible] (00:31:11) earlier
in the year Street earnings estimates for 2022, we're anticipating decreases in EPS for us for this year.
In 2021, we reported $81 million in revenues for PPP, compared to $15 million thus far this year. Our relationship
managers have done a phenomenal job in deploying part of the loans from other banks. And as a result, we've
seen revenue estimates steadily climb in 2022. We responded to a lot of questions about loan floors over the past
year or so and their impact on our yields in a rising rate environment.
As the bottom of that chart on the slide indicates, we have only $110 million of our floating rate loans left. So on
loan floors, like PPP, loan floors are essentially in the rearview mirror for now. Our rough, rough estimate is that
loan floors contributed some $50 million of revenues over the last year or so.
Lastly, as Terry mentioned, our new markets including Atlanta and our new specialty lending units provided
approximately $530 million in loan growth, while our newer relationship managers contributed $430 million this
quarter. We believe the execution of our strategy is in full effect and look forward to when we can get a more
positive economic backdrop than what exists today. As we started reviewing our second quarter loan growth, we
decided that it might be helpful to better understand the source of the growth. So hopefully, this slide is that
helpful.
We characterize our growth into four broader segments: one, our pure asset generation play with BHG, Advocate,
JB&B; and then, two, our strategic market expansions, Raleigh, Atlanta, DC, Birmingham, but also expansion of
the specialty lending group like franchise and equipment lending; and then, three, what sort of growth did we
achieve from our recruiting. So this is the growth of our newer RMs that have been with us for only 2.5 years or
less; and then, finally, the fourth, the legacy markets contribution.
So all this is net through. Thus far, through the first six months, we had experienced 25% of our loan growth
annualized between December 31 and June 30, 2022, which is inclusive of PPP paydowns, which is denoted in
red on this slide. Almost 50% of our loan growth is from our legacy markets, while the rest is primarily from new
ideas and new people. We felt like this was helpful as we try to understand where all of this fantastic loan growth
has originated.

Now, onto deposits. For the first time in a few years, our deposit growth stalled. We were encouraged about what
happened during the quarter once the month of April was over, mainly giving us some reason to be optimistic.
And we're also optimistic about noninterest-bearing deposits growing during the quarter. As we all know, these
accounts become increasingly valuable as rates increase.
Since the tightening cycle began, our deposit rates were up almost 34 basis points. So we're, obviously, pleased
with the effort of our relationship managers thus far. We've never abandoned our view that core deposit growth is
a key long-term strategic objective and, as a result, it's all hands on deck currently.
For the first 20-plus years of our existence, our number one objective was developing strategies and tactics
around funding our growth. We continue to like our chances given the significant investments we've made both on
relationship managers and new markets over the last few years.
We continue to believe an aggregate 40% beta of deposit rates through the end of 2022 is likely. We also keep an
eye on what our competitors are doing given they are advertising much lower betas, which we believe gives us
some breathing room, at least, currently.
Now, to liquidity. Our liquid assets decreased this quarter corresponding with strong loan growth, modest deposit
growth and a $400 million increase in securities, all of which were floating rate. With our outlook for loan growth,
we likely will not see any increased deployment of liquidity into bonds over the next several quarters.
As the top-left chart reflects, with the tightening cycle, our GAAP NIM increased 28 basis points this quarter. The
impact of PPP and liquidity had a meaningfully less impact on our NIM this quarter, and we anticipate further
reductions in the impact of these two items over the next several quarters.
Presently, we have confidence that we should see margin expansion along with increased net interest income in
3Q and 4Q. Concurrently, we're upping our guidance from low-20% to the high-teens growth for the full year 2022
over the last year.
As to credit, we are again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform
very well. And again, these are some of the best credit metric ratios we have experienced ever.
Not sure if anyone cares to hear about this anymore, but modifications made pursuant to the Section 4013 of the
CARES Act continue to decrease, and were down to $626 million at June 30, down from $827 million earlier this
year. Importantly, 97% of our Section 4013 credits are on some form of principal interest monthly pay with only
1% in a classified risk category.
Importantly, given the current outlook, we believe we will see further declines in our allowance for credit losses to
total loan ratio over the next several quarters, albeit at a slower pace than we would have otherwise projected a
couple of quarters ago. Our current ACL was 1.03%, which compares to a pre-CECL, pre-COVID reserve of
0.48% at December 31, 2019. So as we start this tightening cycle, we feel like we're in a pretty good shape given
the quality of our portfolio currently.
I wrestled this chart out of our credit officers and the information here I'll say is maybe obvious, but I do believe is
helpful in the detailing our appetite for the various sub segments in construction and investment property. As the
left chart indicates, we have little appetite for the asset classes and the red portion and remain receptive to those
asset classes in the main areas. More importantly, is the information on the right side of the chart. I don't know if

any of this information blue box is all that moved, but it does signal to our RMs in the fields or expect more
diligence, more questions, more analysis, which we all believe is the right thing to do right now.
I won't spend a lot of time on these expenses. We've had more information on the slides to help [ph] our builders
(00:37:45). As always, I will speak to DHG in few minutes, which obviously, we had announced last quarter. You
can further see evidence of our [indiscernible] (00:37:54) year-over-year increases in brokerage income of 46%,
trustee to 20% and insurance commissions of 6%. Second quarter fees were benefited by increased interchange,
particularly in commercial credit cards. We believe this will subside somewhat going into second half of 2022.
We booked about $5 million in [indiscernible] (00:38:14) gains in the second quarter based on recent valuation
adjustments as companies in which these funds or investments continue to issue. Capital markets had about $2
million in gains this quarter. Their pipeline is good with [indiscernible] (00:38:27) we just had best right now. As to
expenses, we are maintaining our overall total expense run rate of approximately mid-teen percentage growth in
2022 in comparison to 2021. This is primarily attributable to head count growth in the new markets, market
disruption across our markets, which will lead to strong recurring opportunities and the addition of JB&B.
In additional, we now believe that we should anticipate hitting our maximum payout of 125% of target for our
annual cash incentive plan. We do believe the second quarter total expense is a decent run rate for the remainder
of the year, and we have some reasonable that we could see [ph] cost write up some in (00:39:09) 2Q, but the
inflation backdrop could wreck that thought. We also think we have a good expense number forecasted for head
count growth in the second half of this year. We will just have to see how our recruiting pipeline remains
exceptionally strong further.
As to capital, tangible book value did increase to $42.08 from $41.65 last quarter. Our decision to move
approximately $1.5 billion of [indiscernible] (00:39:37) helped our tangible book value per share by approximately
$0.50 per share at June 30. We do not anticipate any other significant capital actions at this time.
Quickly, here's an update on our outlook for 2022. For loans, we've increased our outlook to high teens to low
20s. We are adjusting our rate forecast and now consider 3.25% Fed fund rate by year-end. We want you – we'll
continue to monitor and modify as necessary.
Given that, we believe we should see continued improvement in net interest income this year, which should result
in net interest income growth in the high teens. We still believe our expense outlook for increased tariffs and other
factors is in the mid-teens percent of growth range, but given where we are today, it will not likely be less than
that. We are very optimistic about hiring, and we are thinking we're going to have a modest – really strong
recruiting year.
So as the PPNR and third quarter run rate, we anticipate strong growth in net interest income, while run rate for
fees taking out BHG and basing income could be slightly higher, but probably flattish and expenses should be
flattish for us. While provision, a key driver, we believe will be on growth for the third quarter. Obviously, inflation
in the macro environment will ultimately determine how all of this turns out. For our group, we will work with an
intense focus and do what we need to do to grow the franchise value of this firm.
Now a few comments on BHG. BHG had another record quarter on originations. We anticipated that BHG would
increase sales under their bank network as the capital markets has been volatile while their bank platform
continues to be super reliable, which is obviously one of their competitive benefits that BHG can pivot and perform
as a bank network and the securitization network during times such as these.

Spreads on loans sold through the open platform did contract slightly in the second quarter from the last few
quarters, which had some of the widest spreads in their history with rate driving spread will likely head back to
historical loans of around 9% or so. The bottom right chart details, the 1,400 plus banks in BHG's networking and
just over 600 unique buyers in the last 12 months. As you know, we consider the funding platform will be one of
our strongest, if not the strongest platform in the company for a company that execute a broad-based revenue
platform.
As you know, the recourse obligation is a reserve for potential loss absorption for the loan portfolio. At the end of
the second quarter, BHG increased their resources grew to $247 million, up $27 million from the first quarter while
the ratio of the recourse obligation to some loans decreased modestly to 4.98%. As the blue bars in the bottom
right show credit loss portion of recourse losses for the second quarter remained somewhat lowest levels in the
past 10 years.
Additionally, as shown in the supplemental information and deal macro environment, BHG also increased its
reserve for on balance sheet loans by about $18 million to approximately $75 million as of June 24. That reserve
is now at 3% from 2.5% last quarter. These reserves increased through credit -these reserves increased both
credit metrics remain persistent and in some cases are approved. BHG based on their opinion of macro
environment, increased these reserve positions with a view for [indiscernible] (00:43:12). We obviously
implemented cost cuts this year. That said, we are really pleased with BHG's second quarter, especially at the
same struggles that other more well-known fintech lenders appear to be going through right now.
The quality of BHG [indiscernible] (00:43:28) and we believe one of our strongest attributes. BHG [indiscernible]
(00:43:34), always looking for weakness in its borrowing base. Past dues and [indiscernible] (00:43:39) were at
consistent levels with previous quarters, so their borrowers have remained resilient through credit cycle thus far.
National unemployment forecast given the confidence that their borrowers should be able to withstand forecasted
inflationary increase in the way that allows BHG to better weather in this environment than other lenders in inter
space. In comparison to other lenders, we believe BHG's borrowers are well paid with average earnings being
approximately $287,000 annually. They believe in the credit models and their experience gives them the reason
to do so.
Lastly, BHG had a record operating quarter in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, with the volatility in
rates in the earlier part of the year, BHG has consistently earnings in the earlier quarters of 2022 would likely be
stronger as they sell more loans to the bank option platform ever hold along with our balance sheet and to better
understand how the securitization markets will behave.
As you know, the bank option platform delivers immediate annual sales recognition through securitization network
where there's interest income over the life of the loan. As said, we were able to accomplish during a $300 million
securitization at an acceptable rate of 5.5% when as appear to us other fintech that we have to reevaluate their
business models given the operating environment. BHG has very pleased to be able to get the securities
accomplished and anticipate potentially one to two more securitizations this year.
BHG has also increased their loan production assumption for 2022 and that ways the banking partnership drove
40% growth in originations this year in comparison to last year. As 2022 earnings, BHG believe that 2022
earnings should now represent about 15% growth in 2021, which Pinnacle required reductions in the quarter run
rates in comparison to the second quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Three key points I'd like to emphasize or reemphasize that gives us a whole earnings growth is now 15% to 2022.
Credit remains consistent from previous quarters with BHG and will likely be increasing reserves based on
macroeconomic factors at least over the next quarter or so. Spread sprint is likely going occurring line with more
historical levels as we get into the second half. Spread remains historically high currently, but with increased rate
forecast shrinkage in earnings could occur.
Production volumes are very strong, and we believe that we'll continue to have strong production going into the
second half of the year, but BHG will aim to send more to the securitization platform, which reduces current period
profits accordingly. Of note that the BHG anticipate at least two funding alternatives to open up in the near term
as they speak to broader already strong orbit platform, which we also believe is one of our strongest attributes. As
you all know, we are strong leaders in the BHG franchise. So we think a 15% growth with a more conservative
outlook is the right thing to do for right now.
With that, operator, I will stop and ask for you to look for or ask for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. I would now like to ask a question – [Operator Instructions] Our first question

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Also just it's pretty tough to hear you. I'm not sure if your microphone is covered up or something, but it's been
difficult to hear during the call. But I guess on the first question on the deposit growth. As we as we look at slide
15 and we see the breakdown of loan growth by different categories, is it similar on the deposit growth side? And
do you think that there's going to be an opportunity to maybe see expansion or acceleration of growth from the
more recent expansion on deposits as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're optimistic about what our deposit growth will look for the second half of the year. Traditionally,
our deposit growth does come in, in the back half of the year, so we're thinking we like to see that occur. We think
our newer recruits and our new markets are beginning to deliver a more consistent deposit growth here as they
gain some more experience with the firm. So, yeah, I think we do anticipate more growth in deposits from our
newer people and newer markets.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then as we look at that through the year, how should we think about your comfort level with where the loan-
to-deposit ratio can grow to and also with how low cash can go as a percentage of assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We still believe we've got quite a bit of cash to fund loan growth to try and get down to kind of what that –
there is a chart in the slide deck it shows what our cash balances were kind of pre-COVID. As to the loan-to-
deposit ratio, we operated this firm for a long time at nearly, call it, 95% to 98%. I don't know if we'll get back to
that level, but we've definitely got some room to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then finally from me, just on BHG, did you see any – as we look at the end of the quarter and
going into July, has the fear of recession or higher rates had a dramatic change in the appetite for bank or on the
appetite for paper from the banks? Is that really reflective of the potential slowdown in the second half of growth
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No. I think the bank network remains active and receptive. I think what will happen in the second half of the year
is it will get more competitive, to be honest. And they will work hard to try to get a couple of securitizations done.
Would you take money away from the bank network? So, as a result, the auction platform becomes a lot more
competitive.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to first follow up on the [indiscernible] (00:50:49). So, assuming that you guys delivered the 2002 loan
growth guidance there calling out, how should we start think about 2023? And I'm not going to [indiscernible]
(00:51:01) guidance, but should we think about that as a more typical year for you guys, like low-double-digit
growth or the momentum that you're – I mean, Terry called it out quite a few times. Could it be another outsized
growth just given all this momentum you're pointing to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, I might stress is that, again, the – I guess the thing I keep trying to make sure people understand is our
hiring momentum is strong. And as you know, we've built well over a four, five-year period. So when you look at
the number of people that we've hired since 2019, that grows more outside growth in there. But don't miss that
we're continuing to hire and the hire momentum this year is higher than last year. The hiring momentum in the
second quarter is higher than the first quarter. And so, I think Harold used the phrase that our hiring pipeline is all
substantial. And so, yeah, that is what I'll drive both the balance sheet growth and the [indiscernible] (00:52:07)
growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And I want to drill down further into your response to Jared's question. If we
assume deposit growth becomes more of a challenge for the entire [indiscernible] (00:52:20), I think we're seeing
some banks wanting to get ahead of that, bring in more deposits now. Harold, was your response to Jared's
question implying that you guys plan to [indiscernible] (00:52:31) your excess liquidity, go back to where the
deposit ratio was historically, call it, 95%, 98% and then you'll start fully funding loan growth with deposits? Is that
your plan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think that would be exactly what our plan is. I think they'll run concurrently. But yes, we do plan to try
to bring liquidity down over the next, call it, six to nine months. But that, in and of itself, we don't think is the right
thing. We will focus our troops on core deposit growth. And like I said, it will be all hands on deck to get that done.
We've got several deposit kind of tactics in play right now, and we'll try to add resources to that to make sure that
we can continue to fund the growth that we anticipate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the deposit betas, Terry, you made the point that you thought betas
would be lower than the prior cycle. You called out a couple of reasons. So maybe, Harold, what are we thinking
now? What is the assumed total deposit beta to be assuming through the cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're still leaning in on a 40% beta by the end of the year, so we still are not willing to come off that.
We're hopeful that we will deliver less than that, obviously. And so far, so good on that front. But we also think that

75 basis points here in July and [indiscernible] (00:54:12) through the rest of the year as we get to that 3.25% kind
of Fed fund rate that we're targeting that we'll see increased deposit rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And I just want to understand – sorry to put another question here, but you're also assuming that your loan
beta is above your deposit beta, and that's what's driving NIM expansion. It's just not [indiscernible] (00:54:34)
yielding cash into loans, right? You're assuming loan beta continues to stay up ahead of the deposit beta. Is that
right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We've been – yeah, for sure. We've been really pleased with how loan yields have responded here early in
the cycle. I think our – kind of our test rate is probably running 100% so far. So every loan that's eligible for a loan
rate increase, I think we're getting it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. So maybe just following down on maybe Steven's last question around what you're
seeing on the loan side. And, obviously, you guys lay out the slide 34, showing us weighted average yields and
then what your new yields are. And it seemed like there was a particularly strong move in the fixed rate yields
quarter-over-quarter. Is that just what you said, Harold, is when re-pricing is necessary, like you're getting a high
hit rate? Or what do you think is driving the success there? Because I can't say that so far through the earnings
season I've seen that from other banks. It's really impressive, the 67 basis points on higher fixed rate loan yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I appreciate the question, Stephen, because we've been talking about fixed rate loan yields and making
sure that new credit will keep up for a long time. And so, I appreciate your comment. I hope that none of our other
relationship managers heard the comment, but I appreciate it because we're going to keep beating on making
sure the fixed rate loans continue to go up. And I hope that we can see that what we've been – to be candid,
we've been a little disappointed in where fixed rate loan yields have been thus far in the cycle. So we're hopeful
that we can still see some more escalation in those yields.

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the share repurchase, I think the comment was somewhere in the
presentation maybe or in the release that no anticipation of using any of that $125 million. But obviously, Terry,
you highlighted what you think is another great opportunity for the stock for investors. So is there a level here
where that becomes a viability for you guys? Or is it just with all the growth, you want to continue to hold the
capital for growth, not the repurchase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's absolutely the point. As we look at our not only our recruiting pipelines, our business development
pipelines, loan, deposit, fees, we think we've got a lot of opportunity in front of us. I don't think the third quarter
loan growth number is as high as the second quarter loan growth number, but there's a lot of momentum going.
And so, we're going to try to reserve capital for longer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, just last one for me is around BHG. And I'm curious or just wondering if you can give any
additional color on numbers around the CECL impact moving forward, if you guys have any updated data there? If
I remember correctly, I thought it was – some of the securitizations would cause a higher CECL impact.
Obviously, that's selling through the bank platform. So just wondering what you have there in terms of numbers
and how that might impact maybe 2023 on the BHG side of things?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. CECL will impact BHG for the fourth quarter of next year. So they'll adopt on October
1. They're running various credit models. They're looking at various, call it, funding platforms that are applicable to
CECL and not applicable to CECL.
Right now, the securitization network, the way it's currently designed, would have to be CECL-compliant. So we'll
probably be giving out more information on that here at the end of the third quarter. They're reworking their
models, trying to get them in shape. So 2023's impact probably won't be that significant. 2024 is where they have
to go full seasonal model. But again, I think they will be designing different funding mechanisms with capital
markets to better navigate CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. This is Matt. I want to ask more about loan growth. Really impressive loan
growth numbers in 2Q. You guys gave us some good details on kind of the drivers. The guidance implies a
slowdown the back half of the year, and I think a lot of your peers are also talking about a slowdown in the back
half of the year. But we'd love to hear more about your outlook for loan growth at the back half of the year. Are
pipelines slowing? Just trying to get sense of how much conservatism is baked in here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Matt, my sense is [indiscernible] (01:00:20) a quarter is probably not the best ongoing assumption, that's a way
with the quarter. I'm not saying we won't have that from time-to-time, but I don't think that's sort of the expected
run rate, we think we really did have a fabulous quarter. I don't look for a huge slowdown. In other words, I don't
think it's really slow in economic activity or slow in market share movement as much as it is. Just a little more
normalization in the second half than what you saw there in the second quarter [indiscernible] (01:00:53) really
sort of an extraordinary number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the expense side, the 2Q expense is a little elevated this quarter, but the guidance was
unchanged. Anything that was at a higher accrual in 2Q? And if I'm interpreting that guidance correctly, it implies
that the 2Q expense levels could be the peak and which could be flattish from here, [indiscernible] (01:01:21)
about that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. I think that's what we believe today is that expenses will be pretty flat for the rest of the year. 2Q
was elevated primarily based on incentives and, call it, the increased earnings that we experienced here in the
second quarter dictated a higher kind of allocation of incentives from the back half of the year towards the front
half of the year. So, that's primarily [indiscernible] (01:01:54).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just lastly on BHG, I want to make sure I appreciate the updated guidance. Does this now
assume that 9% spread that you mentioned earlier was a more normalized level? And then secondly, what does
this assume as far as what percent of your originations will be placed on the bank network for the back half of the
year? I think it was around two-thirds a level on 2Q. Just curious if you're going to stick with that same kind of
numbers in the back half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think they will rationalize the numbers that I looked at and we didn't disclose them, but the numbers I
looked at would say that the bank networks are probably going to be cut more or less in half, maybe down to two-
thirds of what they got in the second quarter.

Matt Olney Q

And the spreads, Harold?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
On the spread comments, you're absolutely right. We think this is going to probably approach 9% here over the
last half of year. I'm sorry. I forgot you asked that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q

Okay, guys, congrats. Thanks again.

Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just another one on BHG, so I appreciate all the
commentary as it relates to the guidance for the back half of the year. But as we think about 2023 with those
spreads compressing maybe a little bit more allocated to the recourse reserve, is BHG actually think that they can
grow pre-tax earnings next year with those dynamics in place? I know they're building out some different verticals
and expanding within some existing verticals, but it may be a little bit early. But just wanted to get a sense if it's in
the realm of expectations that pre-tax earnings at BHG could actually grow next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Mike, that's a great question. Our belief in talking to BHG is they have no intent to roll back earnings growth
in any kind of meaningful way. Now, like we talked about here on the call, we're looking at 15% growth in 2022.
So using that as kind of a benchmark, I don't think they're looking at any material kind of change there. That said,
this is the time of the year when they begin to look at 2023 and the impact of some of these, like you said, new
verticals, how that's going. They're going to be looking at how their bank debt loans performing, reduce spreads
or going back to the higher spreads in a more, call it, a better backdrop as for in the economy is concerned. But
I'm not hearing anything from them that says they're going to try and take their foot off the accelerator.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
So, if I heard you right, and I'm not trying to pin you down here, but 15-percentage-ish range for next year is in the
realm of possibilities. Is that what you're trying to convey?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Yeah. I think so. I've not gotten any word from them that there will be any less than that. But again, they're going
through that. They'll be going through all of those processes here in the third and into the fourth quarter. So I'll
have a better idea for you in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Appreciate it. And then just going back to the deposit costs and betas. If I look at the spot rate at the end of
the quarter, it was 67 bps, and I appreciate the commentary that you expect loan betas will be higher than deposit
betas. But it does, in theory, with a couple more rate hikes, a pretty high magnitude, imply pretty healthy growth in
deposit cost. Do you think after this gap-up that we get in the third quarter that we're kind of nearing at least a
nearer-term peak and that you can still see margin expansion a few quarters beyond when the Fed stops raising?
Again, just trying to kind of deconstruct the betas on both sides of the balance sheet. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's right. We believe that deposit rates – thus far, we think our beta on deposits is somewhere
around 22% as of yesterday. We think that with rate increases coming in the last part of the year that we'll see an
escalation because you've got to in order get to that 40% for the whole year. And so we're trying to give ourselves
some room to operate there.
On the loan side, thus far, we're not seeing any pushback at all with respect to those loans that are tied to any
sort of Primes, SOFR, LIBOR or whatever. Those increased loan yields were getting past declines and so far,
we're getting that – getting those yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Maybe one final one for me, just more broadly, probably for Terry. The Atlanta expansion obviously
impacted by COVID, can we just get an update there? And then can you give us more of an update on D.C. and
maybe what the expectations could be for growth contribution as we move into next year, really for both of those
new expansions on a combined basis? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think as it relates to COVID, we, like everywhere, I think, have seen a spike in our footprint. We have seen
an elevated number of cases in our associate base. But I guess I'm going to say it this way, happily, there is
nothing particularly severe. Some of the people are getting COVID or getting it for the second or even third time
and many of them are vaccinated and so forth. So, the consequences have not been particularly severe. But
clearly, our associate cases have stepped up over the last 30 days or so.
I think in terms of D.C., Michael, how that's going to work, you hire the people that are beginning to call on clients,
that are beginning to book commitments and then it takes a while for commitments to turn into funding. But I
would say it this way, that based on where they are in the coming cycle, where they are in the commitment cycle,
meaning [indiscernible] (01:08:56) legal commitments closed loan agreements yet to fund, I'm really excited about
the D.C. And my guess is over a 12, 18 to 24-month period, it'll be our fastest growing unit. We're very excited
and encouraged by the book of business that's developing there.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Mike, last on Atlanta, I think your question was headed to that basically their first year in operations were the
COVID year. And are we thinking that we're going to back off on our $3 billion bank in five-year notion. As it sits
right now, I think Atlanta could have a really strong third quarter here in this year. And so, I think our leadership
there has done a great job of pacing through COVID in a way that still, we believe, gives us a great shot at being
that $3 billion franchise, call it, by – end of 2024 or 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'm sorry, Michael. I thought your question was about D.C., but that's right about Atlanta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the team pipeline. Obviously, a pretty strong quarter here
in the second quarter with 37 producers hired. How is that shaping up in the back half? Can you guys improve
upon that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think I would be surprised sitting here today if we don't do, at least, that in the second half. But the
recruiting pipelines are full. I guess, over the years they learned you don't celebrate until they get in the seat and
so forth. But yeah, I think simple answer is, yeah, I would expect second half to probably match the first.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just on the BHG front, Harold, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like originations up 40%. That
implies an origination level a little bit higher than what we saw on the 2Q. I just was wondering if you could
confirm that, and then, any color on where spreads are in the early going here in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Casey. Yeah. The 40% growth is an escalation. I think it was – I think we talked about 30%, 35%
[indiscernible] (01:11:54) end of the first quarter. And so, I do believe they've enough kind of momentum here

going into the second half of the year that they think production will go up here in the second half. And the second
part of your question was about spreads?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Just spreads, any color on spreads in the early going here in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't have anything on July, but in the month of June, spreads were consistent with [indiscernible]
(01:12:24) number. So, they didn't see any kind of significant degradation in spreads during the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's great. Thanks. And just last one for me. I know you guys gave the fee guide for 2022. Just a
question on interchange within the other line popped up pretty nicely here in the second quarter, is that a
sustainable run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We think we've got a good shot at that. A lot of that was in our purchasing power that we delivered to
commercial clients. We think there could be some inflationary backdrop there as commercial clients build
inventories, buy things before they think prices go up again. So, I'll just put it to you like that, Casey. That's what
we think right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Thank you, guys.

Brian Martin Q

Hey. Harold, can you just talk maybe a little bit about – you talked about the liquidity you mentioned it earlier, just
kind of where do you expect that to end – kind of end up here over the next couple of quarters? It sounds like your
intent is to bring it lower, and just kind of thinking about putting that together with kind of the margin outlook given
23

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
the loan to deposit beta commentary, but just that liquidity and margin generally maybe just over the next couple
of quarters here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the second quarter as far as where we ended up, we probably took away about half of our, call it,
liquidity cushion, maybe a little more than that. So, I think we've got some more liquidity left to go get. And I think
we've got some, call it, short-term securities that we're going to call back to help that loan growth here in the third
quarter. So, we'll have a little bit of June 30 liquidity of getting used. We'll bolster it a little bit and then we'll see
where deposits shake out. So, the blue bars on slide 17 in that top right chart, I think those blue bars will come
down some, but they won't approach, call it, the first quarter of 2020 levels here in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then – okay. And then, how about just on the reserve? It sounds like the reserve coverage
ratio drops a little bit further from here, given kind of the trends you're seeing in credit quality. Is that kind of what
you guys were suggesting earlier? Maybe I missed some of the commentary there, but just kind of how that ratio
looks in the next quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
As far as our ACL is that what you're asking about, Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah, just – yeah, ACL coverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
In relation to loans, we still believe we've got opportunities to reduce it. That's based on our models that we use to
produce our CECL-related reserve. And we also – we're still adding back qualitative factors to keep it where it is.
The one point that I do want to reemphasize to you is that, call it, 2019, we were at about – the reserve was
basically in half of where it is today. So, we don't anticipate going back to that level, nor do we anticipate going
back to the day one CECL number. But we do think we've got some more room to continue to produce reserves,
which we've been steadily doing, call it, for the last six quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Okay. That's all I have. So, I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
