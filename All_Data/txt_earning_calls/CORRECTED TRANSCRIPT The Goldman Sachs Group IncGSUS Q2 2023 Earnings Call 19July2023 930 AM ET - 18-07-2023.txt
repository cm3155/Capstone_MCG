Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
recorded today, July 19, 2023. Thank you.
Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.

Chief Strategy Officer & Global Head-Investor Relations, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer at Goldman
Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings
presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information

Let me pass the call to David.

David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter, we produced net
revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our
results were impacted by several items related to businesses where we're executing on a strategic transition and
positioning the firm for the future, in particular our Asset & Wealth Management business to a less capital-
intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition.
All-in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our
results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment, and in particular, headwinds facing our specific
mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows, and clients
largely maintained a risk-off posture over the course of the quarter.
CEOs around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inflation, geopolitical
tensions and slower growth. But we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our financial
system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity. And we're
seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already, particularly equity capital markets and M&A dialogue.
There's no question recent economic data in the US indicates the Fed's efforts to fight inflation are showing
progress, and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory. However the year unfolds, we
stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and
operating the firm more efficiently.
Importantly, we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our Investor Day in February, and we are in execution
mode. We have two incredibly strong client franchises, a world-class Global Banking & Markets business, where

we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels, and a scaled Asset &
Wealth Management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our Investor Day
goals, with growth in more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending.
These businesses are supported by a number of things. First, a long track record of serving the world's leading
businesses, institutions and individuals. Building relationships as a trusted advisor is core to what Goldman Sachs
does. Next, the client-centric mindset. Over the last five years, we've strengthened our efforts to bring to bear the
best of the firm's capabilities and holistically serve clients with our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. Client
feedback continues to be highly encouraging, and we see opportunities to make further gains.
We also have a global, broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and
solutions, a key differentiator of value for our clients around the world. We have exceptional people. They're
differentiated and they work hard to make a difference for our clients. And lastly, this is all underpinned by a
culture of collaboration and excellence.
We are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business is resulting in sustained
multiyear progress. Starting in October, our SCB will be reduced by 80 basis points to 5.5%, giving us greater
flexibility to deploy our capital. We continue to execute on the $30 billion share repurchase program we
announced in February.
And we recently announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have made it a priority to grow our
dividend to a competitive rate, and since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our dividend from
$0.80 to $2.75 per share per quarter. Given our ongoing strategic efforts to lower the firm's capital density and
reduce earnings volatility, we are well positioned to grow it further.
As I said, we are laser-focused on executing on our strategy. This moment in the economic cycle creates
meaningful headwinds for Goldman Sachs and our business mix. At the same time, we are making tough
decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the firm. Given both these factors, it should come as no
surprise that we're going through a period of lower results. I remain fully confident that we will deliver on our
through-the-cycle targets of mid-teens returns and create significant value for shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter,
we generated net revenues of $10.9 billion and net earnings of $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of
$3.08. As David mentioned, we have provided additional detail this quarter on three items that impacted our
results.
These items area gain in connection with our sale process for the Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as the
business' operating results; losses from our historical principal investments within Asset & Wealth Management;
and results relating to GreenSky, including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms. In aggregate, for the
second quarter, these three items impacted net earnings by $1.4 billion and reduced our EPS by $3.95 and our
ROE by 5.2 percentage points.
Turning to performance by segment starting on page 4, Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $7.2
billion in the second quarter. Advisory revenues of $645 million were down versus a strong prior-year period amid

significantly lower industry completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $338 million, as we
saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets, although volumes continue to remain well below medium and
long-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of 2022, as activity
remains muted.
Nonetheless, our client franchise remains very strong and we remain well-positioned to support the needs of our
clients. We ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed M&A, as well as equity
underwriting and high-yield debt on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter,
primarily in advisory.
FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter as clients remained in a risk-off posture relative to an active
prior-year quarter, particularly in commodities, rates and currencies. FICC financing revenues were $622 million.
Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-on-year. Equities financing revenues were a
record $1.4 billion, as we benefited from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances. This was largely
offset by a decline in intermediation revenues, primarily in derivatives.
Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FICC and equities continues to yield results, as these activities
increase the durability of our revenue base, and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support
further growth.
Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5, revenues of $3 billion were down 4% year-over-year, primarily
driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments. Management and other fees increased 5% year-over-
year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher assets under supervision. Private banking and lending
revenues were also a record at $874 million. We continue to see positive momentum in this business as we
benefit from higher deposit balances and NII. Results were supported by a gain of approximately $100 million
related to the sale of substantially all the remaining Marcus loans portfolio.
Equity investments generated losses of $403 million. More specifically, we had roughly $305 million of net losses
in our private portfolio, primarily due to markdowns on investments in office-related commercial real estate, and
approximately $100 million of net losses in our public portfolio, largely driven by a loss related to a historical
principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter. Importantly, we have now reduced the public portfolio
to approximately $1 billion, down from more than $4.5 billion in 2021. Debt investments revenues were $197
million, with the year-over-year decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments.
This quarter, we also experienced approximately $485 million of impairments on our real estate-related CIE
portfolio, which are reflected in operating expenses. In aggregate, the results from Marcus loans and the losses
from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately 15
percentage points for the first half of the year.
Now moving to page 6, total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven
by $30 billion of market appreciation, as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 22nd
consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows.
Turning now to page 7 on alternatives, alternative assets under supervision totaled $267 billion at the end of the
second quarter, driving $521 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising
was $11 billion for the quarter and $25 billion for the first half of the year. Total third-party fundraising since our
2020 Investor Day is now over $200 billion and remain very well-positioned to achieve our 2024 target of $225
billion.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $53 billion, of which $24 billion is related to our
historical principal investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we reduced this portfolio by $3.6 billion, which
included sales of a number of CRE-related investments, bringing year-to-date reductions to approximately $6
billion, and putting us well on pace to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment
portfolio below $15 billion.
Next, Platform Solutions on page 8. Revenues were $659 million, driven by growth in loan balances in consumer
platforms. As noted earlier, we took a $504 million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer
platforms this quarter in connection with our exploration of a potential sale of the GreenSky business. We will
continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment, and should we decide to sell the business, we will also make a
determination regarding moving GreenSky to held-for-sale, similar to the action we took last quarter with respect
to our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. We will share further updates as appropriate.
Additionally, you will recall that in our Investor Day earlier this year, we said that we expected to reduce the
efficiency ratio in Platform Solutions below 100% by the end of this year, and we are making progress. Absent the
impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms, the efficiency ratio for this segment year-to-date would
have been better than our stated goal.
On page 9, firmwide net interest income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-
end was $178 billion, unchanged versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses
was $615 million. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net charge-offs in
our lending portfolio within consumer platforms. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments and a
reserve build were partially offset by releases due to lower balances.
Moving on to page 10, we've added a new slide this quarter providing additional detail on our CRE exposure.
Starting with the left side of the page, CRE loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending
book, roughly 15%, and we are well-diversified by property type with only 1% in the office category. Moving to the
right side of the page, you can see additional detail on our CRE-related on-balance sheet alternative investments.
We conducted a comprehensive asset by asset review of this portfolio this quarter and we've incorporated the
feedback from our sell-down process.
Office-related exposure represents approximately 2% of the aggregate portfolio in equity securities, loans and
debt securities and approximately 15% of the CIE investments and other category, net of financings. Overall, the
CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than
1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Furthermore, 50% of these investments are historical
principal investments that we intend to exit over the medium-term. We continue to remain highly focused on the
overall risk management of this portfolio.
Turning to expenses on page 11, total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date
compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34%, which includes approximately $260 million of year-to-date
severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies
to be achieved this year, and we have now largely reached this target, with line of sight to surpass it.
Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion. The increase in our non-compensation expense was
entirely driven by the CIE and goodwill impairments I discussed previously. Absent these items, non-comp
expense is down for the second consecutive quarter, even in the face of inflationary headwinds. Our effective tax

rate for the first half of 2023 was 22.3%, largely as a result of an increase in taxes on non-US earnings. For the
full year, we expect a tax rate of roughly 22%.
Next, capital on slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of the second quarter under the
standardized approach, which is 190 basis points over our new 13% requirement that will become applicable in
October. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain confident that
our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our SCB over time. The 80
basis point reduction in our SCB will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to
support our client franchise.
In the quarter, we've returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $750 million
and common stock dividends of $864 million. Our board has also approved a 10% increase in our dividend to
$2.75 per share beginning in the third quarter. This increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable
growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield, complemented by our previously announced $30 billion share
repurchase program, where we intend to step-up the level of buybacks going forward.
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect a challenging backdrop, as well as our ongoing execution of
several strategic actions. These initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return profile.
We remain confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain
optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. So, I want to talk about how we build towards the medium-term ROE target. So, obviously, for this
quarter, it was depressed by the write-downs. Let's start with a 9-ish starting point. We know capital markets
activity will be better in normal times. So, I know we're a lot closer than it looks right now.
If you look at page 7, where [indiscernible] (00:17:34) you spelled out the $3.6 billion of historical principal
investments that declined in the quarter, or if you want to do it year-to-date, either way. My question related to that
reducing capital intensity is, in a good way, it didn't look like there was a big gain or a loss related to those exits.
A, is that right? And B, how much capital [ph] or RWA (00:17:56) did you free up, because I'm just trying to build
towards that ultimate goal? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Glenn, thank you for the question. And I think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns,
there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at
Investor Day, as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efficiency. The capital efficiency has been a project
that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had particular increases in those reductions over both

the first and second quarter, as you note, about HPI down $6 billion. And as we – if we ultimately reach our target,
we expect the total AE reduction to be approximately $9 billion. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Glenn, I just want to add two things just in looking at that, because Denis was focused on the AE and the
continued journey. The one thing he didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there
were meaningful marks around that. There are some where you'd reduce where it might be a public position. So,
we mark those public positions at market that night, and you sell that position at a discount. So, there could be a
slight loss. There are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to
what you believe it's worth and you sell it and you'll get a gain. But I wouldn't say there's anything material that I'd
call out in the context of that process.
But the important thing about the journey that I'd like to emphasize is we laid out clearly at Investor Day that we
were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these two big businesses. Clearly, at this point
in time, given the lack of investment banking activity, our investment banking business is performing at a lower
level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. We don't believe that's constant.
We believe that that Global Markets & Banking (sic) [Global Banking & Markets] business can deliver mid-teens
return through the cycle, and that obviously makes up more than two-thirds of the firm.
In addition, Marc Nachmann laid out at our Investor Day a very clear path on asset management to grow the top
line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage, and we set a target to
drive the margin which, ex the legacy balance sheet, up to 25%. At that point, that is a mid-teens return business.
And as we continue to narrow the drag, which we're making progress on in the platforms, and I believe we'll
narrow that to zero and move past that, you've got these two businesses that are the firm that will be mid-teens
through the cycle. And so, that's the way I'd think about it. But obviously, you need a better environment than this
environment to see that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate all that. And maybe one just big picture. I think a lot of the banks that – investment banks that have
reporter over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity
returning. And I think in typical Goldman fashion, you all have been, I think, appropriately conservative over the
last couple of quarters. So, maybe I'll just get mark-to-market on what green shoots you may or may not be
seeing. You mentioned your advisory pipeline was up. [ph] Just like kind of (00:21:24) contextualize that, that'd be
great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I'd say, Glenn, the following. It definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt
earlier in the year. And I've talked in the past on this call and other times when I've talked to many of you about
the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes five or six quarters to get that reset. It's not surprising that we're
kind of at six quarters now and you're starting to see more activity. So, there's definitely been a pick-up in equity
capital markets activity. That definitely feels better. There's more M&A dialogue.
I can't tell you exactly what the journey is. But when I go back and I look historically at other periods where the
macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity, they tend to last for a year or so and

then they start to improve. And so, I think we're starting to see that here. It definitely feels better. I think the
inflation data has been better. The client sentiment is better, and now we'll have to watch and see that journey.
But I know this activity level of 10-year lows in investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a
forward basis.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe just a first question, when we think about potential for obviously pick-up in the
back half, David, as you just mentioned, but give us a sense of right-sizing the business, given the slowdown that
we've seen over the last year or so. Are we there head count-wise, infrastructure-wise, where you wanted to be
on the expense base? And as we anchor back to the efficiency target, around 60%, just give us a sense of how
you think we get there and where Goldman is today in terms of just right-sizing the expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think we – I'll make a couple of comments and Denis will probably add on with some more granular
detail. But I think we've made progress. We set out some targets at the beginning of the year. As you heard in
Denis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished and in line of sight for more. You've seen our
non-comp expense, ex these extraordinary items around impairments, have been down for the second quarter in
a row. We've been very focused on that. And there's been real work done there, because there's certainly
inflationary pressure on a bunch of the line items in our non-comp expenses.
I think that with hindsight, I'm very glad that we were early in January, starting to work on the head count sizing.
We took a couple of actions so far this year, and we feel good about where we are. I'd remind everybody, and
we've said this before, that we are resuming our regular performance-based process that we do with
compensation at the end of the year, which we had stopped during the pandemic, and start it again next year. So,
when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review, but we have no other specific plans on the
head count now.
We'll watch the trajectory of revenues and the environment, as we go forward. We'll always make adjustments if
something changes. But as we just said, we think we're operating in extraordinarily low activities of investment
banking. We're not going to erode that franchise. That is the key franchise of the firm. So, this is a moment that
we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover.
We obviously are focused on a bunch of efficiency uplift [ph] in processes and (00:24:58) operations. We have a
big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology, and we feel
good about that. So, we think that, over time – that's not a 2023 or early 2024 thing, but we think over time, that's
something else that will benefit the trajectory. Denis, do you have some specifics to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I mean, just to add for you. So, end of the second quarter, we ended – head count was 44,600. It's down
about 2% on the quarter, about 8% year-to-date. I think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-
year metric of down 5%, because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter. But as David said, we're happy about

taking the action early in the year, positioning the firm appropriately, and also pleased that we've been able to
reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just maybe a quick follow-up. I think if I heard you correctly, you mentioned goal to maybe step up
pace of buybacks in the back half. If you could maybe put some numbers around that, what level of buybacks we
should expect, and how big a deal is The Fed Basel NPR. From what we're hearing, it may take 6, 12 months
before we know what the final rules, when they incorporate industry feedback, look like. So, how big of an
unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, you have pieces of the answer to the question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
... [ph] before my (00:26:25) answer. So, what we would say, obviously, very pleased with the CCAR results. We
have 190 basis points of cushion. We intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to
continue to grow our activities there. We announced our increase in dividend. We remain very committed to
sustainably growing our dividend, and we're going to increase our level of buybacks.
We are mindful of Basel III revisions. But we also recognize that we'll get a rule, there'll be a comment period for
the rule, there'll be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. That
implementation may even have a phase-in period. So, as we think about the way in which we manage capital, we
think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. We obviously will make sure we're
in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early. But in the intervening period, we're going
to continue to manage our capital to grow the firm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders, and we
thought we would indicate that that intention is to step it up from where we are.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
So, David, there's been a fair amount of press speculation covering how your – the consumer business
specifically, even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to a
partnership with Apple and GM. I know press speculation might not be representative of what's actually being
discussed. So, it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business, maybe
how your vision has evolved in recent months, just given some of the challenges facing that business, and maybe
not fitting with your – aligning with your core competencies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, and I'd frame it this way. As I think you know, we made difficult but appropriate
decisions over a year ago, working with our board, to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out [ph] in
the fall (00:28:46) the direction of travel and have been executing on that. And that included the wind-down and
the execution of the Marcus – the wind-down and the execution of the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio, which has
now been completed, and obviously, exploring options for GreenSky, which we've been transparent on and are in
the process of.
We've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. We don't have unilateral
rights with them. They definitely can operate better. We've been working hard to improve the operation of them,
which will reduce the drag, and we're making good progress on that. And we're working with Apple and also with
GM to do that. And so, there's significant focus on reducing that drag. And the drag of those credit card
partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024.
We continue to have a very strong deposit platform. We launched a Apple savings platform, which also was a
successful launch that grew our deposit base. And so, we'll continue to grow deposits, and that's the course that
we're on at the moment.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, that's great color. So, thanks for all of that, David. Maybe just for my follow-up on equity financing specifically.
The contribution in the first half actually implies an incremental $1 billion in fees year-on-year. You've definitely
been highlighting the commitment to grow the financing piece. I just wanted to better understand, one, the
durability of the gains that you saw in the first half. And as we look out over the next few years, how significant of
a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the financing component both across equities as well as
FICC?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, I'm going to start with a high level, just strategic view of what I think we've done and we're focused on doing,
and then Denis will give you a little bit more detail. But one of the things – this has been a strategic priority for us,
because I certainly remember, going back over the last decade, there were times when we did not have the
largest equity business and we were not in the position with our clients in the equity franchise that we're in now.
And there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time, but we've been very
focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress.
And growing the financing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a
real difference. And so, I look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it, very good
about what the team's accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. Now, broadly, that

financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue, but it obviously is affected by risk-on, risk-off and
overall market-level activities. And so, there can be variability in it, but there's a base stability there that's much
more meaningful than intermediation revenues. Denis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that
from a risk and a capital perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, that is the strategic direction of travel. We are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital,
financial capital to grow those activities. Equities financing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenues
this quarter, and that's something that has been growing. Even the combined FICC and equities financing as a
percentage of FICC and equities continue to grow. So, we remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that
space with clients. And we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow
market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. It's paying dividends both across
dividend and intermediation.
And recognizing David's comments with respect to market valuation levels, which drive changes in balances and
changes in behavior, there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of
the client base across the financing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated
portions of the client base. So, we remain committed to growing that activity. It's relatively more durable than
intermediation. But like other line items, it can fluctuate on the forward.

Hey. Just one follow-up to that last question and then a different one. But just on the last question, so you
mentioned durability when you were talking about financing. That was part of what I wanted to understand. Do
you feel like this quarter of financing revenue is a good jump-off point for us to grow from? And if there's any puts,
takes on how you would think – how would you want us to think about that level of durability, that would be
helpful. Thanks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Sure. So, I'll comment both on FICC and equities. In fixed income, we had slightly softer performance period-on-
period. That was driven by a component of FICC financing which is more episodic, which is commodities-based
financing. Those activity levels were a lot higher. And so, I think you see lack of contribution from commodities-
based financing activity that was in prior periods. But I think the forward for other components of our FICC
financing like collateralized lending and repo, I think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to
grow those types of activities. Always cautious about predicting growth off of record performance. We're pleased
with the equities financing performance in the second quarter, and we do intend to grow that from here. But we'll
have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth. But we do think there's
still unaddressed market share, and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And you highlighted capital, obviously, have excess – significant excess. So, there's that flex between buybacks
versus deploy. This is an opportunity to deploy. I guess the follow-up I had to that was, in your comments earlier
on the Basel III endgame, I think you mentioned that you – look, you're in a position to be opportunistic whether or
not you want to meet the requirements early. And I guess that was the question I had on, when you say on time,
of course. But early just meaning within that phase-in period early? And again, I kind of ask the question with the
context of you've got this opportunity in financing. So, how should I think through meeting it early versus leaning
into financing versus other options you might have? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah, Betsy. So, look, I appreciate that. I think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this.
And we're talking about years out. And so, I think Denis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in
period, making sure we were getting there on time. But no, we are focused on deploying. We generate a lot of
capital because the firm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. We are going to return a bunch of
that to shareholders, and there are opportunities, as we're talking about to deploy that in service of [ph] clients
(00:36:06).
Given the work we've done strategically, we now have much greater flexibility, which gives us the option to look
sharply at some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we thought we needed to be
more cautious, and at the same point, we have more capacity, as Denis said, to step up buybacks. You should
view that we're very, very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders, and we'll be very
thoughtful about the adjustment phase-in of whatever comes, when we understand it. But I'd just say there's a lot
of uncertainty. It's a ways out. There's going to be comment periods, and so there's nothing going to be premature
about what we do.

Hi. Look, I think you described here the right-sizing [ph] with investment, equity, debt (00:37:06), CIE, the
consumer and with head count. I guess the specific question is what were any severance charges in the quarter
and where are you on the right-sizing on head count? And the big picture question for David is simply, is this as
bad as it gets? Do you feel comfortable that you've captured everything with – from any severance to [ph] Marcus,
(00:37:38) to GreenSky, the CIEs, [ph] the debt and (00:37:39) equity investments that you're conservative

enough? Are we going to keep seeing 9% ROEs or does this accelerate your journey to that 15% midterm ROE?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Okay. Mike, it's Denis. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to David. So, we called out our severance expense year-to-
date, which is $260 million. The vast majority of that was in the first quarter in connection with much larger levels
of head count reductions then. The reason that we're making an effort to call it out, you will also notice that our
comp ratio, net of provisions, is at 34%. We're just making an effort to provide transparency in terms of what
components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance.
And we think that's important, because with the balance, we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance
ethos, as well as balancing returns for shareholders, but making sure that we have the capacity this year to
protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. So, the severance
disclosures are just designed to help understand the financial impact of the actions we've taken. David will give
you more color, but we've largely done what we set out to do. We're on target for the payroll efficiencies, and
that'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and
expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
And Mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter in putting some things that we strategically
decided to do behind us. With respect to the balance sheet, I think one of the things that's very important to call
out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. We are reducing the
legacy balance sheet. But we could just as well next quarter, if the environment improves, have positive revenues
from that legacy balance sheet too. But if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce.
So, I've been around the firm a long time. This was obviously a tough quarter, but we also had one-off items that
we've put in. We're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to
continue to move forward. I think the environment feels better. If the environment feels better and the environment
turns out to be better, you'll see better performance. But I feel very, very good about the strategic decisions that
we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in Asset & Wealth Management,
and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And can you remind us – so, you're taking this pain, the charges, and you're looking to get to mid-teens ROE in
the medium-term. How do you define medium-term and what should we be looking at along the way? Because to
the extent that this accelerates this transition, it'd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, we're going to make progress, Mike, over the next couple of years. The next two to three years, we're going
to make meaningful progress. But I'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, Banking & Markets,
where we are a leader, and I think given the mix of that business, it's performing well in what's not a perfect
environment for that business. If – that business we really believe will deliver mid-teens through the cycle. The

investment banking returns right now are at a very, very significant low. But we do have a 14% ROE to-date in
Global Banking & Markets.
So, an improved environment should help us. The asset management journey is going to take – and we were very
clear about this in February, it's going to take two to three more years for us to continue to make progress on the
journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift.
And we're working on it. We see a clear line of sight, and we're going to make progress.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You spoke earlier to green shoots that you're seeing in the
banking side. Given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise, curious to drill down and specifically
understand what you're seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market
recover before they can come back in full force. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for that question, Brennan. It's a good question. It's an important thing. I'm glad you're asking us
to highlight it, because I think about it this way and it's very, very important. When you look at our M&A business,
a significant contributor to our M&A business is M&A for sponsors, and that's come to a halt. It's come to a halt.
There are two aspects of it. There's buy-sides and there's sell-sides. The buy-sides obviously also give us
financing and other capital markets activity. The sell-sides sometimes give [ph] staple and (00:42:37) financing
opportunity too, but that stuff's kind of come to a halt. Here's one thing I know about financial sponsors. Number
one, they own bunch of assets. They're all for sale and they all will be sold. This environment has slowed down
the pace of sale. In a better environment, that will accelerate, and I think we're going to see that accelerate as we
look forward from here. This has been a particularly slow environment for that.
Secondly, they have enormous dry powder, okay, and they can't make money unless they deploy. And so, as
soon as you get to a place that values reset and financing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy it.
We're starting to see some of that. You saw this quarter obviously a very, very big transaction around FIS. And
so, you're going, I think, to see more as we move forward. So, this is a very, very important part of the investment
banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown, given the volatility of change in the environment. And I'm not
smart enough to tell you this quarter, next quarter. But it will meaningfully improve, and it's an important
component to investment banking activity. And it's one of the reasons why investment banking activity is running
at kind of – from an activity level kind of 10-year lows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
And the other part of your question, Brendon (sic) [Brennan], speaks to availability and health of financing
markets. I think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions, and we believe we can
distribute risk into the market. There's also a number of [ph] principling (00:44:06) buckets both with our clients
and within our own funds that are capable of deploying financing to support transaction activity in this
environment. That could also be an attractive source of activity for the firm.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for all that color. I appreciate it. And then, for my second, you started the process of selling
GreenSky. We saw the goodwill impairment. What's been the reception to that asset and has that impacted your
expectation for how quickly you could finalize that sale? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. We have feedback. I think
extra color, just to share with you, in terms of how you think about potential on the forward, it's a business we
bought for $1.7 billion. We integrated it into Goldman Sachs. We're seeing it perform well. It's a good business.
We have made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right fit necessarily for Goldman Sachs.
We've written down the goodwill on the consumer platforms segment. There's no more goodwill to be written
down. That business, at this point, has remaining unamortized intangibles of approximately $625 million that we
consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so on the future.
And should we move forward with a transaction with respect to GreenSky, it could happen in a number of different
ways. We could sell the platform. We could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on
balance sheet. And should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held-for-sale, much like the
Marcus loans process. And you'll see the P&L impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the
associated reserve. So, those are the types of things that could occur on the forward, given the strategic activity.
But I don't think there's anything else to say about the GreenSky process given where we are.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Thank you. Good morning. So, in markets, we hit on financing. So, just want to look at intermediation here, and
obviously, results were off quite a bit from a great quarter last year. But based on the results, it also looks like you
did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter. So, just the implication there would be
that June got a lot better for intermediation. So, just want to make sure kind of that read is correct. And then did
June feel like a more normal month relative to the first couple and has that continued? Just trying to think about
the quarter and the cadence there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks, Devin. I'd just say, and you highlighted this appropriately, just pointing back, I mean, one of the
big differences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we were coming out of the period where the
war had started in Russia and there was enormous activity in the commodity space. And we were very, very well-
positioned to serve clients in that space. And so, we – if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we
way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity, and obviously, didn't have that here.
I think to the second part of your comment, yes, June was better. I think June was definitely better. And so, there
was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk-on. And look, we're early in the quarter, but
there's no question there's more of a risk-on sentiment in the month of July than there was earlier in the second

quarter. And you just think about it. We were coming out of March, we were coming out of the banking crisis, and
you think about when we were on this call in early April, we were in a very different place in terms of investor
sentiment overall. So, there has been an improvement through the quarter and I think it's noted appropriately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. That's great. And then, just on transaction banking and the momentum there, it'd be great to just get an
update on some of the kind of the drivers. And really the question is, it's such a huge market, as you guys
identified when you got into the business. It's still a very small driver for Goldman. And so, just trying to think
about the growth there. And are there opportunities for more step-function growth if you add a certain capability or
just how should we think about the opportunity to really – this to become a much bigger business for Goldman?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, appreciate that question. I think you're right. I think we've got an interesting platform. It's been very
constructive in bringing deposits to Goldman Sachs. But one of the things that we said over the last couple of
quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments
activity into the flow, so that it delivers real revenue and real value over time. That's taking some time, and it will
take some time. I think it's [ph] a dispersed (00:48:50) where there are lots of providers for most people. These
are our clients. So, we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged [ph] for (00:48:58) this. They like our
technology. But making changes in payment flows take time.
So, I think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment and building those relationship. I think a
particular opportunity for us is around what I call kind of financial sponsor companies, et cetera, where obviously
given our financial sponsors franchise, we have a very, very good opportunity set over time. But this is going to
take time to execute. And I think it's one of those things where we have a business, it's performing fine, but it's not
making a meaningful contribution. But I think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to figure out how
this could make a more meaningful contribution to the firm with our client base.

Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about private banking and lending, even ex the $100 million gain this
quarter, that continues to be an area of growth. Can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward
and the inputs to kind of continue the level of growth you've seen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall Asset & Wealth Management business which we
think has the combined benefit of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues. There's a
couple components inside of that line item. We've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform, which has
been contributing nicely, and that was the area in which we had our Marcus loans activities, which on the forward,
those will obviously have – will not be contributing on the forward. But the other piece of it, which is an area of
strategic priority for us, is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities.

And we have, as I think David highlighted earlier, the premium ultra-high net worth business that has been
growing nicely, but we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with
those clients and across the wealth space. And so, we have some new leadership across the division in the past
number of quarters and a very, very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those
relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible, and we expect that'll be
a contributor to that line item as well on the forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. And then, just as a follow-up, in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook, and as you think about line
of sight, which I think you used to give us some numbers, and given capital markets maybe opening up and a little
bit more receptive to exits, anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the short-term that you're
planning on or have, as I said, line of sight on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Appreciate that question. So, obviously, we took you to current on historical principal investments at $23.8
billion. You know that there is a year-end 2024 target of below $15 billion. We said we are well on pace towards
that target. I would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. We have a large
number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. They're all in various stages of
completeness from exclusivity to on offer to being marketed to being prepared. We moved a large number of
positions year-to-date, and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. So, I would offer that up as it's
an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. So, the SCB obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple
of years now. We are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that.
And specifically with the sale of the Marcus loans and potentially sale of GreenSky loans, and again, according to
the media, potentially exit of the credit card, I guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the
SCB or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on
the annual DFAST/CCAR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, look, you're familiar with the process as we are. There's various level of transparency that you get
through the process. Obviously, there was contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the
test. But the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our SCB towards
the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. We think that
has a very, very meaningful impact for us.
And the thing I would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this SCB of 5.5%
due to be implemented in October, that's based on the snapshot of activity that the Fed took last year, which
means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. And
assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year, which I don't know, but if it is, we will continue to

see benefit from our reduction of these on-balance sheet investments. So, the reason why we remain so focused
on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really
believe that that's a very, very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until

Okay. So, focused much more on the legacy on-balance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios.
All right, that's helpful.

David, in your opening comments, you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a mid-teens
ROE through the cycle. We all know the business has been depressed, as you pointed out in your comments.
Can you share with us, if you go – we have – the public has access to the Dealogic data. Your data is probably
better than that. But if you look at the Dealogic [ph] data for you (00:55:26) in 2021 and 2022, obviously, the
global investment banking revenues were unusually strong. What would you think is a normal level for global
investment banking revenues that you need to get to that mid-teens ROE that you're targeting?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, again, I'd highlight that Global Banking & Markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% ROE for the
first six months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. We don't disclose the
separate ROE for investment banking, but I'd just highlight to you it's running way, way below what it's run on
average over the course of the last 5 and the last 10 years. We do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in
order to see a material uplift in that investment banking ROE, which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle
uplift of our Global Banking & Markets franchise.
I'm sure, in my lifetime, maybe not in my career, I'll see another year like 2021. But 2021 falls into that category of
years that come along once in a decade. I wouldn't call that normal either. But I would say that this is not normal,
and normal lies somewhere in between – or average. I hate the word normal. Average lies somewhere in
between.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
The only thing I would add, which I'm sure is [ph] intuitive to you (00:56:50), Gerard, some of the activities that are
not contributing as substantially right now are very capital-efficient activities. And so, looking at Dealogic levels of
activity or revenues are one metric. But some of them are very, very beneficial to our overall results, and they also
have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. So, in environments of more active levels of
investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the firm that's not necessarily captured simply
from the delta explained in that investment banking line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. One other thing, Gerard, I'd just add. If you go back – it's an interesting thing to do. If you go back and you
look at investment banking revenues from people who report them over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000
and look at investment banking revenues, there's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues
have dropped meaningfully because of that. You can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20
to 25 years. You can see that from 2001 to 2002. You can see that from 2007 to 2008. You can see that from
2010 to 2011. And obviously, you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and 2023.
What's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth
and the up-shoot, because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy, et cetera. I don't think it's going to
be different this time. I think this is a cycle. We haven't seen a cycle in a while, and the other side of the cycle will
continue to look attractive. The services and advising, the need for mergers and consolidation even though there
could be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity, IPOs, equity financing, debt financing, that's
a fundamental part of our economy. It's not going away. It's been depressed for the last four to six quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Denis, a technical question for you on GreenSky. You mentioned that you still
have intangibles, and you are going to – or you still have a determination to make whether GreenSky should
move into held-for-sale. Two-part question. What will trigger that to move it into held-for-sale? And then, should
you do that and if there is an intangible impairment, do you have to take that impairment at that time when you
move it into held-for-sale or you can wait for a later date?

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, thank you. The decision as to whether and when we move it to held-for-sale is when we make a decision
affirmatively that we are selling the business and/or selling the loan portfolio, and we will – when we make that
decision, we will designate it as such, and you will see the P&L consequences of that designation at that point in
time. We evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment, and in the next quarter, we will also analyze
the intangibles for impairment.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Just on Platform Solutions profitability, appreciate you getting to an efficiency ratio already
below 100%. But the other drag on profits is credit. I think you guys noted that in consumer platforms, you had a
5.8% net charge-off ratio. I would imagine point-of-sale is lower than card. So, that would imply cards is well north
of 6% in terms of the net charge-off ratio. How do we – is that right and how do we think about the credit quality in
that book and where you see it kind of normalizing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, a couple things. On the one hand, the net charge-off in consumer at 5.8% for the quarter, given the
nature of our portfolio, its maturity, the overall operating environment, we do expect that that will continue to tick
up over the next couple of quarters. But you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well,
and that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected.
We had put together provisions on a conservative basis. And now, as we have more and more data coming
through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage
ratio. So, I'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe just a follow-up question on wealth management. We haven't really talked about it in a while, but
whether it's with Ayco and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultra-high net worth space. Can you talk
to the progress you've made there and what – kind of where you're seeing investments and growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Ayco, within the overall platform, Ayco is something we continue to grow, we continue to be focused on. It's
extremely well-received, in particular by a number of our C-suite clients. It's part of our approach to having a more
integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. We do see opportunities to continue to
expand our offering. But we also see opportunities to expand within the ultra-high net worth space both in the
United States and abroad. And we have a very, very long track record of delivering, and we believe we are
actually, despite the franchise, underpenetrated and continue to grow that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. Please continue with any closing remarks.
