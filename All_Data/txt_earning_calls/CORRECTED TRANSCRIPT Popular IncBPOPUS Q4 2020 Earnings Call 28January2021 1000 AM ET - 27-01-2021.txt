high note with $176 million in earnings during the fourth quarter. This was one of our best quarters in our history.
These results reflect the ongoing rebound in economic activity experienced during the second-half of the year and
the unprecedented level of federal stimulus. Our strong results also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and
prudent risk management.
Please turn to slide 3 for an update on the current business environment in Puerto Rico. In the fourth quarter,
business trends and customer activity continued to improve, building upon the momentum seen in the third
quarter as many of the pandemic-related restrictions were gradually loosened. Employment trends, which
deteriorated rapidly in April, have improved but are still down significantly compared to last year.
Total nonfarm employment has increased by 6% since April when employment bottomed out but remained 8%
below the December 2019 level. In 2020, new auto sales were 11% lower than the previous year, mainly a result
of the restrictions on auto sales and financing from March through May. However, demand has rebounded sharply
since May and remains robust. Fourth quarter sales of almost 36,000 units marked the highest recorded quarterly
level going back to at least 2013.
Cement sales increased by 16% in the fourth quarter as compared to the year-ago period. Tourism and the
hospitality sector are improving slowly but continue to lag other areas of the local economy. While airport traffic
has been gradually increasing, arrivals during the month of December were still 45% lower than the previous
year.
Within Popular's clientele, debit and credit card sales in dollars increased by 18% compared to the last year's
fourth quarter. For the full-year, sales increased by 10%. Auto loan and lease originations at BPPR increased by
11%, compared to the year-ago quarter and were only down 5% for the full-year notwithstanding the pandemic-
related disruptions. Similarly, we saw continued strength in the dollar value of mortgage durations at BPPR which
were up 20% in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and increased by 32% in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Please turn to slide 4 for an update on PPP and other operational matters. Most of our branches are now fully
operational and we continue to take measures to ensure the safety of our employees and customers. We are also
focused on supporting our customers in this uncertain environment. During the initial phase of the pandemic, we
offered payment relief to our retail and commercial customers and are working with those clients who still need
assistance. We continue to offer alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our employee base. We
are committed to ensure a safe transition back to on-premise activities which we currently plan to be no earlier
than April. We have been working with local authorities to promote and facilitate COVID-19 vaccination efforts and
we are actively encouraging our employee base to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible to do so.
With respect to the PPP program, $544 million of the loans originated were under $150,000 and are eligible for
expedited forgiveness under the SBA's simplified process. We have deployed an online platform for customers to
request loan forgiveness and have submitted approximately $500 million in forgiveness request to the SBA.
Leveraging this online platform, we began accepting applications for the second phase of the PPP program last
week. To-date, we have received more than 3,200 applications, totaling approximately $234 million.
On the digital front, we continue to have more than 1 million monthly active users on our Mi Banco platform in
Puerto Rico. We captured 71% of deposits in the fourth quarter through digital channels. For the full-year, 67% of
deposits in PPP were captured digitally compared to 52% in 2019. Finally, our customer base in Puerto Rico
continues to grow, increasing by 6,000 in the fourth quarter to reach more than 1.9 million unique customers.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Please turn to slide 5, our annual net income of $507 million reflects the decrease of approximately 24% from our
2019 annual record net income of $671 million. The decrease was largely driven by higher provision expense,
lower fees, and lower net interest income related to the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. 2020
results benefited from the strong deposit growth and a higher level of earning assets in both Puerto Rico and the
US, however both of our branch have lower net interest margins during the year. Credit quality remained stable
throughout 2020. We are pleased with how our portfolios have performed in this difficult period.
Our capital levels are strong with year-end Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity ratios at 16.3%. Our tangible
book value ended 2020 at $63.07, a 14% increase year-over-year. In Puerto Rico, we grew those by 7%,
increased our deposits by 35% and our net interest margin was 3.4%. In our US operation, we grew those by 8%,
deposits by 2%, and our net interest margin was 3.21%.
Please turn to slide 6, our quarterly net income of $176 million was $8 million higher than the third quarter and $9
million than the same quarter last year. These results were driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher
provision and operating expenses including pre-tax expenses of $23 million related to our New York branch
realignment program. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in our investment portfolio
and lower deposit costs. Credit quality trends were solid in the quarter. All-in-all, we are very pleased with our
fourth quarter results. And with that, I will now turn it over to Carlos.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio and good morning. Before we turn to fourth quarter results, I will expand on Popular's 2020
full-year performance. Our net interest income decreased by 2% year-over-year to $1.86 billion, as lowered net
interest margins were only partially offset by growth in earning assets. 2020 provision expense increased by 76%
to $293 million, primarily driven by the impact of the pandemic. Non-interest income decreased by 10% year-over-
year with most segments lowered in 2021, again mostly pandemic-related.
Operating expenses decreased by 1% for the year to $1.46 billion. Lower personnel costs and business
promotion expenses were the primary drivers. Our capital position is robust. We ended the year with a tangible
book value increasing by nearly $8 per share to $63.07. This improvement was achieved even after the
repurchase of our $100 million common stock, the increase in our common stock dividend, and the redemption of
$28 million preferred stock. Common equity Tier 1 ratio dropped by 149 basis points year-over-year to 16.3%.
Please turn to slide 7, additional information is provided in the Appendix of the slide deck. Today's earnings press
release details variances from the third quarter. Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $472 million, an
increase of $11 million from Q3. Non-interest income increased by $16 million to $145 million in Q4. More
specifically, we generated $2.3 million higher deposit service fees, $1.3 million higher other service fees, and
$19.3 million in additional mortgage banking income, mainly due to the negative impact in Q3 of the bulk agency
mortgage loan repurchase. These items were partially offset by $3.7 million lower gains on sale securities and
$4.2 million lower earnings from portfolio investments held under the equity method. To a large extent, our non-
interest income has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. We expect it to continue tracking historical levels.
Provision expense for the quarter was $21.2 million, which is $2 million higher than in Q3 but it includes a
reclassification of $10 million for unfunded loan commitments to the provision for credit losses. This is only a
change in geography in our income statement. Lidio will expand later.
Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter, $14.9 million higher than in Q3. This includes $23.2
million in the previously disclosed expenses related to Popular Bank's branch closure actions. Excluding the

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
branch closure related cost and the expense reclassification, the net increase in expenses will have been $1.7
million, primarily driven by a $6.3 million increase in personnel cost, composed of a $2.1 million severance
expense related to Popular Bank's branch network realignment, higher 401(k) match due to an additional bi-
weekly payroll and higher incentive compensation.
Net occupancy expense was $16.9 million higher due to a $19 million in cost related to the termination of leases
associated with Popular Bank's branch realignment. Professional fees increased by $7.6 million, mainly due to
higher advisory expenses and higher processing and technology service cost. Finally, business promotion
expenses increased by $1.8 million, due to higher seasonal advertising expenses.
For the full-year, our average quarterly expenses were approximately $365 million. This is $18 million lower than
the initial expectation of $383 million in average quarterly expenses we disclosed during our webcast in January
of 2020. In response to the pandemic, we implemented various cost savings initiatives. We have targeted $55
million in savings during the year. However, we ultimately were able to reduce 2020 planned expenses by $75
million. These savings were focused on compensation, benefits and business promotion expenses. Most of the
adjustments were in response to the pandemic, and as such, many of those savings will revert as the effect of the
pandemic wanes.
For 2021, we expect average quarterly expenses to be between $375 million and $380 million. While this is higher
than the quarterly average we achieved in 2020, it is still below our original expense guidance for last year. This
increase from 2020 is mostly driven by higher expenses in the following three categories: Personnel, as we invest
in training, compensation, and related benefits, many of the savings in 2020 were cost to compensation and
incentive pay. Technology, as we continue to modernize our digital capabilities, cure obsolescence and address
regulatory [indiscernible] (00:13:50) and compliance needs. Some of these investments were delayed in 2020;
finally business promotion especially expenses related to client reward programs.
Some of the growth in this category results from our revamped rewards for credit cards and from our digital
offerings. [ph] All the higher (00:14:12) technology and reward expense are related to expectations of higher
levels of client activity in 2021. We will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses. Our effective tax
rate for the quarter was 20%. For 2021, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.
Please turn to slide 8, net interest income for the quarter was $471.6 million, an increase of $10.6 million from Q3.
The primary drivers of this increase were increased earning asset balances driven by higher levels of deposits in
Puerto Rico, the replacement [indiscernible] (00:14:55) in the investment portfolio, and lower deposit cost
primarily at Popular Bank.
Deposits grew by $844 million in the quarter. This increase was mostly in BPPR. NIM decreased 2 basis points to
3.04% in Q4. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin was 3.35%, also a decrease of 2 basis points.
The reduction in the margin reflects an increase in the size of the investment portfolio at lower loan yields,
partially offset by a decrease in deposit cost. The total loan yield decreased by 16 basis points in Q4. The bulk
mortgage loan repurchase at the end of Q3 was the main driver of this decrease as these assets yield
approximately 3.5%. For 2021, we expect margin to be stable. Asset mix, round two PPP originations, and the
speed at which PPP loans are forgiven will drive the ultimate result.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, Puerto Rico total deposits were roughly $15 billion, about $500 million higher
than in Q3. We continue to expect total deposit balances to come down over time. However, in the near-term,
additional federal stimulus and tax revenues in the first-half of the year would likely increase the deposit balances.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Our average loan balances increased by $757 million in the quarter. We expect loan losses will be impacted by
PPP forgiveness as well as limited demand fueled by unprecedented levels of client liquidity, which may expand
further with additional federal transfers. Round two of the PPP program will help loan balances but we still do not
expect overall loan growth to materialize in the first-half of 2021.
Please turn to slide 9, our overall capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect
towards capitalized regulatory requirements. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q4 was 16.3%, up 34 basis
points from Q3. Tangible book value increased by $1.38 per share to $63.07. This increase was driven by our
quarterly net income, offset somewhat by dividend payment. Our return on tangible equity was 14.5% in the fourth
quarter and 10.8% for 2020. We will continue to pursue our target of maintaining and improving our double-digit
return on tangible equity. As discussed last quarter, we expect to be able to make capital-related announcements
in April.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Executive Vice President-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Thank you Carlos and good morning. Overall, our credit performance remained stable during the fourth quarter,
aided by payment deferrals, government stimulus, and the resumption of collection efforts. Given the uncertainty
caused by the pandemic and the extent of the economic disruption, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID
on our entire loan portfolio.
Turning to slide number 10, we have provided relief to our customer through loan modifications consisting of
deferrals, forbearance, or extensions. We granted assistance to approximately 132,000 customer accounts,
representing $8.3 billion of loans or 28% of the total loan balance. 97% of customers have exited relief and
approximately 94% of these accounts remain current. We are attentive to borrower performance across our
portfolios, but in particular to the post-moratorium mortgage loss mitigation activity and certain sensitive
commercial segments.
Please turn to slide number 11, which highlights these commercial segments. We think the CRE non-retail
segment, the exposure in Puerto Rico is mainly comprised of office space while the exposure in the US is mainly
multifamily. The average original loan-to-value in Puerto Rico is 77% while in the US is 75%. Office space and
multifamily occupancy and collection have remained stable through the pandemic. To-date, there have been
moderate numbers of downgrades in this segment. Of the customers that have exited relief, 98% of accounts
remain current.
In the health care facilities segment, our Puerto Rico exposure is mainly to hospitals while our US exposure is to
skilled nursing facilities. For both regions, federal and local assistance have supported the industry operation. To-
date, there have been a moderate number of deferrals and downgrades in this portfolio.
Within non-essential retail, the shelter-in-place orders curtailed activity of this segment. Notwithstanding, our
customer base has experienced an increase in activity after the lockdown orders were lifted. To-date, there have
been a moderate number of deferrals and downgrades in this portfolio. Of the customers that have exited
deferrals, 99% of accounts are current. The average original loan-to-value for this segment is 69%. In general,
based on discussions with our major borrowers, occupancy and collection have remained stable with signs of
improvement during the fourth quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Regarding the construction segment, most of our exposure is in the US and principally in the New York metro
region. The majority of our projects are in late stages of completion, have low loan-to-cost, an average original
loan-to-value of 64%, and nominal exposure to higher-end residential. To-date, there have been a limited number
of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio.
The pandemic has impacted the hospitality industry with unprecedented challenges. The strategies to flatten the
curve such as lockdowns, social distancing, stay-at-home orders, travel and mobility restrictions have significantly
decreased the demand for these businesses. To address the risk to our loan portfolio, we continued to work with
our borrowers to give them time to recover and added a qualitative reserve during the quarter. Our hotel exposure
is mostly in Puerto Rico. At the end of the quarter, our total exposure stood at [ph] $370 million (00:21:52), with an
average original yield loan-to-value of 69%. This segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to limited
business and leisure travel. Most of the deferrals expired in the third and fourth quarter. But given the challenges
of the industry, we foresee additional extension to support our borrowers. To-date, there have been a significant
number of downgrades and deferrals.
Restaurant balances were $338 million at quarter-end. This segment has experienced stress, driven by the
restriction placed on indoor dining. Despite this restriction, the majority of our restaurant borrowers, particularly
quick-service or fast food have continued to operate through delivery and carry-out with volume improvements
during the fourth quarter. Of the customers that have exited deferrals, 99% of accounts are current. To-date, this
segment has had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades, mostly within the [indiscernible] (00:22:57)
category. To finalize, let me highlight that we do not have material current exposure to energy, airlines, which are
[ph] national credits (00:23:06).
Please turn to slide number 12 to discuss credit metrics. Non-performing assets decreased by $15 million to $824
million this quarter, mainly driven by an order decrease of $70 million, offset in part by an NPL increase of $3
million. The order decrease was driven by sales and the suspension of foreclosure activity. The rising NPLs was
driven by an increase of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher mortgage NPLs of $44 million, offset in part by a
decrease of $38 million in commercial NPLs. The increase in mortgage NPLs was mainly due to a delinquency
progression after the expiration of the payment moratorium. We are not overly concerned with this due to three
factors: First, NPLs are comparable to levels prior to the pandemic without the [indiscernible] (00:24:09) outflows
caused by foreclosure. Second, early delinquency are at the lowest levels in the last 10 years. And, finally, the
trend in Popular run rates for early delinquency buckets is encouraging.
Thus, everything being equal, we do not believe that the fourth quarter increasing NPL inflows is a start of a trend
but rather the effect of the expiration of deferrals. The commercial NPLs decrease was mostly related to
impairment charge-off from previously reserve collateral-dependent loans. In the US, NPLs decreased by $3
million due to a previously reserve construction loan that was partially charged off during the quarter. At the end of
the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 2.5%, flat versus the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 13 to discuss NPL inflows, compared to the third quarter, NPL inflows excluding
consumer loans increased by $2 million, driven by an increase of $19 million in Puerto Rico mainly due to
mortgage delinquency progression and the expiration of the moratorium period. In the US, NPL inflows decreased
by $17 million as the prior quarter included the impact of our $11 million relationship that matured and reached 90
days following the renewal process.
Turning to slide number 14, net charge-off amounted to $42 million or annualized 58 basis points of average
loans held-in-portfolio compared to $17 million or 24 basis points in the previous quarter. In Puerto Rico, net
charge-offs increased by $27 million primarily driven by higher commercial net charge-offs of $19 million, mostly

related to previously reserved commercial loans. In the US, net charge-offs decreased by $2 million, primarily
related to recoveries in the commercial portfolio.
The corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by $30 million to $896 million, driven mainly by charge-offs
on the previously mentioned commercial loans and an improved economic outlook, offset in part by an increasing
qualitative reserve as discussed further in the following slide. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans
held-in-portfolio decreased slightly to 3.05% from 3.15% in the third quarter. Excluding Payment Protection
Program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans, this ratio increases by 40 basis points to 3.45% but the ratio of
allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 122% compared to 126% in the prior quarter. The
provision for credit losses increased to $21 million. During the quarter, we reclassified $10 million of the expense
for unfunded loan commitments from other operating expenses to the provision for credit losses. Excluding this
effect, the provision for credit losses on the loan portfolio decreased by $9 million mostly due to improvements in
the macroeconomic scenarios.
Please turn to slide 15 to discuss details on the drivers of the variance and allowance for credit losses. At the end
of fourth quarter, the allowance for credit losses decreased by $30 million compared to the third quarter.
Variances were driven by changes in economic outlook, qualitative reserves, and portfolio of credit quality. As
discussed in the last webcast, we enhanced our ACL framework by introducing probability weights of different
scenarios for estimation process. We combined Moody's analytics S1, Baseline and S3 scenarios. Among the
three scenarios, the Baseline is assigned the highest probability followed by a more pessimistic S3 scenarios
given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk.
The current Baseline scenario shows improvements in both 2021 GDP growth and unemployment rates when
compared to the previous estimates. The change in macroeconomic scenarios caused the ACL to decrease by
$84 million. During the quarter, we added $68 million in qualitative reserve to address specific risks, including the
exposure to the hospitality industry and the potential risk to the macroeconomic conditions in the Puerto Rico
market. Portfolio changes, driven mainly by credit quality and volume mix caused the ACL to increase by $28
million.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited stable credit quality metrics during the fourth quarter aided by payment
deferrals, government stimulus, and the resumption of collection efforts. However, as the effects of the pandemic
continue to evolve and remain fluid, the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain. The improvements over
the last few years in the risk profile of our loan portfolio positions Popular to successfully operate under
challenging environments. Management will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to
pandemic-related risk, changes in economic outlook, and how delinquencies and net charge-offs evolve over the
next few quarters.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. 2020 was certainly a challenging year. It began with devastating
earthquakes in southwestern Puerto Rico which was shortly followed by the unprecedented impacts of the
pandemic including the substantial lockdown of the local economy. I am grateful to our employees for their
commitment to serve our customers and their creativity and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
Whether on the frontline or adjusting quickly to working from home, we are blessed to be part of a team of
talented and dedicated colleagues who have met these challenges with courage and [ph] resiliency (00:30:14).

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
We continue to grow our customer base while we remain focused on supporting our communities. I am extremely
proud of what we have been able to accomplish over the past year. We recorded more than $500 million in net
income and ended the year on a high note, generating one of the best quarters of net income in our history.
In 2020, we were also able to complete our capital plan as intended. We executed a $500 million share
repurchase program, increased our quarterly dividend and redeemed $28 million in preferred stock. While there is
still much uncertainly especially for the first-half of the year, I am optimistic that the vaccination process that is
underway will allow an eventual return to the normalcy we so desire. We begin 2021 on a solid footing and
excited about our prospects for the year.

So, first off, I was just hoping for maybe some more high-level thoughts on the Puerto Rican economy. You gave
some good numbers in the slide deck but sometimes the numbers don't tell us everything. So, for example, I know
we've seen some increase in flows of federal money to the island recently to help rebuild the grid. I was
wondering if you could comment on whether the hiring has started for those projects yet, and then also maybe
things like wage inflation and home prices on the island, maybe some more anecdotal data.

Ignacio Alvarez A

Yeah. You used the word flow, I think. I mean, we're generally optimistic that FEMA finally reached the agreement
with the Electric Power Authority for about $10 billion restoration program and with the Aqueduct & Sewer for $4.5

billion. That money really, to my knowledge, hasn't begun to flow. So that's yet to come. It's important to agree
upon that they're working on implementing that.
What we have seen obviously the $600 payment has come in, as it is in the States. That's been coming in the last
– it began last week and it's continued this week. So we still have a lot of the CDBG funds that are yet to be
spent. They're going out slowly but we are very much more positive. It looks like the new administration
recognizes that there's been a problem getting these funds out, is going to be working closely with the local
authorities to get it out faster. So I think we're going to see that accelerate during the year but we really haven't
seen it yet, so more to come. I think the economy; like in the States we had a big pickup in the third quarter, the
fourth quarter was better than before but not quite the acceleration we had in the third quarter. I do see home
purchases are increasing. I saw a report, I don't know who put it out, so I don't know what [indiscernible]
(00:33:36) home purchases in Puerto Rico went up – home prices in Puerto Rico went up by 7%. So, generally I
think we're optimistic that these flow of funds will have a big impact.
We really haven't seen that great other than the direct stimulus that goes to individuals. It's starting to go out
slowly. We have a new administration, both at the level of the central government and many of the municipalities
changed mayors. I say that because [indiscernible] (00:34:06), the mayors have a big role in that and including
the mayor of San Juan. So, I think that that's probably the number one priority. If it isn't, it should be. But I think
they've all said it is to take advantage of that money. What else can I add? That's – again, the money really hasn't
begun to flow that much, so we're hoping that will now begin in the first part of the year.

When you look at the unemployment or I guess the employment numbers maybe sort of remain and obviously
we're coming out of a pandemic but they remain kind of stubbornly below 1 million jobs, do you think that that
money flowing is going to be the ticket to getting the employment numbers above $1 million in a more sustainable
basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Above – you mean above 1 million person? Yeah, definitely...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah. 1 million jobs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Obviously, there's a couple of sectors that have been seriously impacted that are high employment sectors. The
tourism and restaurants sector, although they don't make up a huge amount of our GDP, they do have a
proportion, larger impact on employment. That sector has been impacted. I think when the economy picks up and
this won't be so much – I mean obviously if the economy picks up, business travel picks up but I think Puerto Rico
will be well-positioned in the leisure market because you're starting to see increasing restrictions on international
travel and I think some people will think twice about going to a foreign country for a while if they're not sure they
can get back to the United States. The other area that always has a big impact on employment is construction.
And again if once you start building the infrastructure that's out there, I think that will have an impact on
employment.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
There are things that worry people in our industry. It's become generally hard for some people to gain – hire
employees. I've heard people from supermarkets and people that are paying near the minimum wage are having
a hard time because in Puerto Rico the federal supplement for unemployment is $400 a week. So if you take a
$40 hour a week, that's $10 an hour. So you're competing against that unemployment. So if you're currently
unemployed, you don't have a big incentive to go out and get a job that pays less than $10 an hour.
So I do think we're going to have a big pickup in the demand side for labor. It will be interesting to see how we can
meet that supply, especially concerning construction industry, whether they'll be able to get all the employees they
need.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's great color. Thank you for that. And then as I think about the reserve and I think about this qualitative
portion that was increased in the fourth quarter, what kinds of things are you looking for that qualitative portion to
kind of reverse? Is it a full opening of the economy or are there other things that you're paying attention to?
And then just over time conceptually, should the reserve head back towards that CECL Day 1 reserve level or is
there enough change that that number is kind of moot at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
I will say that, in general terms, the way to think about qualitative reserve is as there is more clarity as to the [ph]
past four (00:37:35). I think that will allow us, give us more confidence that the need for it has lessened. So that
would be my first take. So, as vaccination continues to evolve, we see a – open up of the economies, I think those
will be indication for, in my view, that qualitative reserves might be let go.
In terms of how to think of the reserve versus Day 1 CECL, I think – I mean there has been significant changes in
portfolio composition. I mean I think that is a starting point, but I wouldn't say that that necessarily we will revert to
that. That would be my answer.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks very much for the question. Going to slide 15 and maybe following-up on that last question, I just
wanted to clarify some of these figures because it looks like some of the improvement in the Puerto Rican macro
is pretty material even in your Baseline. In other words, the Baselines are improving from Q3 to Q4 if I'm reading

this correctly. In addition you've got GDP growth significant in itself; 2.5% next year, 3.4% the year after. And in
employment, it looks like unemployment has dropped in your Baseline 300 basis points from the third to the fourth
quarter and can you comment on those figures?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
I will say some of it has to do with some of the – let's go first on employment. A part of the change in the
unemployment also relates to the difficulty of estimating the unemployment rate when you have significant crisis
or significant disruption to the ability of the bureau to do the unemployment survey. As you know, the
unemployment rate is based on a house-to-house survey that in areas of – when you have disruption, it gets
difficult to implement.
So we – for a very long time, Moody's and economists didn't have the benefit of the March and April numbers,
and many people thought that those numbers significantly higher than they came out to be. That's why you see a
significant shift in terms of the forecast for unemployment particularly in Puerto Rico between the third and fourth
quarter Baseline numbers that we used.
The rest, I agree. I mean there is – at Moody's in particular, they are very high on floor funds for Puerto Rico.
Particularly, I mean the Biden administration has a very aggressive plan for Puerto Rico. Now that they control
both the House and the Senate, they think that a lot of that is going to come to fruition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And shifting to NII and the margin, I heard you on – margins stable; I'm assuming that's
from the fourth quarter. Loan growth, it doesn't sound like we should expect much especially in the first-half. I
guess that points to securities balances, how are you feeling about taking up those levels here given the rate
backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. We redeployed about $3 billion of cash in the third quarter into securities, long-term securities, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. We continue to – as we get more clarity, we continue to consider that; doing more of that. [indiscernible]
(00:41:42) we'll probably do some more of that in 2021.
I'm not dying to extend in the securities portfolio when what we're getting is like 110 basis points, frankly but it's
100 basis points better than 10 basis points, right? So, yeah. We will continue to consider that. As I mentioned in
my prepared remarks, we do expect the balances from the government to actually go up especially in the first-half
of the year. A combination of [indiscernible] (00:42:16) transfers and tax revenues coming in, and then probably
going out in second-half of the year.

So we'll probably have more cash to invest, although some of the cash may be shorter-term. I mean some of the
things that we have in the radar that we're keeping our attention on, for example, in the government balances is
there is a lot of noise, let me say, in the last couple of weeks that there seems to be progress in the process of
restructuring the public debt.
If in fact that happens and there's an agreement to be implemented sometime later this year, I do not know where
that will ultimately be. But the last agreement that was discussed publicly contained a one-time down payment
from the government of Puerto Rico to bondholders of about $6 billion.
So there's instances here where significant amounts of the balances [ph] that depositors make (00:43:21) may
move out so we'll have to keep that in mind. The new governor in Puerto Rico has expressed an interest to – on
their side of the equation to try to move the funds faster as well so there may be additional outflows in normal
course of business from the government of Puerto Rico. So we'll keep looking at all those things. But to
summarize, yes, we will continue to consider extending somewhat in the investment portfolio although we're not
dying to buy assets at 1% yield.

Ignacio, thanks for the color on the economy down in Puerto Rico and I was just wondering if maybe you could
give a couple of specific examples where the federal aid that came down on the island and the $10 billion that
was approved previously where BPOP has been able to service some clients and maybe take advantage of that
money that came down there? It's – just how...

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Well again, the $10 billion in PREPA, very little of it has been spent. I mean they authorized that but I – we
have not seen that money for example in our accounts with PREPA haven't changed dramatically neither with the
[indiscernible] (00:44:56). PREPA has been going through a program of improving their infrastructure and
therefore some of our contractor clients have gotten those contracts. And the CDBG mining we have extended
lines of credit for several of our contracted clients who need to advance the funds before they get reimbursed on
CDBG.
So again I want to emphasize that while we're all very excited about the prospects of the money being released,
to-date the release of those hurricane relief funds have been rather limited, so the expectation is it's an upside
coming. We haven't really seen that money flow yet. There's a lot of talk that they – and there's I think a greater
disposition on the new administration to get those monies released.
What we've seen more is the impact on the consumer side where you see the direct relief. That's very visible in
our deposit balances going up. The PPP loans obviously that – you see our deposits commercial balances going
up also. That money for hurricane relief has really – again it's frustrating for all of us but I'm determined
[indiscernible] (00:46:10). So I look at the bright side which is that's money yet to be pumped into the economy.
And we have made progress. As much as we criticize it, these were complicated processes. And for example the
amount that's been given to – awarded to PREPA is I think a record amount that FEMA has ever given to any
entity. So these are big dollars but again, I want to make everyone [indiscernible] (00:46:37) you're not really
seeing that money spent yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And Carlos thanks for the guidance. In the past on the loan growth guidance, you've kind of
split it up between what you expected in Puerto Rico and what you expected on the mainland. And I was
wondering if you could kind of do that again for 2021 on what the outlook is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the – on both sides, I think the outlook is a little bit clouded by $1.4 billion of PPP loans going
away, Glen. So, that's what drives the whole thing. So if we successfully keep loan balances flat, means that we
actually – [indiscernible] (00:47:21) $1.4 billion more than matured this year.
Ignacio mentioned the round two of PPP. We expect that to help but we also do not expect that to be anywhere
close to the magnitude of the original PPP. So, if anything, I think the commentary we have given before will
continue to hold true Glen which is that we're more confident that continued growth in the US bank and in Puerto
Rico probably more stability.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No surprise. You guys are the lucky dogs. Ignacio, maybe you can share with us, obviously there's been a change
in this administration that we're all are obviously aware of. And the administration, in President Obama's
administration, he was opening up relationships with Cuba; and then under the Trump administration, it went in
the other direction.
Assuming this administration opens – reopens those relationships with Cuba, can you share with us some
opportunities that may arise for Popular if you're permitted to do banking down in Cuba?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Cuba is always a difficult topic. I think that there is a great probability that Biden will revert some of the additional
restrictions that President Trump put in. It may take him a while to do so through procedural hoops.
When Obama opened up, we were very interested in Cuba. I think – I don't know if you noticed but we were one
of only two US banks that issued credit cards that could be used in Cuba. And it took us a while to get to that.

However I really don't expect Cuba to have a big impact on short-term. Really it's a – people always think, from
our perspective, from the US, I mean I don't think you're going to see a meaningful change economically in Cuba
unless the government there takes a radically different approach to the economy. We haven't seen signs that
that's going to happen. So I don't expect anything dramatic to happen.
I think Biden has bigger issues. So, although I think he will revert some of those things, I don't think you'll see the
level of enthusiasm that you saw when President Obama was in power and it was like the beginning of a new era.
I'm not that optimistic, so really I don't see that much opportunity for us frankly. Again, if it does begin to open,
we'll explore like we did last time. We invested in time and money to get that credit card operating.
It wasn't – by the way, very little use on it, so it wasn't a moneymaker. So again I don't think it's going to be a
mover for us in the near future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. Carlos, you answered one of my questions with the public deposits, on what could draw them
down and you mentioned the repayment of some of the debt. What would you guys estimate is a normal level of
those public deposits once we get to normalcy, whenever that is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That's a really good question and we talk about it a lot. When you think about that question, your normal
banker reaction will be, oh, well, let's go back in history and look what the balances looked like before this stuff
happened, and that must be the right number, right?
Unfortunately, when we did that, that number doesn't work because a lot of the accounts that we have from the
government now, we didn't have historically because they used to [ph] stay at (00:51:35) GDB. And when GDB
went bankrupt then a lot of those accounts moved to us. So we don't have the historical flows of those accounts.
So I realize I'm that giving you a very big range but before GDB disappeared we had [indiscernible] (00:51:55)
billions of dollars of government deposits if you add everything up, but they were nowhere close to $15 billion. I
would assume when things normalize, that it's probably going to be a number somewhere between $5 billion and
$10 billion, but I can't get any smarter than that big range to be frank with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then just finally, I know you can't give us the actual dollar amount of your capital action
plans that you plan to announce, I think you said April. Can you just tell us the process because this change is
obviously for the DFAS, CCAR banks with the reintroduction of share repurchases with an income limit. Can you
just share with us what your process will be with the Fed to announce your capital action plans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Sure. A lot of the rules that we all know really concentrate – are only applicable to CCAR banks. So while those
rules do not necessarily apply to us, they sort of set the stage of the – it telegraphs to everybody what the Fed is
willing to consider, right, conceptually. So, we're watching very attentively what those rules are.
