Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our fourth quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are again supported by our
colleagues across the bank, who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses
thrive and strengthen the communities we serve.
Now on to slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are leveraging our
position of strength and executing on our strategic growth initiatives. We are well positioned to benefit during
times like these. We managed our capital levels to enable us to accelerate initiatives during 2023 and support
continued growth. We added key specialty verticals in commercial banking and expanded into the Carolinas.
Second, we outperformed on both deposits and loans throughout the year. Our colleagues are acquiring new
customers and deepening our existing customer relationships. Importantly, we delivered this growth while
effectively managing our deposit beta.
Third, we expect to modestly expand net interest income as we manage the challenges of the interest rate cycle
and are driving increased fee revenues. Fourth, we are rigorously managing credit across our portfolios,
consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Credit trends are normalizing as expected, and we
continue to believe we will outperform the industry on credit through the cycle.
Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategies. Huntington remained resilient through the events of
2023, emerging as one of the strongest regional banks. We maintained our disciplined execution, and we expect
to grow earnings over the course of 2024 and continuing into 2025 and beyond.
I will move us on to slide 5 to recap our performance in 2023. Huntington delivered solid results over the course of
the year against a challenging backdrop. While the banking sector faced headwinds early in the year, Huntington
emerged as a secular winner, gaining new customers, adding over $3 billion of deposit growth, and further
bolstering our capital. We also increased loans by $2.5 billion for the full year or 2% while driving capital ratios
higher. We expect the pace of loan growth to accelerate in 2024.
We added to our revenue base, primarily as net interest income increased by 3.3% for the full year. We
maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and digital capabilities, having again been awarded the
number one ranking by J.D. Power for both categories.
We remained focused on executing our strategies, including growing consumer primary bank relationships by 3%.
Additionally, we completed the realignment of business segments. We also delivered on efficiency initiatives,
including Operation Accelerate, the voluntary retirement program, staffing efficiencies, business process
offshoring, and branch and other real estate consolidations.
We were nimble and opportunistic, adding key talent this past year with the addition of three new specialty
commercial banking verticals. We also expanded our commercial and regional bank into the Carolinas, adding
experienced teams in these attractive and high-growth markets. Additionally, we further strengthened our balance
sheet and drove capital ratios higher over the course of the year. We're getting ahead of proposed industry
requirements. And finally, credit was managed exceptionally well with full year net charge-offs of 23 basis points.
Moving to slide 6, looking ahead to 2024, we have a clear set of objectives. We will leverage our position of
strength to increase growth of both deposits and loans. This outlook will result in accelerated revenue growth and

is further bolstered by fee opportunities. This posture, coupled with our dynamic balance sheet management and
hedging programs, is expected to benefit the revenue and profitability outlook for 2024 and further expand into
2025 and beyond. This aligns with the improving macro backdrop, the higher probability of continued GDP growth
and the avoidance of a hard landing. While we deliver this accelerated growth, we will continue to maintain our
aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.15 and adjusted EPS of $0.27. The quarter included $226 million of
notable items, primarily related to the FDIC special assessment, which impacted EPS by $0.12 per common
share. Additionally, the termination of the pay-fixed swaption hedging program impacted pre-tax income by $74
million, or $0.04 per share.
Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 8.4% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items,
ROTCE was 15.1%. Average deposits continued their trend of growth into the fourth quarter, increasing by $1.5
billion, or 1%. Cumulative deposit beta totaled 41% through year-end. Loan balances increased by $445 million
as we continue to optimize the pace of loan growth to drive the highest return on capital.
Credit quality remains strong. The trend is normalizing, consistent with our expectations, and net charge-offs
totaled 31 basis points. Allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 1.97%.
Turning to slide 8, as I noted, average loan balances increased quarter over quarter and were higher by 2% year
over year. We expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Total commercial
loans increased by $125 million for the quarter and included distribution finance, which increased by $225 million,
benefited by normal seasonality as manufacturer shipments increased due to inventory build of winter products.
Auto floorplan increased by $359 million and CRE balances, which declined by $361 million, including the impact
of payoffs and normal amortization.
And all other commercial categories, net decreased as we continue to drive optimization toward the highest
returns. In consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $295 million; and RV/marine,
which increased by $121 million, while auto loan balances declined for the quarter.
Turning to slide 9, as noted, we continued to gather deposits consistently in the fourth quarter. Average deposits
increased by $1.5 billion, or 1% from the prior quarter.
Turning to slide 10, growth was maintained each month throughout the fourth quarter, continuing the recent trend.
Total cumulative deposit beta ended the year at 41%, in line with our expectations and reflecting the decelerating
rate of change we would expect at this point in the rate cycle.
As we've noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in
terms of the level and timing of the peak and the duration of any extended pause before a decrease. Given
market expectations for rate cuts to start sometime in 2024, our current outlook for deposit beta remains
unchanged, trending a few percentage points higher and then beginning to revert and fall, if and when we see
rate cuts from the Fed. When interest rate cuts commence, we expect to manage betas on the way down with the
same discipline as we have during the increasing rate cycle.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Turning to slide 11, noninterest bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast, with deceleration of
sequential changes. The noninterest bearing percentage decreased by 80 basis points from the third quarter, and
we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during 2024.
On to slide 12, for the quarter, net interest income decreased by $52 million, or 3.8%, to $1.327 billion. Net
interest margin declined sequentially to 3.07%, in line with our forecast. Cumulatively over the cycle, we have
benefited from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins, with net interest revenues growing at an 8%
CAGR over the past two years.
Reconciling the change in NIM from Q3, we saw a decrease of 13 basis points. This was primarily due to lower
spread, net of free funds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 2-basis-point negative impact from
lower FHLB stock dividends and a 2-basis-point reduction from hedging.
Turning to slide 13, let me share a few added thoughts around the fixed rate loan repricing opportunity that will
benefit us over the moderate term. The construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate,
10% in indirect auto, which is a shorter, approximately two-year average life, and 10% in ARMs with a four-year
average life. The remainder of approximately 30% is longer average life fixed rate.
We've seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle. Even as the forward curve
forecasts lower short-term rates, many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing
opportunity for some time to come. We forecast approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of fixed rate loan repricing
opportunity in 2024, with an estimated yield benefit of approximately 350 basis points.
Slide 14 provides the drivers of our spread revenue growth. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop
action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and
guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the lower end by a scenario, which
includes five rate cuts in 2024.
The higher scenario assumes rates stay higher for longer and tracks closely with the Fed's dot plot from year end.
This scenario assumes three cuts in 2024. We continue to be focused on managing net interest margin in a tight
corridor. Should the lower rate scenario play out, and we see rate cuts as early as March, that will likely result in a
margin over the course of the year within a range near the level we saw in the fourth quarter. This would equate
to a net interest margin between 3% and 3.1% for each quarter of 2024. If the higher for longer scenario comes to
pass, we expect the margin to expand and at a level that is up to 10 basis points above that.
As we saw in December, the outlook for longer-term interest rates also moved lower significantly. There were a
number of benefits from this lower market rate outlook. First, that resulted in higher capital levels, given AOCI
accretion, which supports our accelerated loan growth outlook now. Second, it provides for easing deposit
competition over time. Third, it provides credit support for borrowers with the potential for locking in lower long-
term rates. However, the rate outlook is incrementally more challenging for full-year spread revenue than the
levels we had seen underlying our guidance in December.
Net of these items, including the forecasted pace of loan growth, we now expect net interest income on a dollar
basis to trough in the first quarter before expanding sequentially from that level over the course of the year.
Turning to slide 15, our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $93 billion and has grown
quarter over quarter. At quarter-end, we continue to benefit from a diverse and highly granular deposit base with
5

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
70% insured deposits. Our pool of available liquidity represented 206% of total uninsured deposits, a peer-leading
coverage.
Turning to slide 16, our level of cash and securities at year-end increased as we've begun to reinvest portfolio
cash flows during the fourth quarter. This investment strategy is consistent with our approach to continue to
manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time. We have reduced overall hedge duration of the
portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.7 years over the past 18 months.
Turning to slide 17, we've updated our forecast for the recapture of AOCI. As of year-end, we've recaptured 26%
of total AOCI from the peak level at September 30. Using market rates at year-end, we would recapture an
estimated incremental 44% of AOCI over the next three years.
Turning to slide 18, we continued to be dynamic in positioning our hedging program. As the rate outlook changed
over the course of the fourth quarter, we focused our objective incrementally on the protection of NIM in down rate
scenarios and actively reduced instruments that were intended to protect capital in up-rate scenarios. As we
announced in late December, we terminated the pay-fixed swaptions program as our assessment of the
probability for substantial up-rate moves decreased. Over the course of Q2 through Q4, this program worked as
intended, providing significant protection against possible tail risk up-rate moves with a modest overall cost for
that insurance.
Additionally, during the quarter, we added to our down rate NIM protection strategies, adding $2.1 billion of
forward starting receive fixed swaps and adding $1 billion of floor spreads. We exited $2 billion of collars, which
were near expiration. Our objective with respect to our down-rate hedging activities remains unchanged, to
support the management of net interest margin in as tight a range as possible.
Moving on to slide 19. Our fee growth strategies remain centered on three key areas: capital markets, payments,
and wealth management. Note, this quarter, in our earnings materials, we've updated the presentation of our
noninterest income categories in order to more clearly highlight our strategic areas of focus and more closely
align to the way we manage the business. Slide 35 in the appendix provides further detail on the components of
each line item.
These three key focus areas for fee growth collectively represent 63% of total noninterest income. We're seeing
positive underlying growth in each of these areas.
In capital markets, we're pleased that revenues expanded sequentially. Both advisory and core bank capital
market products grew in the quarter. Our outlook is constructive for 2024, and we expect capital markets to
remain a key driver for fee revenue growth over the medium term.
Payments and cash management revenue includes debit and credit card revenues, along with treasury
management and merchant processing. Our payments opportunity is substantial, reflecting 31% of total fee
revenues today, with the potential for significant growth over time.
Wealth and asset management revenue has benefited from the realignment earlier this year, which brought
together our private bank and retail advisory businesses under one umbrella. Our advisory penetration rate of the
customer base continues to increase as wealth advisory households have grown 11% year over year, and assets
under management are up 16% from a year ago.

Moving on to slide 20. On an overall level, GAAP noninterest income decreased $104 million to $405 million for
the fourth quarter. Excluding the mark-to-market on the pay fixed swaptions and the CRT premium, fees
increased by $5 million quarter over quarter.
Moving on to slide 21 on expenses. GAAP noninterest expense increased by $258 million and underlying core
expenses increased by $47 million. As I mentioned, we incurred $226 million of notable item expenses related
primarily to the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund special assessment during the quarter. It also included the last
portion of costs related to our staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding
these items, core expense included higher personnel and professional services, driven by seasonally higher
benefits expense, incentives as well as consulting expenses.
The level of expenses we saw in the fourth quarter is largely consistent with the dollar amount we expect quarterly
over the course of 2024. This is inclusive of the investments we've discussed previously, as well as sustained
efficiencies we are driving across the company.
Slide 22 recaps our capital position. Reported common equity Tier 1 increased to 10.3% and has increased
sequentially for five quarters. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.6%. This metric increased 58
basis points compared to the prior quarter, driven by adjusted earnings net of dividends, as well as the benefit
from the credit risk transfer transaction we announced in December, which more than offset the impact from the
FDIC special assessment.
We also saw significant benefit from AOCI recapture given the move in rates during the quarter. Our capital
management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund
high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI, into our operating range of 9% to
10%.
On slide 23, credit quality continues to perform very well, and with normalization of metrics, consistent with our
expectations. Net charge-offs were 31 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than Q3 by 7 basis points and
resulted in full-year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. This outcome was aligned with our outlook for full-year net
charge-offs between 20 and 30 basis points at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net charge-
offs of 25 to 45 basis points. Gross charge-offs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat, with the overall change in
net charge-offs largely a result of lower recoveries.
Given ongoing normalization, non-performing assets increased from the previous quarter, while remaining below
the prior 2021 level. The criticized asset ratio increased quarter over quarter, with risk rating changes within
commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses was higher by 1 basis point to
1.97% of total loans. And our ACL coverage ratio continues to be among the top quartile in the peer group.
Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. As we mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated loan growth between 3% and
5% for the full year. Deposits are likewise expected to continue their solid trend of growth between 2% and 4%.
As a result of the loan growth and margin outlook I shared earlier, net interest income for the full year is expected
to range between down 2% to up 2%. The pace of loan growth, coupled with the rate scenario we see actually
play out, will drive the range of spread revenue.
If the higher for longer rate scenario plays out and loan growth tracks to the top end of our range, we expect net
interest income to grow by approximately 2%. If the lower scenario comes to fruition and loan growth tracks to the
lower end of our growth range, we could see spread revenue declining 2 percentage points. In both scenarios, I
expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter before expanding throughout 2024 from that level.

Non-interest income on a core underlying basis is expected to increase between 5% and 7%. The baseline of
core excludes notable items. The mark-to-market impact from the pay fixed swaption program as well as CRT
impacts. Fee revenue growth is expected to be driven primarily by capital markets, payments and wealth
management.
Core expenses are expected to increase by 4.5%. This level reflects the finalization of our budget and includes
the additional loan growth we discussed earlier, which will have some incremental compensation expense tied to
production. Expenses could fluctuate depending on the level of revenue-driven compensation, primarily
associated with our fee-based revenues, including capital markets. The tax rate is expected to be approximately
19% for the full year. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be between 25 and 35 basis points.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers. Tim, over to you.

Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask
only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add
themselves back into the queue. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of
Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.

Hi. Good morning.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hi, Manan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to start off on the expense guide change. I know it's a small change from 4% to 4.5%, but it is higher
than some of your peers are guiding to for 2024. Just hoping you could elaborate more on what's going into that.
And also, if there is a similar flex on the expense side as there is on the revenue. So, for instance, if you get to –
you're down 2% NII, a number with more rate cuts, does that drive a little bit of flex in the expense side as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Great question, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that. We – the guidance that we've given back in October and in
December was really primarily designed to be an early view for you, so you can get an insight into some of the
8


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
key decisions we we're making for us to really be able to discuss that in detail. That was approximately 4% we
discussed before.
The finalization of our budget reflects the additional loan growth that we've now added to the plan and associated
fee revenues as well that's what represent the difference of the 4.5%. To give you a sense, it's about $5 million a
quarter, so relatively small.
I think you are – the underlying drivers of that are unchanged from what we had discussed before. We'll continue
to drive significant efficiencies in core based on expenses with a number of programs. We'll continue to invest in
our strategic growth initiatives. We'll execute on the incremental build of capabilities in automation and data, get
ahead of the coming regulations, and we'll execute on the new, really attractive commercial growth opportunities
we discussed before. All of that's included in that number and no change to our expectation as well about
reducing that growth rate as we go into 2024 – 2025, excuse me, back to more normalized levels.
As it relates to your question in terms of the kind of marginal sensitivity of it, certainly, that will lead to some
degree of that. I think the expense guide is generally calibrated for sort of the middle of the ranges we've guided
in terms of revenues. And so, [ph] there will be (00:25:57) some potential upside of expenses, if all of the
revenues hit the high end and likewise, some potential opportunity if revenues were at the lower end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. And my next question was on the deposit franchise. You have a pretty strong core consumer
deposit franchise and some of your peers have highlighted that there's still some lagged upward repricing in
deposits there. So, can you talk about how you expect those deposits to behave over the next few quarters and
then, as the Fed begins to cut rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. I'll take that one again. What we've been seeing here in the marketplace broadly with respect
to deposit costs and deposit beta, both – across both consumer and commercial, is the, [ph] as what you expect
(00:26:44), a deceleration of the sequential changes and very much for us trending highly aligned to our
expectations. As well, I will tell you that we are beginning to see in the marketplace a fairly constructive initial
signs of firms preparing for what will likely be soon, a [ph] down-rate (00:27:04) environment with a shortening, for
example, time deposit terms, with a change of promotional terms on money market and select testing of different
price points for each segments and each geographies, all of which is what you'd expect to [indiscernible]
(00:27:23) be a series of downgraded moves.
With respect to your specific question on consumer and sort of will that trend, I think the answer is yes. What we
have been saying all along is that, deposit costs and beta will continue to trend at a decelerating rate through the
pause period, until such time that there is a great reduction. And so, that's our expectation as well.
I won't say the go-to-market pricing is generally pretty consistent if not again testing somewhat lower price points,
but there's of course, sort of an embedded momentum of somewhat upward bias in terms of pricing for at least
another quarter here. And then we'll see. Do we get a rate cut in March? Somewhat aggressive in our view is
possible, in which case, downgrade begins very quickly, is that the rate environment hold out the deposits in
September, in which case is of the kind of a longer period of [indiscernible] (00:28:18).

question.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. And by the way, whoever wrote that script, the guidance could not be any clearer. So, that was
great. Just that being said, a few follow-up questions. The loan growth guidance from your peers would imply that
the macro outlook, which seems pretty consensus is indicative of softer opportunities. And perhaps this is a good
chance. Clearly, you've been telling us for the past few years that you've set yourself up differently and you've set
yourself up differently to outperform. And maybe go back through those opportunities that they think that the
average loan growth number is certainly notable versus peers. And perhaps remind us of why Huntington has a
particularly unique set of growth opportunities for this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Erika, this is Steve. I'll start with that, because you've asked a broader history. And then, Zach, you may want to
add. So, first, we do think that the discipline on our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which has been in
place now for 14 years, has been a governor. And it has helped us as we've decided what business to pursue and
what not to seek. With that in mind, we've been very purposeful and strategic about growing these businesses.
And you saw at the Investor Day a mid-teens rate of growth in like a specialty banking.
So, we have a very strong middle market core banking set of capabilities. We have a tremendous amount of small
business capabilities and capacity. We have market density in Ohio on small business. And we're achieving that
now in other states. So, the core sort of regional banking franchise performing very, very well.
And you add to that these specialties that have been put in place, just three new ones last year, which, by the
way, they're all off to terrific starts. And then the expansion we've been in, like Dallas and Charlotte for a decade
or more. When we see opportunities, we then pursue them. And an example of that is in the Carolinas, where we
believe we've got fantastic group of new colleagues coming to us with teams. These are some just outstanding
people that we've been following for years, and it all came together. We were investing. Others were not. And
there was a moment to be dynamic.
In addition to that, we still have opportunities in these TCF markets. We're doing incredibly well in Michigan. But
where I would say we're early stage still in Chicago, the Twin Cities and Denver, and we like those markets, each
of those markets. So, we believe with the investments we've made in specialty banking, the core regional bank
performing well with opportunity. We've got lots of growth potential in the next few years. And that's with the – I
didn't talk about the asset finance business.

So, our distribution finance business is a horse. They had a phenomenal year last year. Our auto business is one
of our best businesses. We've got one of our really terrific teams in that area, and floorplan has done very, very
well in terms of its growth as well. So, lots of growth options. The equipment finance more broadly, a lot of growth
options in that, and you're seeing that through the cycle. And so, we believe we're poised to outperform and had
budgeted and expect our colleagues to do so in the coming years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Zach. I just want to talk about two things. First of all, thanks for the compliment in terms of the guidance,
and all the credit to our really terrific Investor Relations team. But just the one thing I would add on top of that is
we were pretty purposeful about staying on a growth footing across the board and importantly in terms of the
financial resources and investments that we're putting against our core growth opportunities.
And recognize that the net outcome of that, including some of the other things that we want to do in terms of data
and automation capabilities, would result in an overall expense growth that was higher than we would want to
have relative to revenue growth, but higher than we would typically target and it certainly was something we
discussed at length, as you know.
But we took that view purposely and recognized it was contrarian because the – in our view, that the long-term
earnings potential of staying in that growth posture is so much more advantageous than worry to a really
significantly ratcheted back investments and expenses. And so, a bit of short-term challenge with respect to
operating leverage will yield very significantly better earnings growth trajectory. Through the course of 2024 and
2025, earnings outlook looks exceptionally strong as well. So, just to tap on to Steve's point, I think the whole
system is really working and an analogy of how to follow the results here.

For sure, and you had the capital, so it makes – it all makes sense. And just a follow-up question, again, so many
moving pieces in terms of the rate outlook but, Zach, maybe update us on your rate sensitivity as of 12/31 after
some of the moves that you made in terms of your balance sheet management. And also, if you could give us a
little bit more detail about what you mean in terms of managing the betas on the way down in a similar discipline.
And I wonder if you could give us maybe your expectations on deposit beta for the first 100 basis points of rate
cuts.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Great questions as well. There's a lot in there to unpack, so let me address those both. As it relates to asset
sensitivity for December, I expect it to be roughly consistent with the asset sensitivity we saw that was reported in
October. And you'll see that come out in the Q – sorry, in the K. As we've discussed over time, the business is
naturally asset sensitive. And so, clearly on the way up with the interest rate cycle benefited very significantly in
terms of margin expansion and revenue growth.
I will note as well something just as important to assess as you're thinking about asset sensitivity is in our
securities portfolio, as you know, we hedged a large portion of available-for-sale securities, which has benefited
significantly in terms of yields rising higher and protecting capital in the asset sensitivity metric in the
[indiscernible] (00:35:24) for example, it represents about 1 percentage point of additional sensitivity from those

swaps. Those swaps will roll off over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And most of that impact of sensitivity
will begin to ramp off starting the second half of 2024 and continuing on for about a 12-month period thereafter.
The other thing I'd just say is that as an important point is those sensitivity metrics are pretty academic and not
standardized across the industry with lots of assumptions. The beta being the most significant, but also whether
those analyses are ramps on top of the forward curve or whether they're just from the start point, ours is a ramp
on top of the forward curve. So, certainly, it was important to assess those assumptions pretty carefully in
comparing those metrics across firms.
So, in terms of our balance sheet management posture, incrementally from here, I see the opportunity to add
downside rate reduction hedges. Our hedging strategy is incrementally shifting from a focus on capital protection
to a focus on down-rate protection, as we discussed in the prepared remarks. And we added some of that in Q4. I
suspect we'll continue to be incrementally adding into those down-rate protection strategies over time, which
would gradually reduce downside asset sensitivity.
In terms of deposit beta and what we would be expecting for the first X basis points are to give you a sense, in the
scenario that I'm looking at where rates in fact begin to fall in March and then have five cuts in a little more than a
year scenario, we would expect to see about 20% roughly down beta over a three-quarter period by the end of
2024; would, of course, be less than that if there was an extended pause during [indiscernible] (00:37:21) summer
time period, but just to give you a sense of sort of the sensitivity to your question.

as you look at their trajectory here and your outlook for earnings and capital, organic capital generation, how are
you thinking about potentially ramping up buybacks and capital return overall? Thank you.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Great question, John. Thanks. This is Zach. I'll take that one. Well, we're very pleased with the outcomes around
the overall action plan we have with respect to managing capital and capital priorities throughout the course of
2023. As we've talked about, actively modulating the pace of loan growth to balance additional loan growth and
revenue with also accreting capital in the balance sheet clearly, in the fourth quarter, benefiting significantly from
a recapture of AOCI, which allows us now to even yet again accelerate the pace of loan growth as we discussed
earlier.
And for the foreseeable future, I see us continuing on with that posture, driving – the most important capital
priority we have is to fund high return loan growth. And there is a significant opportunity for us to do that, which is
the most value-creating decision that's in front of us. And importantly, at 8.6%, our adjusted CET1 is – it has been
rising a lot and we want to drive that into the 9% to 10% operating rate that we discussed over time.
So, I think for the foreseeable future, we'll continue on with that plan. Once we get into the 9% to 10% range with
adjusted CET1, we'll reassess our posture with respect to share repurchases. Over time, share repurchases are
very, very important point – part of the valuation creation model for the company and I'd also expect us to get
back to them. And we're going to drive through those outcomes as soon as we possibly can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A

And, John, as Zach shared with you in the third quarter call, we are advancing and if the pending capital
requirements are in place. So, we're building capital now that will meet those requirements should they be
adopted.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Great. All right. Thank you. And then also for you, Steve, I guess, related to that, maybe if you could just talk
about the whole debate around the need for scale as you look longer term, at the evolution that's going on right
now within the regional banks, both the last year's failures and so the regulatory requirements and the need for
scale to compete. How do you view the potential for whole bank M&A has a role in Huntington's outlook? And
what's the earliest, do you think, from an industry perspective, not necessarily for Huntington, that do you think we
can actually see a pick-up in whole bank M&A, given the backdrop in regulators?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, that's a series of questions, John. I'll try to answer them, but I may miss on one aspect. Let's just back up for
a moment. We had three idiosyncratic banks fail and you've seen the rest of the industry sort of adjust and adapt
and respond very quickly. And the core strength of the industry, I don't think is in question now.
For us, we believe in having a very focused, disciplined, and broadly diversified set of businesses, and we've
been able to build those and achieve that posture and it has served us very, very well as we've seen in the
second half of last year and continuing into this year. So, we're very bullish on our ability to organically grow and
expect – and that's our focus that we'll continue to do that.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
You may see further announcements from us this year in terms of organic growth moves. And I expect that we will
continue to be maybe a bit contrarian but agile as we continue to invest. We think we have tremendous
opportunities already in the business lines that we have.
So, in terms of scale, I think the regulatory response is in reaction to those three failures, is raising questions
about how much tailoring will the industry – or banks will benefit from in the industry over time. The expectations
have clearly increased, as they should, and we are investing in our risk management platform. I think I shared on
the third quarter call, for example, we will have much better intra-day visibility on deposit flows in the near term as
a consequence. There are series of things like this that we're addressing.
Now, I don't know that – we've been investing in risk management since I arrived in 2009, so I don't know how we
really compare to other banks. I think we've always viewed the stress test results where we've been top quartile or
even leading in terms of the portfolio stresses by the regulators as a barometer. And it looks like that was a very
good measure at least at this point. So, we're not anticipating a change in posture at this stage. We don't feel
compelled to we got to do something and yet, at the same time, should there be opportunity somewhere in the
future, we take a look. But it has to be in a risk-adjusted context that makes sense to us. And I don't see that
activity in 2024. I think we've got a tremendous amount of core growth to deliver, and we're excited by that.

So, I want to start, for you, Zach, big picture. So, historically, a steep yield curve has been a positive catalyst for
bank margins and earnings. But given how you position the balance sheet right with the use of hedges, have you
in essence created a way much of that potential benefit in order to have a more stable NIM today?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Great question, Steve. I think the short answer to your question is no. A steeper yield curve continues to benefit
us. Obviously, that environment would be indicative of funding costs, which would represent solid margins against
where asset yields are. I think we're in this really strange environment with inverted yield curves and with the
dramatic reduction forecasted pretty quick here. So, we'll see how it all plays out.
But I think, for us, the puts and takes with respect to NIM outlook in the moderate terms in 2024, one, we're going
to continue to benefit very significantly from fixed asset re-pricing. I tried to provide some incremental clarity about
that in the prepared remarks in the presentation. [indiscernible] (00:45:38) 50- to 100-basis-point moves in overall
portfolio yield in key FX categories will continue to see that benefit us, out – not only to 2024, but to 2025 and
beyond.
Another thing is, for us, the – as of the curve becomes less inverted, we'll see our negative carry from our down-
rate hedge protection program reduce. The negative carry impact, by the way, in Q4, it was around 17 basis
points of drag. We've talked about likely we'll see about 10 bps of that come back to us. If you believe the
scenario will kind of pretty align forward curve here over the next four quarters.
Funding costs, again in a steeper yield curve environment, where short end rates have fallen, will really start to
benefit us in terms of beginning to pivot towards down beta and actually executing on down beta, to Erika's
question earlier. And those things in total, essentially offset for us in our NIM the variable yield reduction that we'll
see when the short end comes down.
So, I still believe that that Goldilocks scenario of a nice upward slope in the yield curve is accretive to margins and
is supportive of it, and the goal we've got is the same, to try to really collar the NIM here, put a floor under it and
really position for upside. And I think the last I'm going to say is kind of getting to your question as well, the
modeling that we have done about 2025 and we've been saying this for a while really highlights NIM expansion
opportunities, which again is sort of a indication that the upward slope in yield curve is positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Zach, I asked the question because earlier you said if the rates stay higher for longer, your
NIM would be about 10 basis points higher in 2024 versus the Fed cutting. But as we move beyond 2025-2026,
there's a clear benefit to the NIM. Are you able to quantify for us, like on a longer-term basis, assuming the
forward curve played out, given the – what's on and what's rolling off, where the NIM could be long term for
Huntington?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. And then by the way, the point on the higher NIM in the scenario of higher for longer, it's not only a
scenario where short ends stays higher for longer, but also longer ends stays higher for longer. I think I will note
much of our balance sheet yields hit off the belly of the curve, to two to five-year range. And so, I think that's an
important point to consider.
Look, over the longer term, I see north of 3%, into the low-3s in terms of NIMs as a sustainable level. Of course,
the business mix continues to shift. So, I think it's hard to really be precise about that, how we were, several years
out, we'll have to continue to do our modeling. But over the foreseeable future, we see that range of sort of 3% to
3.10% in a quicker rate reduction scenario, maybe as much as 10 bps higher than that if rates stay higher for
longer through 2024. And then I would see another step-up into 2025, assuming the yield curve holds generally
[indiscernible] (00:49:03).

Hi, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A couple of guidance clarifications for you, Zach. When you say 1Q net interest income is a trough, how deep is
that trough? How much lower do you – where do you want us to start, I guess, for 1Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Good question. Q1, by the way, is typically seasonally lower, just with day count and just other mix items. And so,
I think we'll probably see a level that is lower than Q4 by around the same amount, that Q4 was lower than Q3
and then begin to grow from there.
And so, it's really about kind of trajectory from there that's really the major difference in the guidance range, given
that if you just pull back loan growth, I would expect in Q1 will be about the same year-on-year as we saw in Q4,
i.e. around 2%. And then sort of steadily accelerating from there and ending the year growing at or even
potentially above the high end of the loan growth range.
The average should be in the 3% to 5% I discussed. It was a trajectory, for sure, during the year. And likewise, in
terms of NIM, I think it's likely that the NIM will likely be at its lowest point in the year in the first quarter and then
kind of rising pretty heavily, depending on the scenario you look at. But that's sort of the general trajectory that I'm
expecting.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. I think it's important to set that up. And then on expenses, when you say consistent, there's a
lot of hand-wringing last quarter on your expense guide. And when you say consistent, are you basically saying
flat-line expenses quarterly for 2024 meaning that all the expense, investments and hiring and things that you've
done are essentially in the run rate today and you don't see a lot of these pressures as 2024 progresses, is that
fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It's an excellent point, really appreciate the chance to clarifying that. Broadly speaking, the answer is yes. The
dollar amount of expenses overall we saw in a core basis in Q4, the forecast we've got and our budget represents
pretty similar dollar amounts overall for each of the quarters during 2024 coincidentally. There's – in my mind, I'll
try to illustrate this picture for you. There's a variety of factors that are kind of offsetting each other and driving
within that.
I would say there's still a little bit of additional ramp-up of run rate, some of the incremental capability investments
that we're doing, likewise, a little bit of additional ramp-up in some of these new initiatives like in the commercial
business. We're also actively tuning our overall strategic investments to modestly offset that.
And then, lastly, you've got these efficiency programs, which are cumulating in their impact over time. The
business process re-engineering initiative we've been driving for quite some time, we internally call it Operation
Accelerate, the business process offshoring initiative which, by the way, is also growing and cumulating. So,
there's sort of a series of factors that are netting together. But the result of it is basically dollars that are pretty
consistent with a pretty tight range in Q4.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
Sure, Nate. This is Brendan, I'll take that. For the quarter, yes, we did see on a basis point respectable, there was
an increase in the commercial real estate side, but I'd want to sort of point you to the dollars there. It was $20
million of charge-offs in the quarter and it really represented three transactions. So, it's consistent with our view of
the real estate portfolio at this time, which is the – from a charge-off perspective, the focus will be in the office
portfolio. That's where we think that there is potential for lost content, which is why we've increased our reserves
to approximately 10% there. And so, what you see in the current quarter is sort of the manifestation of that
message that we've been delivering for some time.
When I take a step back and look more broadly, the portfolio on commercial in general is actually performing
pretty well. I mean, the C&I side of the house has had its individual idiosyncratic issues. But in general, the
strength of the portfolio is the result of our strong portfolio management and our low-to-moderate risk profile that
we target. So, I feel really good about the commercial portfolio at this time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, Nate, it's Steve. The gross charge-offs Q3 and Q4 were $2 million apart, but it was very, very similar. The
difference was in all of recoveries. The three portfolios performing very well, the office portfolio has had minimal
losses, 23 bps for the year. [ph] Q1 (00:55:19) charge-offs is outstanding. We're very pleased with how the
performance has occurred and we're confident going forward. Thanks for the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the criticized assets. So, these also kicked up in the
fourth quarter. Can you talk about what drove that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan A. Lawlor A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Brendan again, Nate. As Zach said in the prepared remarks, it really came out of our commercial real
estate portfolio. The impact of higher short-term rates has persisted, and that's what's reflected in those results.
Again, we had been signaling through the second half of last year that we expected criticized to move up, and
that's exactly how it played out. Again, we have good confidence in our client selection in that portfolio and solid
reserve against it overall. So, I guess I would classify that as just more credit normalization across the portfolio.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just wanted to follow up on the loan growth guide, Steve. It does feel at the higher end of what we've seen over
the last week from your peers. Sorry if I missed it, but give us a sense of how much of this is just market share
gain that you expect versus the underlying growth that you're seeing in these markets and your expectations, I
guess, like the GDP growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, we've had growth last year of 2%. If anything, I think the signal from the Fed pivot will foster further loan
growth for the industry. We are in an advanced position and so we'll capture share from that. But we also have
these specialty banking initiatives in the Carolinas and they begin with no portfolio, so there's no prepayment,
repayment risk, obviously, and that's all net loan growth but – and those groups are off to terrific starts.
We're very, very pleased with the quality of the colleagues we've been able to attract to Huntington. And I'm quite
confident in our teams, both the core teams that they'll deliver in our footprint, especially banking teams. And
frankly, our consumer lending teams are outstanding as well. So, as we come into the year, we've got momentum
and we're going to continue to invest in these businesses and that cumulatively should help us achieve or even
exceed the goals.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess what I didn't hear, Steve, was any mention of fiscal stimulus, the CHIPS Act, et cetera, flowing

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The markets have – broadly speaking, we're talking about 11, 12 states that we're in with our network. But here in
Columbus, which is what you're referring the Intel plant, that plant is well under construction and the supply chain
commitments will largely be made, we think, this year as they move towards opening in the following year. So, we
have some unusual factors that are strengthening the outlook here in Greater Columbus. And we have very, very
significant market share here and lead by a lot in most categories. And – but it will also benefit the broader region
and that's one of just many sectors that have chosen the Midwest.
Think about batteries from East Michigan, Ann Arbor through Columbus. And some of the announcements last
year including the Honda joint venture here in Greater Columbus on the battery front. There's a lot of investment
that's being made in the core footprint, all of which will generate economic benefit for the industry, so – for the
industry and certainly, for us with our leadership position in many of these areas. Thanks for the question.
