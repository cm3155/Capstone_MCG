Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Kerri, and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for
joining us for our Second Quarter Call.
We had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 31%, reaching a record high, and earnings per share were
$2.57. Card Member spending was at record levels. Billed business was up 30% from a year earlier on an FX
adjusted basis, led by a vigorous rebound in Travel and Entertainment spending and continued strong growth in
Goods and Services.
We added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter driven by continued strong demand for our fee-based
premium products. Acquisitions of our US Consumer Platinum, Gold and Delta co-brand cards were all at record
highs. Customer retention and credit quality both remain at exceptionally strong levels.
While our strong growth may be somewhat surprising given the uncertainties in the external environment, there
are number of reasons for our continued momentum.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
First, the decisions we made through the pandemic continue to pay dividends. At the outset, we made it a priority
to be there for our customers, focusing on delivering great service, providing financial relief programs, expanding
our Shop Small initiatives and injecting new value into our premium consumer and business products with
benefits that were relevant to the times.
We then ramped up investments early in the recovery to rebuild our momentum and grow our customer base,
refreshing our premium products with a series of new benefits that enhanced our generational relevance, and we
accelerated our acquisition. These decisions laid the foundation for the strength in customer retention,
engagement and acquisitions that you've seen over the past year and in our results today.
Other key factors driving our performance include the many competitive advantages that we have that
differentiate us, as well as several structural shifts of some near-term recovery tailwinds which you'll remember
we discussed at our Investor Day.
A critical competitive advantage is our global premium customer base which is at scale unrivaled in the industry
with millions of high-spending super prime loyal consumer and business customers across generations and
geographies. Importantly, Millennials and Gen Z consumers are a large part of our existing customer base and
our fastest-growing age cohort, making up 60% of all new consumer Card Members we are requiring and around
75% of the new US Consumer Platinum and Gold Card Members.
Our new customers have excellent credit profiles, are highly engaged in the premium benefits that come with
American Express membership and are spending more from the start of their relationship with us than previous
newcomers, giving us a long runway for growth. In fact, spending by this age group grew 48% in the second
quarter, significantly outpacing other generations.
Our momentum is also being aided by several structural shifts which we believe give us significant opportunities
for growth across all lines of business over the longer term. These include growth in the premium consumer card
space around the world, the ongoing increase in online commerce and digital engagement among consumers, the
strong pace of small business creation and the acceleration and digitizing of commercial payments.
Finally, in the near term, we are benefiting from recovery tailwinds in our businesses outside the US in the large
and global corporate space and in Travel and Entertainment. The travel rebound in particular has been faster and
stronger than anyone expected.
Total T&E spending exceeded pre-pandemic levels in April for the first time and was at 108% of 2019 levels for
the quarter led by strong growth in global consumer and SME spending and a significant uptick in large and global
corporate travel. And we don't see demand in the T&E categories declining significantly anytime soon based on
the strength of future bookings coming through our consumer travel agency and the trends our partners in the
travel industry like Delta are experiencing, particularly in the premium space.
Of course, we are wary of the uncertainties in the current economic environment and the impact it's having on our
business. Historically low unemployment rates is a positive factor, and it's helping to drive our strong credit
metrics, and we continue to see no significant signs of stress in our consumer base.
Inflation is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a modest contributor to our strong growth in volumes, but inflation when
combined with low unemployment also puts pressure on operating costs. For example, like everyone else, we're
seeing intense competition for the best talent. But because our colleagues are a key driver of our success, we
continue to invest in talent, which is having an impact on our operating expenses.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Looking forward, as I've emphasized many times before, we run the company for the long term, and our
investment strategy is grounded in this principle. As we sit here today, we have an abundance of great
opportunities, and we will continue to make our decisions with a longer-term view like we did during the pandemic.
That means we will continue to invest at high levels in those areas that will drive sustainable growth, including our
brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology, and coverage. We remain confident that the
successful execution of this strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan
aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.
Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Jeff.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here to talk about our second quarter results
which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan.
Starting with our summary financials on slide 2, most importantly, our second quarter revenues were $13.4 billion,
up 33% on an FX-adjusted basis, strengthening sequentially from last quarter's already strong 31% year-over-
year growth rate. Our reported second quarter net income was $2 billion with earnings per share of $2.57. Now,
as I said last quarter, given that year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the
volatility that the pandemic caused in credit reserve adjustments, we are including pre-tax pre-provision income
as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter, which we believe gives you additional insight into the trends of
our underlying earnings. On this basis, second quarter pre-tax pre-provision income was $3 billion, up 27%
versus the same time period last year.
So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results beginning with volumes. Starting on slide 3, you can see
the continued momentum in spending from our strong customer base that Steve noted earlier, billed business and
total network volumes were up around 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in the second quarter. We
feel really good about both our year-over-year growth as well as our sequential growth. The second quarter saw
us achieving our highest-ever level of quarterly billed business, and if you were to compare to 2019, the first
quarter was 19% while the second quarter growth rate accelerated even further to 28%. Importantly, our spending
volumes strengthened as we went through the quarter, with the month of June also reaching a new monthly
record high. And as we sit here today, this momentum has continued into early July.
Now I would point out that, when you think about year-over-year growth rates, volumes in 2021 were of course in
a steep phase of recovery as the year progressed, so I do expect that our year-over-year growth rates will
moderate as we progress through the rest of 2022.
Our spending metrics are being driven by both sustained growth in Goods and Services spending and by an
acceleration in T&E recovery in the second quarter. Starting first with Goods and Services spending on slide 4,
we saw year-over-year growth of 18% in the second quarter. We are now multiple quarters into seeing the effects
of the structural shift in online commerce spending patterns which accelerated by the pandemic with our growth
rates remain steady. Specifically, online and card-not-present spending grew 15% in the second quarter. In
contrast, total T&E spending, as you see on slide 5, showed an acceleration in its recovery this quarter even more
than we and many others would've expected, reaching 108% of 2019 levels. The high demand for travel drove a
steep recovery across all customer types.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
This strength in both Goods and Services and T&E spending is also evident as we break spending trends down
across our consumer and commercial businesses with a few other key points that I suggest you take away.
First, beginning on slide 6, Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest global consumer billed
business growth with their spending up 48% year-over-year. I'd also call out that this quarter all other age cohorts
have now reached pre-pandemic levels of T&E spending including baby boomers, who had been slower to
recover.
In our commercial business on slide 7, spending from our small and medium-sized enterprise clients continues to
drive our overall growth with spending up 25% year-over-year. While a smaller part of our business, it is worth
noting the significant acceleration in growth, 58%, of the large and global corporate customers significantly above
last quarter's growth rate. This is a sign of a more meaningful business travel recovery.
So overall, we are pleased that our strengthened spending volumes has exceeded our original expectations for
the year. And again this quarter, the majority of our high level of growth was driven by the number of transactions
flowing through our network, with some modest additional impact from inflation. This positions us well for our long-
term growth aspirations.
Moving on now to receivable and loan balances on slide 8. We saw good sequential growth in our loan balances,
which are now well above pre-pandemic levels this quarter. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also
continues to consistently increase quarter-over-quarter but remains a bit below 2019 levels as paydown rates
have remained elevated. As you then turn to credit and provisions on slide 9 through 11, the high credit quality of
our customer base continues to show through in our extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans
and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And though they did
continue to tick up slightly overall this quarter as we expected, they are trending a bit better than our expectations
when we started the year.
Turning then to the accounting for this credit performance on slide 10. As you know, there a couple of key drivers
of provision expense. First, actual credit performance, which as we just discussed is extremely strong. And
second, changes in credit reserves under the CECL methodology. We built a small amount of reserves this
quarter as our loan balances grew and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our CECL models got
slightly worse relative to the outlook back in Q1, both partially offset by improved portfolio quality. This reserve
build, combined with our low net write-offs, drove $410 million of provision expense for the second quarter.
As you see on slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $3.2 billion of reserves, representing 3.1% of our loan
balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This remains well below the reserve
levels we had pre-pandemic. Going forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly
over time but to remain well below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher level of
reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, given our expected loan growth. But the overall
range and timing of reserve adjustments will be heavily influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves
between now and the end of the year.
Moving next to revenue on slide 12. Total revenues were up 31% year-over-year in the second quarter, or 33% on
an FX adjusted basis, as we continue to see a stronger US dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which
we operate. Overall, these results were above our original expectations.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service
fees and other revenue was up sharply, 79% growth year-over-year, largely driven by the uptick in travel-related
revenues that accelerated this quarter with cross-border spend in particular surpassing pre-pandemic levels.
Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 32% year-over-year in Q2 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can
see on slide 13, driven by both our sustained growth in Goods and Services spending and the accelerated T&E
recovery that you saw in our spending trends. Net card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year in the second
quarter on an FX-adjusted basis with growth continuing to accelerate, as you can see on slide 14, largely driven
by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products as a result of
the investments we've made in our premium value propositions.
This quarter, we acquired 3.2 million new cards with acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum Card Members again
reaching a record high and increasing 20% above last quarter's record level, demonstrating the great demand
we're seeing especially for our premium fee-based products.
Moving on to net interest income on slide 15, you can see that it was up 31% year-over-year on an FX adjusted
basis, accelerating above last quarter's growth rate due to the continued recovery of our revolving loan balances.
Looking forward, while I would expect our loan balances to continue to recover at higher growth rates, the rising
rate environment will likely cause our net interest income growth rate to slow given our sizable non-interest-
bearing charge balances.
To sum up on revenues on slide 16, we're seeing continued strong results and sustained momentum across the
board. So looking forward, we now expect to see revenue growth of 23% to 25% for the full year of 2022.
So the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand, value
propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage, and those investments show up across the
expense lines you see on slide 17.
Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in as expected at 42% of total revenues
for the quarter and are tracking with our expectation for variable customer engagement costs to run at around
42% of total revenues on a full-year basis.
On the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the second quarter. We feel really good about the strong
demand for new card acquisitions as we showed on slide 14. More importantly, we feel good about the spend,
credit, and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into American Express membership, which continue
to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. I would now expect to spend a little over $5 billion on
marketing in 2022.
Moving to the bottom of slide 17 brings us to operating expenses which were $3.3 billion in the second quarter.
There's often some quarterly volatility in this number due to the varied timing of certain accruals and entries. This
quarter, for example, we see the impact of the prior year including a sizable benefit from net mark to market gains
in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. As I said last quarter, and as Steve discussed earlier,
inflation while driving some modest positive impact on volumes is also putting pressure on our operating
expenses, particularly in our compensation costs.
Taking everything into account, we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around $13 billion as we
invest in our talented colleague base, technology, and other key underpinnings of our growth given our
tremendously high levels of revenue growth.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Turning next to capital on slide 18, we returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter
including common stock repurchases of $611 million and $394 million in common stock dividends on the back of
strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3% at the end of the second quarter, within our target range
of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our
balance sheet growth.
Given the concerns about the macro economy in the market, it is worth noting that in the Fed's CCAR stress test
results released last month, American Express was again one of the few firms that remained cumulatively
profitable under the Fed's macroeconomic stress scenario, and we had the highest profit margin as a percentage
of assets of any participating bank.
That brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on slide 19. Our performance year-to-date and our full year
guidance reinforce several points that Steve and I have now both discussed. First and most importantly, we
clearly have momentum across all of the areas critical for us to drive sustained high levels of revenue growth,
including customer acquisition, engagement, and retention, evidenced by our strong Q2 results. Inflation is
additionally providing some modest benefit to our revenues.
The combination of all these things led us to increase our expectations for full year revenue growth to 23% to
25%, up from our original range of 18% to 20%. For now though, our EPS guidance remains unchanged from
between $9.25 and $9.65.
Let me walk you through our thinking there. As I talked about earlier, we feel really good about the strong results
generated by our marketing investments this year, and that's why we now expect to spend a little over $5 billion
for the full year, modestly above our original expectations. Both Steve and I also talked about the fact that there
are some pressures on our operating expenses, particularly around compensation and partially fueled by inflation.
And therefore, we now expect our operating expenses to be around $13 billion this year.
Lastly and most importantly, as we think about our EPS this year, as I talked about in the credit section, while our
credit performance and metrics remain extremely healthy, we can't predict how the macroeconomic outlook will
evolve. That makes it difficult, sitting here today, to predict a precise range of outcomes for any potential CECL
reserve adjustments for the balance of the year. That said, should the macroeconomic outlook not change
meaningfully between now and the end of the year and therefore not have a large impact on credit reserves in the
balance of the year, we would expect to be at or even a bit above the high end of our EPS guidance range.
In any environment, we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a
focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a
sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe just to start on revenue growth, Steve. So it's obviously coming in much better than expected, and you're
choosing to invest more to propel future growth. So I was just hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about
the additional investments that you're making across the company, whether it's in OpEx or in Card Member
engagement. How much of this is offensive to drive revenue growth versus defensive? And then given the
acceleration of investments that we're seeing through 2022, could this position us for better revenue growth in the
intermediate timeframe? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So I think everything that we're doing here is offensive. I mean, you could argue that raising compensation is
defensive, but I think you've seen compensation being raised across. So if I break out the categories, you're going
to see OpEx up, and you're seeing OpEx up for two reasons. Number one, we are investing a little bit more from
an operating perspective, but that investment, the main investment from an operating expenses perspective is,
you can't grow your billings 30%. And with the majority of those billings being grown by 30% by more
transactions, without having more people to be able to serve your customers, to be able to engage with them from
a travel perspective, and you have to remember, one of the huge differentiating factors that we have in our
business model is our ability to serve our customers when and where they need to be served. And as you get
more and more transactions, as you get more and more customers, you do have a step-function increase.
And so a lot of our operating expense growth has been for the additional of people, which is not maybe a popular
topic right now that people are talking about, but we're adding people, we're not subtracting people from our
business. And we're adding people to make sure that we can continue the level of service that we had. And I don't
mind doing that, especially in a growth environment, which is what we're expecting. Look, you're also seeing
wage increase, and you have to pay more to keep your best talent. And so we will do that. That is shortsighted
not to do that and we will continue to do that.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
From a marketing perspective, I've been doing this for a number of years now and one of the things that you hear
us say is, we have lots and lots of good investment opportunities. And to let those investment opportunities go by
the board because, well, we thought we might've spent $5 billion but maybe it'll be $5.2 billion, whatever. That's
shortsighted because we're running the company for the longer term.
So I would say that the investments that we're making – and additional investments in technology are truly all
thinking about the long term here.
As far as revenue goes for next year, look, we're building up momentum. But I think when we came out and said
we were going to grow 18% to 20% this year, there was probably some skepticism, and now we're coming out
and saying we're going to grow 23% to 25%, which is going to put the level of revenue at the end of this year
obviously higher than what we thought. We have a plan to get us to – in 2024 at 10% plus revenue growth on a
sustainable basis which means in 2023 we'll certainly exceed 10%.
What that number will actually be, I don't know sitting here right now. I don't know. But I can tell you, it'll be on our
growth trajectory, and as long as we have good revenue opportunities and as long as we can continue to grow
this business, I will continue to invest. And that's where we are. And as Jeff said, we decided not to, and I think it's
really important, we've decided not to raise our EPS guidance because of the uncertainty with CECL which quite
honestly, we don't have a lot of control over. And so for us to sit here today and say, hey, look, let's just raise it to
then come back in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and say, hey, we had to drop it.
It's fool-hearted but the revenue is what we've seen. And so when we're asked questions about what you think
about the economy and you see a slowdown, if I was thinking there was a slowdown in the next couple of
quarters, I wouldn't be sitting here raising revenue to 23% to 25% so that's how I think about it.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. T&E was a big driver of the upside and I think, Jeff, you mentioned there's been further
strength in July which makes sense given we're moving into the heart of the summer months. Are you guys
concerned this is sort of a pull forward and you see a slowdown thereafter? And maybe that ties into what we saw
in corporate T&E because that also moved up quite a bit. Where do you think the new normal shakes out?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A

All right. Thanks [indiscernible] (00:28:51).

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So if you look at where we are right now and, yes, we're at 8% growth over 2019, and that's not really a big
number when you think about it. When you think about 8% growth over 2019 from a T&E perspective, and you
think about sort of airline prices, you think about some of the inflation built in, I'd say there's more room to run on
T&E. And when you disaggregate sort of T&E and you look at it and you see that the consumer is running sort of
38% above, you got international consumer running only 8% above, and you've got SME running probably 8%
above and corporate travel is only 60% of what it was in 2019, I wouldn't call that a pull forward.

American Express Co.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
And then when I look at my bookings, my future bookings in my consumer business, they're strong. And then you
start disaggregating, you go below those numbers, and you look, and you say, okay, what's really driving it? And
you see a tremendous growth, right? We're seeing a tremendous growth like 48% growth in restaurant, lodging is
huge, airline is way up, but lodging and airline are still below 2019 levels in aggregate. And the airline industry is
probably only about 85%, 90% of their capacity and they have some staffing issues and what have you, and
they're sort of canceling.
So I don't think this is a pull-forward at all. I think there's a huge pent-up demand obviously to get out and travel
and see the world or see anybody at this particular point in time, but no, I'm not really concerned about a pullback
because I don't think we've gotten to a normal level yet. I really don't believe we've gotten to a normal level of
T&E. So, now, are we going to see 90% year-over-year growth rates? No. But I look at absolute aggregate
numbers and I can't get too focused on just the growth rates. We're not at a normal level of T&E yet in our
business.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Yeah. It's really great, great results here. I wanted to dig in a little bit on how you're thinking
about the loan growth on the SME side. I know that's been accelerating here. And just give us a sense as to
where pockets of opportunity are and how you would flex if there was a slowdown. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Look, our stated goal for SME business is to be the working-capital provider for small businesses. And so I think
that what we're trying to do is to be able to provide liquidity to them using cards. We've got some short-term
working-capital loans, we've got some shorter-term term loans, and they're taking advantage of it.
But I'll send you back to the pandemic. I mean, when you look at our small business base, I think everybody was
really concerned about how stressed this was or how stressed this could be because of what the perception is the
makeup of small businesses. And I've said this over and over again. When people think about small businesses,
they think about restaurants, they think about small retail on Main Street. And it's much more than that. And so I
think that, and you saw how we performed. I mean, our credit metrics performed brilliantly through the pandemic.
And we've always grown in the last few years a little bit, well, pre-pandemic, we've always grown faster than the
market. We have a very low share of our small businesses lending volume relative to their spending volume. I
mean, we probably have over 40% of their spending volume, but – 40% of their spending level, but we have less
than maybe 20% of the lend. So there is opportunity, and we will go after this opportunity the same way we go
after everything else, in a very measured, analytical and risk-adjusted way. And so we're not trying to grow crazily,
we are just providing our customers with what they need.
Having said that, I think you've seen our ability to pivot, and if need be, we will pivot again. But what I do really
love about our small-business base not only that it continues to grow, but it is so diverse across so many different
types of industries, and that's really, really important.

Hi. Thank you. Good morning. And also congratulate you on super strong numbers are really great to see. I guess
maybe a question on network coverage, one of your key areas of focus and incremental investment. And just
maybe any update on how you're performing versus your plan on network expansion? Kind of obviously
international seems like where you have the most opportunity from a network expansion. Any thoughts on or any
metrics you can give on international and your thoughts on where your coverage should be internationally over
the long-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I mean, look, I mean, from a US perspective, we continue to remain at parity coverage, and as we – virtual
parity coverage. And as we've said, it doesn't mean you're not going to run into somebody that doesn't accept the
card now and again, but usually when we do that, we're able to sign them up because it's sort of old news in
terms of what the rates are and how we – and so forth. So I'm not really – I shouldn't say I'm not concerned about
the US, but I like where we are in the US, and I like our approach to the US.
For International, I think we've been really, really clear. We've been focusing on priority cities and continuing to
drive those numbers higher, and those continue to do well. We've probably signed well over 3 million merchants
this year, which is I think we're on pace to sign as many as we did last year from an international perspective. And
we'll continue provide information not on a quarterly basis but on an as-needed basis to show you that the
progress that we're making. But we're really pleased with the progress that we're making in our priority cities. And
that doesn't mean we're not focused on signing every merchant that doesn't accept the card. We do, but we think
it's more important to sign those merchants where Card Members actually are. And that's why the priority cities
and the priority countries are so important for us.
And we feel really good about it. And you only have to look at the international spending to say is it really working.
And when you look at sort of our international spending this year, it's up higher than our consumer spending year-
over-year for this quarter. So it's a big driver for growth for us.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. I had a question for Steve about the 48% growth in Millennial and Gen Zs. I assume it's normal for the
younger generations to have stronger growth just as a combination of what I assume are kind of stronger new
account acquisitions and also just the ramping of spend as they age, and their incomes grow. Can you give us a
sense of what the breakdown is in that 48% between new account acquisition and then actual organic spend on
an individual account basis? I know you indicated that they are spending more than previous newcomers. But any
sense of kind of dimensionalizing that, how that compares?
And then just finally on comparing across the different cohorts. Kind of what your market share is for these newer
cohorts compared to Gen X and boomers at a couple points in their age.

Yeah. So we don't really get into all of that either in our release or talk. But let me give you a couple of points.
When we look at sort of how we're getting Card Member spending, we really look at share of wallet. Share of
wallet is really important for us. And from Millennials and Gen Zs, we're getting a higher share of their wallet off
the bat. That's key, because what happens is with a lot of our boomers and so forth, especially our boomers, they
were used to an American Express that was accepted in a limited universe.
Our Gen Z and Millennials are used to an American Express that's really accepted everywhere. And so we're able
to penetrate their wallets more right out of the gate because, number one, they're more card savvy and they tend
to use no cash. And they're more value proposition savvy, and they tend to figure out how to utilize the card in the
best way for them. And so we're getting a higher percentage of their wallet. As they grow, as their wallets grow, as
they progress through life, our aim is to continue to keep that wallet share and that's a big deal. Plus, as you
acquire Gen Zs and Millennials, they tend to have a longer runway or tenure with the card product.
As far as the 48% growth and breaking it out sort of, I mean, really, what you're asking for is same store sales
versus new store sales. I don't really have that at the tip of my fingertips here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. We don't disclose the exact numbers, Mark. But we do pull it apart, just like you described. And we
certainly have made the point that a disproportionate share of our new account acquisitions are going to that
Millennial and Gen Z demographic. But then when you break out, just to Steve's phrase the same-store sales, it is
also the fastest growing demographic on a same store sales basis. So both contribute – both the same store
sales effect and the fact that they are disproportionate in our new customers.

Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Great. Thank you so much. Obviously, you're reporting incredibly strong recovery spending numbers. If you
just think about the spending cycle and inflation boosting nominal PCE versus real PCE, how should we think
about the effects on your high-end consumer base versus the average US consumer in terms of their
susceptibility to a spending slowdown? And perhaps, why could this customer base that you have act differently
versus the average consumer in the next spending cycle? I'm just talking about total spending if that works.
Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think the simple answer is they have more money. But when you look at sort of what's going on in the
economy and the stock market going up and down, we have – we've never really been tied to that. I mean, and
I've been here forever, right, 35 years or so. And I've never seen a correlation between that. What I have seen a
correlation between is sort of unemployment and people losing their jobs and not being able to pay their bills. And
so that's potentially an issue down the road, but we're in a very crazy sort of environment.
And Jeff called this out in his own remarks. I mean, we've got high inflation and low unemployment, and it's
actually hard to hire people right now. And so, yes. You're seeing some layoffs and some companies talking about
slowing down their hiring and things like that. But it's not broad-based, and it's not broad scale at this particular
point in time.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
And so I think as far as I look at this – the cohort that we have, which is a small segment of the US population but
a very powerful segment of the US population, you would have to see a huge credit crunch driven by
unemployment, I think for this covert to be hit.
The other thing I would say is when we pull apart our numbers, the spending is not inflation driven. And that's not
to say there's not inflation in these numbers, but you have to remember that coming out the end of last year when
no one wanted to talk about it, we had inflation in those numbers last year. So whether you look at 8% or 9% sort
of spending inflation out there in the environment, it's not an 8% or 9% benefit to our business because you do
have a grow over.
But the most important thing for us is we're seeing an increase in transactions, and that's what's really driving our
growth right now, is an increase in overall transactions in our business. And that's an important indicator for us.
We look at not only transactions, but we look at transaction size. And then we look at that transaction size a little
bit on a normalized basis as you take the effects of inflation out, and we've got real growth when you do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that we have said consistently a modest level of inflation, and I still use the word
modest for where we are, absent a spike in unemployment like Steve said, is generally net a positive thing for our
business. It helps revenues a little bit but puts a little pressure on cost, but it nets to a positive. And as long as the
labor market stays where it is, that's why we feel pretty good about the guidance we've given you for the rest of
the year.

Yeah. I mean, this environment has been a highly competitive environment since the financial crisis, and it hasn't
really changed. Yeah. I mean, people invest in more things. I mean, we've all raised the price of [ph] pokey
(00:44:33) here a little bit, but we figure our competitors will continue to invest. We figure that our competitors will
copy what we're doing. And that's why it's important for us to stay ahead.
And so, has it intensified? We just work under the assumption it's a highly competitive environment and will
remain a highly competitive environment.
And you're really talking about the US Consumer segment, but you've got high competition in small business.
You've got high competition in various markets. You've got high competition in corporate card. But what we strive
to do is put the best products and services out there, and that's worked out pretty well for us.
And so, yeah. It requires a little bit more investment. It requires investment across the board. But in the long run, I
think you just have to look at the results. And right now, we're acquiring more cards than we've ever acquired, but
we've said this before. What's really important for us is that we're looking to acquire revenues, and we're looking
to acquire billed business. We talk in terms of cards, but those cards are generating new billed business and
generating revenue for us obviously because we're raising our revenue guidance.
As far as corporate, I'm not sure I really understand the question all that much, but we only have a corporate card.
And, yeah, companies are spending, but we're only at – our T&E is only at 60%. And, Jeff, where are we overall
on corporate card spending? I don't know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
It's a little higher because the travel never went down as much, so the overall number is at about closer to 80%
pre-pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So, but we're not back yet, but you're seeing pockets of it. And consultants are back out there on the road, and
bankers are back out there on the road, and I think people are having a lot more meetings. I know we had one in
June, and it was hard to get conference room space for like 100, 150 people, and even looking to book for next
year for the same type of meeting, boy, people are out there booking a year, year-and-a-half in advance. And I
think that's good for the lodging business, it's good for the airline business, and it's good for us. So that's kind of
where it is.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Well, I mean, we're always making – there's always a balance between long-term investments and short-
term investments, and we don't talk a lot about the long-term investments till they actually happen. But you have
to invest in your technology, and we've done that, and I've talked about that before because we've been one of
the only companies that have said we're not taking step-function changes in our technology investment because
we've been investing in technology all along.
We're constantly investing in value proposition, and when people look at that and we sit here on the phone here
and we talk about it, it's like, okay, so what are you going to do to the Platinum Card? Well, it's not the Platinum
Card, it's the 29 proprietary countries that we operate in and the small-business cards that we operate in those
countries and the corporate cards we operate in those countries and the co-brand cards we operate in those
countries and the personal cards, Green, Gold, Platinum and Centurion.
So we're constantly investing, and I think we used the Platinum Card in the US, either business or personal, as a
proxy for our overall investment. And that's not it, because we're investing in all our card products across the
globe on an ongoing basis. You can't have product refreshes by just snapping your fingers and saying, hey, we're
going to have a product refresh. This is months and months and months in the making and negotiations and
partnerships and so forth. But look, we continue to invest in our lounge program. We continue to look at those
things that add more value. I mean, you've seen the expansion of things that we've done, whether it's checking
accounts and debit cards for our consumers and our small businesses.
And what we're trying to do is to create more stickiness and more reason to interact with American Express on an
ongoing basis. I mean, just look at sort of how the services around our card products have evolved over the last
few years, whether that be from a small business perspective where we can meet a wide variety of your working-
capital needs, banking needs and so forth and then look at from a consumer perspective and look at what we've
done with Resy with over 30 million registered users on Resy and we have cards on file, a huge acquisition. So
we'll continue to make those longer-term investments, but you'll continue to hear about them as they happen.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And, Steve, we certainly note your comments that you're not anticipating a recession in the next
couple of quarters given what you're seeing in your customer base. But could you just talk conceptually about how
you think about account acquisition in terms of kind of new accounts, a high level of new accounts, obviously?
The industry as a whole is still doing that, but clearly less-seasoned accounts are the ones that always would
carry somewhat more risk. And maybe talk about things you do to kind of mitigate that or steps you would take if
you saw that unemployment rate start to rise. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, let me maybe start, Moshe, by just reminding everyone of the highly analytical process we have for
determining who we bring in to membership in the franchise, and it's based on searching for that premium
customer, whether they're a consumer or a small businesses. It's based on the vast amounts of data and history
we have. And it's based on having very high financial cutoffs for who we allow into the franchise or not.
16


American Express Co.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
And when you look at the outcome of that process right now, we are on average bringing in new customers who
have higher credit qualities than we saw pre-pandemic in 2019 who are showing much higher spending profiles
and who are also carrying balances at a greater rate. So we feel really good about the people we're bringing in
into the franchise. And as you've heard Steve and I and Doug and others talk about, we also always when we
bring people in, model their results, assuming there will be a recession. I don't know when there'll be a recession,
but there will be. And so we build a through-the-cycle view of the economics right into our upfront calculation of
whether we think it's a good idea or not to bring a given customer into the franchise at a given level of marketing
spend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
And the other thing I'd say is that changes. That can change daily. That can change weekly. Those criteria could
change monthly. It all depends on how we're looking at and what our models are showing and what we're feeling.
The other reality is that we could lower our thresholds, spend even a lot more money, but there's that balance that
you have and that balance of making sure that we're growing the bottom line in an appropriate fashion and also
making sure that we have a higher quality consumer and small business as part of our franchise. But it is
something that has been developed over many, many years, and it's not static. I mean I think that's the key point.
This thing is not static, and we continue to adjust it and modify it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
You know, Steve, the other thing I would add and I'm going to quote you is, we run the company for the long term.
We make these decisions on a through-the-cycle basis. There will be a recession at some point, don't know when.
But the thing about recessions is they're always followed by a recovery. And we're running the company to
achieve the highest possible sustainable level of long-term growth. And we think that the process we have and
the analytics we have for bringing people into the franchise are very consistent with that.

Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig – try to dig a little deeper on the Travel and
Entertainment recovery in the slide 23 you had and revisit the question about possible pull forward. I heard the
commentary around bookings, and so that seems good for visibility for airlines and lodging. What I'm wondering
about is should there be any reason to be concerned around restaurant spending, which has been really strong?
And is restaurant spending highly correlated with lodging and airlines? Maybe we don't need to worry about it? Or
just if you're seeing anything that could be a cause for concern and maybe a future pullback in restaurants...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I would say is that if restaurant spending is really highly correlated with lodging and airlines, you
are going to expect it to go up. But I think, look, anybody who has been to a restaurant, prices are a little bit higher
because they've got wages and they've got food cost and so forth. But you know look, from my perspective,
restaurants really sort of a lot of them change their business models during the pandemic because restaurants
that weren't doing take out, do take out. And so people are eating out a lot more and they're spending more time
at restaurants and ordering from restaurants. So, no, I really don't think it's highly correlated at all.
17


American Express Co.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
And in fact, if you took restaurant out and we just said travel, and travel being defined as car rental, lodging, and
air, we're not back yet right. What's pulling T&E over the finish line here to go past that 2019, is truly restaurants.
So, if anything, as people travel more, you might see more restaurant spending. Or the other side of that is you
won't see more restaurant spending because now they'll eat in a different location. I don't think a pullback here will
really hurt restaurants all that much.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When I think about the numbers, two things stand out. One is the loan
growth, and the other is obviously the strong penetration for Millennial and Gen Z card growth. I am curious if as
Millennials and Gen Z customers are taking cards, if those are being delivered with additional features enabled on
borrow, or are there behavioral factors that are causing your younger demographic to borrow more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, maybe I'll start, Steve. So first, we have moved over the last couple of years, Rick, to add to the majority of
our charge products a pay overtime capability. For existing Card Members that phases in in a variety of ways. For
new Card Members that capability is on as it is, as they get the card. So I do think that has some impact on our
results. There also is a demographic feature as I talked about earlier. If you look at who we're bringing into the
franchise now and there is a skew towards the Millennials and Gen Zs. They are higher spending, higher credit
quality, and there is a propensity to carry balances that is a little higher than what we see in the older
demographic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. And they also tend to use our Pay It Plan It feature a little bit more which is, and I'll use these words, buy
now pay later, but on the backend as opposed to a point-of-sale. I mean they can go on to their statement and
decide, look, for this particular charge I'm going to pay it in six installments and I'm going to pay it at $100 a
month. I'm going to pay the rest of my balance in full. So I think that capability of looking at your statement,
deciding which things you might want to pay in installments, deciding which things you might want to use pay with
points to pay, deciding which things you might want to revolve, and then deciding which things you want to pay in
full is a pretty good feature of the product. And so when you look at meeting somebody's entire payment needs,
boy, that kind of does it in a one-stop shopping.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Hi. I wanted to ask a little bit about just longer term, right? I appreciate your comments about making investments
now while the opportunity is available. But I was wondering just your longer-term for example in 2022 you've
guided to higher than longer-term revenue growth in 2023. So will that also translate into higher than long-term
EPS growth or higher than long-term PPNR growth?
Or is there just so much white space available for you just the amount of growth opportunity that 2023 could also
be another big investment year? Just trying to understand how you balance that, all those revenue upside you
see versus the investment opportunities available to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I can't resist, Mihir, starting by pointing out that, yes, Steve and I talked a lot about the heavy investments
that we're making this year. We're also growing our pre-tax, pre-provision profit by 27% this quarter, in line with
the 31% revenue growth.
Look, as Steve said earlier, we'll have to see. I think we feel really good about the revenue momentum we have
and so just mathematically given our long-term sustainable goals in a steady-state environment for 2024 and
beyond, I expect to be above that, easily above the 10% level on revenue growth next year. How much? Don't
know. We'll have to see. And that provides a pretty darn good platform for good earnings growth. All that said, it's
only July 22. We haven't given you guys specific guidance for next year and the wild card from a GAAP EPS
perspective in all this is the volatility that you've seen so much of in the last ten quarters in the CECL credit
reserves because we have good, I think, visibility and beliefs about the trajectory of our own business, but the
consensus macroeconomic forecast and how it evolves is going to have a big influence on what we put for credit
reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
But just think about those two numbers that Jeff threw out, 31% revenue growth and 27% PPNR growth. Would
you have felt better if it was 32% and we decided not to invest? I mean, I wouldn't. I think what's really important,
and I'll take you back to Investor Day, this is a flywheel. Scale is important. Scale begets more scale. And not
crazy scale, but scale with premium Card Members from a small-business perspective and a consumer
perspective that merchants want to see, and merchants want to provide value to, which continues that strength of
the flywheel.
And that's one thing, as you know we've talked about, that you see more competition. The one thing that is really,
really hard to replicate, and we haven't used these words, but this enclosed cycle that we have, otherwise known
as the famous closed loop, the ability to have those merchants and have those Card Members and to be able to
feed off one another from a value perspective is really, really critical. And the value that we're able to provide
merchants with high-spending Card Members and the value that those merchants are able to provide to our Card
Members is really, really important.
And so as we sit here and look at our business and look at it long-term, what's really important is that growth and
that sustainable growth. And again, throw all the noise out around CECL and credit reserve releases and bills and
so forth, and if you focus on that number, boy, 31% and 27% is pretty good. And so we feel really good about the
level of investment that we've made in the business and, quite honestly, don't necessarily focus on any of those
19


American Express Co.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
individual line items but focus on the aggregate in what it's driving and the value it's creating. And if you're just
going to measure value through a quarterly EPS growth, you're missing the point. What you need to measure
value is on how sustainable your business model is over the long term. And all we're doing is enhancing our
business model over the long-term with these investments.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Can you provide an update on B2B progress? Are you seeing small businesses accelerate
their automation of accounts payable? And also, large corporates on the supplier side, are they accepting more
cards?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
The short answer is yes. We're not sharing all the statistics, but small businesses continue. When you look at our
small-business base, probably over 80% of their spending is B2B spending versus T&E spending. And we
continue to see acompay go up for us. Our partnerships continue to yield more value. We're seeing, and Jeff
talked about it, we're at about 80% of where we were from a corporate card perspective but yet only 60% from a
travel perspective, so that's driven by more B2B. But it's not, when you look at that automation of B2B, some of it
is automation of existing business, especially in the small businesses, some of it is growth, but it still continues to
be a long-term play. But you're seeing more suppliers take it, and we'll continue to work towards getting more
acceptance and leveraging our flexible model here to be able to work with suppliers and our small businesses and
our corporations to drive more acceptance and to drive more spend.
