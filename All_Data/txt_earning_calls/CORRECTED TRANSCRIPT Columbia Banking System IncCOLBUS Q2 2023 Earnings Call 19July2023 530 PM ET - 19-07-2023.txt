Jacquelynne Bohlen
Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Towanda. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter 2023
results, which we released shortly after the market close today. The earnings release and corresponding
presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks this afternoon, are available on our website at
columbiabankingsystem.com.
With me this afternoon are Clint Stein, President and CEO of Columbia Banking System; Chris Merrywell and
Tory Nixon, the Presidents of Umpqua Bank; Ron Farnsworth, Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Namdar, Chief
Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and are
intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. For a list of factors that may
cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to slide 2 of our earnings presentation as
well as the disclosures contained within our SEC filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures
alongside our discussion of GAAP results. We encourage you to review the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations
provided in our earnings release and throughout the earnings presentation.
I will now turn the call over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Jacque. Good afternoon, everyone. It was another productive quarter for Columbia. Merger
integration activity remains a heightened priority, but we are nearing its completion as milestones continue to be
achieved on or ahead of schedule. I'm pleased to report we have already surpassed $100 million in cost
synergies. We remain on track to meet our original target over the next two months and additional opportunities
beyond $135 million have already been identified. We're four months out from the system's conversion that took
place in March, and our teams are benefiting from unified systems, products and services. They have the
necessary tools and support to win new business and expand existing relationships as we use our scale to drive
revenue synergies across both legacy customer bases.
Our enhanced footprint provides new opportunities to deploy successful businesses into new markets which
supports our strategy to drive balanced growth. However, the current environment is not without its challenges.
Our balance sheet is not immune to quantitative actions affecting industry deposit balances and contributing to
the modest remix of our deposit base. Our talented associates, service-driven operating model and expansion in
newer markets provide us with opportunities and resources to retain our favorable placement within the industry.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
As I look at our footprint throughout eight Western states, I'm excited by our prospects to grow our business in
each of these markets.
I'll now turn the call over to Ron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. And for those on the call who want to follow along, I will be referring to certain page
numbers from the earnings presentation. Starting on slide 4, we are projecting achievement of $105 million in cost
synergies as of June 30. Again, we are well on track to hit the $135 million annualized target as of September 30
and are targeting the higher number by year-end as we complete the final stages of integration.
Next on slide 5, we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter and at
closing. For the AFS portfolio, the acquired discount was reduced $20 million via accretion to interest income. In
our earnings release detail, we include this $20 million along with $17 million of higher bond interest income from
the portfolio restructure we completed post-close to arrive at the $37 million of total accretion for bonds. On the
loan side, we had $30.5 million of rate accretion and $7.1 million for credit. The total marks declined $75 million in
Q2 through a combination of accretion to interest income and the loan sale.
Slide 6 covers our liquidity, including deposit flows during the quarter. For comparability, we presented the table
on the left as if we were combined for all periods presented. Total deposits declined 1.8% in the second quarter.
Market liquidity tightening and the impact of inflation on consumer spending continued to pressure customer
deposit balances. We utilize short-term brokered deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings to fund the
outflows and maintain the higher on balance sheet liquidity.
The upper right table details are off-balance sheet liquidity with $10.3 billion available as of quarter-end. Below
that, we had cash and excess bond collateral not pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of $18.1
billion. This represents 134% of uninsured deposits as of quarter-end.
On the next page, slide 7, we detail out the investment portfolio. The upper left able takes you from current par to
amortized cost to fair value. Noting the difference between current par and amortized cost is the combined net
discount which will be accreted to interest income over time. The decline in market value this quarter, of course,
resulted from slightly higher market yields on the front end of the curve. As you can tell, I'm excited about this
portfolio as it does give us significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality. The overall
book yield was 3.58% with an effective duration of 5.7 as of quarter end. And lastly, we only have $2.4 million in
[ph] HCM (00:06:15) bonds, which represents some CRE-related bonds with no unrealized loss.
To better help investors, given the combination accounting and moving parts on slide 8, we provide an updated
outlook for 2023 on several key financial statement items. Our lower NIM assumptions incorporate the second
quarter's funding remix. Guided ranges incorporate stability at the upper end of the range and continue to remix at
the lower end. Our GAAP NIM is further impacted by lower accretion estimates, as higher interest rates have
slowed prepayment assumptions, delaying the realization of the discount into income. Our expense outlook
includes an estimate for the FDIC special assessment we expect to hit in Q3. And we continue to expect a
quarterly expense run rate ex-CDI in the $240 million to $250 million range in Q4. This run rate includes the
realization of all cost savings by September 30 and is unchanged from last quarter's guide.
Slides 10 through 12 provide summary financials for Q2, but I want to take you forward to slide 13. Here, we
break out Q2 GAAP earnings to help investors understand the non-operating and merger-related impacts and
4

resulting core bank results in the far right column. The first column represents our Q2 GAAP fully combined
results with the net income of $133 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The second column includes our non-
operating designation for income statement changes mostly related to fair value swings, along with $29.6 million
of merger costs included in non-interest expense, which are detailed out in the appendix. These net to a $36
million reduction in Q2 earnings, resulting in the third column for operating income. Now our operating income for
Q3 (sic) [Q2] on a fully combined basis was $169.4 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, with our return on assets at
1.3% and return on tangible common equity at 21.1%.
Fourth column presents the net effect of the merger accounting, which net to $29 million, or $0.14 per diluted
share. Taking us to the last column, we show the core bank excluding the merger accounting benefit with solid
results of more than $40 million in income, or $0.67 per diluted share, and 17.5% return on tangible equity. While
this is lower than expected when our combination was announced, it reflects higher borrowing costs with QT
deposit outflows. Even with the higher interest expense, it is great to see the benefit of this combination with a
17.5% return on tangible equity excluding the net merger accounting benefit.
Now I'm going to reiterate this, page 13 is the key page, the bridge from GAAP reported earnings, isolating non-
operating and fair value changes, then the merger-related items of discount accretion and CDI, and then to
adjusted operating income. The discount accretion will be a steady and reliable source of interest income over
time as the majority is driven by rate, not credit, providing with a steady build of capital over time as well. We
continue to clearly highlight it here to aid investors in valuing both the accretion and the core bank appropriately.
Okay, with that, moving ahead for a couple more items. Slide 15 breaks out accretion from net interest income.
Slide 16 does the same for the margin. The decline in NIM from the prior quarter and from prior expectations
resulted directly from higher borrowing cost to offset the QT fueled deposit decline. The NIM excluding PAA for
the month of June was 3.26%, slightly under the Q2 level of 3.32%. And the excess liquidity held on balance
sheet had a roughly 17 basis point impact on the month of June NIM.
Slide 17 breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio, noting 42% is fixed, 28% is
floating, and 30% are adjustable.
And slide 18 provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock
scenarios. We have taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate
environment. As you can see here, the trending over the past few quarters where our rates break down – or our
rates down risk have been reduced significantly.
And noted below, we calculate our cycle-to-date funding betas, which are calculated on a combined company
basis over the periods presented for comparability. As of the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit portfolio
has priced in 31% of the Fed funds rate increases. Notable here is the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which at
1.83% for the month of June matches the quarter-end spot rate of 1.83%, highlighting stability.
And finally, in the back, on slide 28, we highlight our regulatory capital position, noting our risk-based capital ratios
increased roughly 20 basis points in Q2. We expect to quickly approach our long-term capital targets of 12% on
total risk-based capital, which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Thank you, Ron. Turning to slide 21, origination volume of $1.2 billion in the quarter was offset by prepayments,
payoffs and the decision to sell roughly $500 million in non-relationship loans, as outlined in our earnings release.
Excluding sales and reclassifications to held-for-sale, loans expanded by 5% on an annualized basis during the
quarter.
Slide 22 detail select characteristics of our loan portfolio by major category, with added details surrounding
production during the second quarter. Additional industry detail for our commercial portfolio is provided on slide
23. And slide 24 provides a number of data points on our office portfolio, given investor focus on this asset
category. I encourage you to review it in detail as it provides credit and repricing information on this diversified,
granular portfolio that is primarily supported by properties located in suburban markets.
Moving on, slide 25 highlights our reserve coverage by loan category. Additionally, the remaining credit discount
on loans provides a further 25 basis points of loss-absorbing capacity. The $16 million provision expense
recorded during the quarter reflects several variables, which include stabilizing credit trends in the FinPac portfolio
and reserve release associated with non-relationship commercial loans that were sold and reclassified.
Slide 26 provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends. In general, our credit performance is and has
remained positive ex the anticipated trend in FinPac charge-offs. As previously communicated, FinPac charge-
offs remained elevated during the second quarter, still centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio. Early-stage
delinquency trends continue to improve, indicative that a plateau has been reached, charge-offs will retreat at a
lag. There is no indication of any spillover to the broader commercial portfolio or other sectors within FinPac.
Excluding FinPac, charge-off activity at the bank remains at a very low level.
I'll now turn the call over to Tory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Frank. Turning to deposits, slide 27 highlights the quality of our granular deposit base. Market liquidity
tightening, the impact of inflation on consumer spending, and businesses use of cash contributed to the modest
deposit contraction and remix that took place during the second quarter. Due to the ongoing efforts and expertise
of our bankers, we continue to have a very high rate of customer retention.
We successfully consolidated 47 branches over a four-week period in May and June. An extensive planning
process, proximity of existing Umpqua branches to locations that were closed, and the outstanding customer
service provided by our teams contributed to our ability to execute consolidations without disrupting our
customers or impacting accounts in any discernable way.
As Clint highlighted, we are taking strategic actions to further support our focus on relationship banking. The sale
of non-relationship loans aligns with our intent to deploy liquidity into business-generating activities that provide
more balanced growth opportunities. Continued expansion of products and services, like deposit gathering
capabilities to support our commercial banking teams and wealth management options within existing and newer
markets, provides avenues for growth and enhance company profitability. We continue to add talent across our
footprint, and our team's success drives our enthusiasm for future prospects.
I will now turn the call back over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Tory. Our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide 28. We remain above both well-capitalized and
internal threshold targets. We increased our regular dividend during the second quarter to $0.36 per share,
highlighting the foundational strength of our combined organization. And as Ron discussed, we expect capital to
continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters, providing us with ample flexibility for future shareholder return.
This concludes our prepared comments. The team is now available to answer your question. Towanda, please
open the call for Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your
line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks, and good afternoon. Clint, maybe you could just tackle that last comment that you had on capital. It looks
like your CET1 target now north of 9% or north of the target, I should say. I guess, just [indiscernible] (00:17:20)
question that, I mean, you raised the dividend, but kind of want to see or check in on the attractiveness of a
buyback or further from here potentially on the dividend, either an increase or special from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. So, if you think about the various ratios, the one that is the, I guess, the constraint at the current time is total
risk-based capital. Our long-term target for that has been for quite a while is 12%. And so, we still got a little bit of
room to grow into that target. And just in general, if you take the regulatory requirements to be well-capitalized at
150 basis points, so whatever ratio you're using, that's going to align pretty closely with how we think about our
optimum long-term targets. So, we're not there on total risk-based capital yet. But when we do get there, and as
we've talked over the past couple of quarters and in our prepared remarks, capital will accrete pretty quickly. And
all those things you mentioned will be things that we'll discuss with our board, and certainly remain distinct
possibilities in terms of regular dividend, special dividend, and the potential for buybacks, but not in the next
quarter or so, I don't think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. Then checking in on the, I guess, the expectations for deposits in the second half, both deposit
flows, I guess that's the first question on balances. The second question would just be your betas. See the total
beta at 19% or interest-bearing at 31%. I think Ron mentioned maybe some indication of some stability there. Just
wanted to check in on your terminal deposit beta expectation. So, one part deposit flows, second part is sort of
the terminal beta. Thanks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Hey, Jeff. Good afternoon. This is Ron. Let me take the last part of that, and I'll come back to Tory for the first
part. So, on the betas, yeah, we're at the 31% cumulative, our model is closer to 50%, 53% per the footnotes on
that page. But as we said pretty consistently in the last couple of quarters, we expect to be below that by the time
we get to the end of this recent cycle or at least a couple of quarter lag on the back end of that. So, I'd expect
continued modest increase in that beta, but staying well shy of the 50%. Tory?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, if you look at the kind of the flow deposit, we did a lot of analysis over the course of the quarter. I
mean, kind of go back to slide 27, you look at the granularity of the deposit base. I mean, our average consumer
deposit is $19,000. Our average commercial deposit is $107,000. And most of the analysis really just showed this,
the flow of cash is normal business usage and some quantitative tightening inflation is up, but just kind of normal
business activity and normal business usage.
So, pipelines for us on deposits look really, really strong. And as we went through conversion and the teams were
out, they've kind of turned their attention outbound, and really working hard to generate a lot of activity. So, we
feel really good about the energy and the activities that are happening in the company on certainly on the fee
income and on the deposit side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And, Tory, the inflation and market-related pressure impacting deposit levels, has that abated at all? I guess, if we
look at early in the second quarter to where we look at early now third quarter, I guess I'm looking for three
months' look back? Are we in a better spot? Obviously, we have tax season, that's not impacting us seasonally in
the second half. But just want to – I know it's a tough question to answer, but just in firmer footing in terms of that,
the inflation and market pressure items.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think the best way for me to answer that is if I look at even the change in the average account balance
quarter-over-quarter. It's from $20,000 on the consumer side to $19,000 and $118,000 to $107,000. So, it's just a
natural flow of cash being used for business activities. Typically for us, the second half of the year, especially
because of the ag portfolio, you start to see a run up in deposit balances. So, my expectation is, upon looking at
the pipelines and thinking about kind of historical trend, we've got some nice momentum or deposit activity in the
second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. One last, just a housekeeping. The outlook slide on the expenses for the $240 million
to $250 million run rate, I can't carve out; you guys kind of talking about opportunistically you might have more
cost synergies than you announced on the deal. Is that inclusive of those additional opportunities or are we
looking at something lower than $240 million to $250 million and is that timing outside of this calendar year?

Hey, Jeff. This is Ron again. That number does not include the additional above the $135 million. We'll talk more
about that in October call once we hit the $135 million outlook for the balance of Q4, we could see going into early
Q1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, Jeff, this is Clint again. The one thing I would add to that is part of the reason we said early on that we had a
higher internal target was the uncertainty around inflation. But also while the merger was pending, we expanded
our footprint, and we're in some new markets and we're going to invest in those markets. And so, part of that is
maybe a reallocation of that expense into expanding in certain parts of our footprint.

Hey, Matt.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Maybe just on the loan sales. I think they were mentioned in your prepared remarks and in the slide deck. Any
sense for additional sales from here? And just trying to get a sense for whether or not there's deliberate loan sales
still to come. And flattish loan balances are kind of a reasonable forecast consistent with this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi. It's Tory again. Don't really anticipate future loan sales at this point. And where we exited from were just really
transactional participations in larger syndications that just wasn't the right deployment of capital and liquidity from
our perspective. So, it was a good move for the company and right thing to do and really kind of it's over and kind
of it's moving forward.

Matthew T. Clark Q

Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. It's Tori again. It's definitely not the case and not accurate. We existed the multi-family division, which was
a part of the commercial bank that had existed at kind of legacy Umpqua Bank for quite some time, up $3.9 billion
to $4 billion in assets, small garden style apartments, average deal about $2 million and it was just – we just
made the decision that, again, is very transactional. It wasn't in line with the commentary around really strong full
relationship banking. And so, exited that business, but we have many other parts of the company that will
continue to do multi-family lending for our customers in the commercial real estate division and community
commercial banking. So, we will continue to do lots of multi-family lending. We're just not doing it through the
multi-family division.

Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris
McGratty with KBW. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, great. Thanks. Ron, maybe a margin question. Looking at your slide 8, you gave the range of, on a core
basis, 3.10% to 3.30% for Q3, and obviously you talked about what would it take to get to the high and low end of
that. To get to your full year guide of 3.20% to 3.40%, that would imply kind of an exit if you assume the low end
of around 3%. I guess, I wanted to take your temperature on your thoughts about that entering 2024 if the Fed
stays at high rate. Like, how do you view the core margin of this company trending once the Fed is done?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Chris. This is Ron. So, again, the Q3 guide we included [indiscernible] (00:27:45) based off of deposit flows
in the third quarter, and sort of talk a bit about [indiscernible] (00:27:48) see how that plays out. I'm not saying that
the guide says 3% on an exit velocity basis. This is a blended – this is an annual number, but it also recognizes
the fact that the first two months of the year was Umpqua Holdings stand-alone. We closed the combination for
the month of March, and then that's filtered in through the year. So, one would assume if there are stable deposit
flows, we will be pretty consistent in the Q4 as we expect to be in Q3. And again, that's going to be the
determining factor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, the 3.10% to 3.30% range for Q3, that could also be the range for Q4 based on – I just want to make
sure I got that buttoned up. Is that right?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then, on the expenses, I just want to come back to it. I know you've talked
about investing some of the additional savings. Is that kind of what you're trying to message to us that you may
have more to talk about next quarter, but don't go in putting additional cost saves in the numbers? Is that kind of
what you're trying to message?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sort of, yeah. Chris, this is Clint. Yeah. What we stated all along was that we were committed regardless of what
was going on with inflation, tight labor market and everything else to delivering a minimum of $135 million of cost
savings to the bottom line. But that we also were working on other internal opportunities so that we had flexibility
to address those issues. And also during that time period, separately Umpqua and Columbia both expanded into
the Phoenix market. Umpqua expanded into the Colorado market, and Columbia into the Utah market.
Our commitment is to bank – bring our full scope of services and solutions to those markets. And so, part of that,
just frankly, is some retail locations. And we can essentially kind of just put a rough number out on what each
retail location costs us. And so, those are ways that by taking that extra amount – and we'll tell you as we go kind
of – you might read about, let's say, we establish a branch location in Utah. We'll put out a press release, you'll
read about it, and then we'll talk about, okay, here's how we offset the costs. So, I think that's how you can expect
the narrative to go. But it will be outside of the scope of that $135 million that we've been talking about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I could just get to a couple of modeling, quick ones. On the tax rate, a little help
there will be great. And then, the special assessment, most of your banks haven't talked about it dropping in the
third quarter, at least that I've talked to. Is that – I guess, that would be in – is that just a kind of a one-time or a
step up in the investment rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Chris, this is Ron. Tax rate target 25%, [indiscernible] (00:31:22) just a little bit above or a little bit below, but
we target 25% internally. And on the special assessment, the consensus is that it would be expensed once the

Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven
Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello. This is Janet Lee, on for Steve Alexopoulos. My first question is on NIM. So, 3.20% to 3.40% for 2023,
that's a fairly wide range. Can you talk through what level of non-interest-bearing deposit mix is assumed for that
low and high end of that guidance? And what's your bias based on where you stand today in terms of the NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Ron again. And following up just on the comments from earlier. So, if we see consistent flows on the
deposit side like we saw in Q2 in the third quarter, we'd be on the lower end of that range. If it stabilized, we'd be
in the middle. And if it got better, then the upper. Same for Q4 from that standpoint. So, that's simply the driver
there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. Is there – so, relative to 39% of non-interest-bearing deposit mix today, do you think that pace of non-
interest-bearing deposit outflows could lessen from here or will that stay fairly consistent of what you saw in the
second quarter if you look through the second half of 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Again, I'm just going back to what we talked about. If we see consistent deposit flows, including the mix shift,
reduction in non-interest-bearing increase in money market areas, and it'd be in the lower end of that range. Third
and fourth quarter, if it stabilizes, which it has through early – middle of July, but again it's only that middle of July,
there's still two net months ago on the quarter, and that would change, so. Hope that's pretty straightforward,
right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And for the – if you look at the second half of the year, what – is there a level of cash you want to
maintain on your balance sheet over the near term versus $3 billion or $4 billion? Would you contemplate any
borrowing paydowns versus what you have as of the second quarter over the near term?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. In a normalized world, my expectations will be interest-bearing cash flows will be about half of where they
are now. So, you get a sense of what we consider the excess on balance sheet. We think it's prudent in this
environment, just given the uncertainties with the QT fueled the deposit outflows. And I'd also point out that that
cash is sitting at the Federal Reserve running at 5%, 5.25%. So, the net effect of that is that additional $1.5 billion
is pretty small and talking maybe like six times of $0.01 on quarterly basis. So, we just think it's prudent to hold
that at this point just based on the environment till the outlook clears before we make some moves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of the reserve levels, assuming no major changes in economic forecasts, is the
second level reserve ratio a good level you would like to maintain? I understand that reserve releases, some has
to do with the lowered sales, but in terms of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, based on CECL, right, with the economic forecast, that's where we feel the reserve should be. I
think if all else remains equal, which is a big if, right, up or down. It will stay about that level, if not drift down to
closer to 1% over time. And when I say 1% over time, I think about just long-term history of net charge-offs and
then the duration of the loan book, it's generally going to be like 25 bps over the course of four years would give
you at around 100 bps. So, we're a bit above that at this point, based in part on the economic forecast, based in
part on the MRS, et cetera. So, near term, I'd expected to stay around the current levels unless there's a
significant change in economic forecast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And my last question, how should we think about the loan growth for the rest of 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi, Janet. This is Tory Nixon. I think I touched on just briefly earlier, the loan pipeline continues to grow. And we
are looking at a lot of really good, strong opportunities in the company throughout our eight Western states. It's for
relationship banking. We're not making loans for people who don't put deposits with us and we don't provide fee
income opportunities for. So, we're looking at full relationship banking, which is we feel is the best way for us to
carry the bank forward. I feel we have opportunity to grow the loan book, and it's going to be mid- to low-single
digits for loan growth. But I think good, prudent loan growth that supports relationship growth and relationship
banking is what we will continue to do throughout the footprint.

Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess maybe looking at the mortgage revenue, how should we be thinking about revenue there with the
normalized impact from hedging and the planned MSR sale?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Ron. I'd say, levels would be consistent again, assuming rates stay relatively consistent with where
they are now. That's obviously been the big story within mortgage lending over the last year-and-a-half. We are
targeting that sale, $4.5 billion of MSR just to reduce – continue to reduce future volatility. So, that also played
into the fact that you didn't have the MSR fair value gain this quarter because we had locked in that price a bit
earlier in the quarter before you saw some of the [indiscernible] (00:38:08) market. So, still very much core
product and [indiscernible] (00:38:12).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Ron. Jared, I think we've settled into a nice place with the pivot from more of a brokerage model
into more of a bank model. Plenty of coverage out there. I'll tie it to Tory's comments around relationships. We're
seeing our customers come in requesting purchases. It's granular across the footprint, focusing more on held-for-
sale and less on portfolio. But it's still products and it's still out there. We'd still have some construction lending
that's in the pipeline. That's going to wind down over the next couple of quarters as well. But I think the team there
should be applauded for making the shift, making the transition, and I really like the offering that we have in the
current environment.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping maybe just to follow up on the MSR
sale. I know you get the capital relief from the reduction in the MSRs, but I just wanted to ask, did you happen to
disclose what the gain from the sale of the MSR that you expect to book is, just given those are pretty valuable
right now?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
This is Ron. I'd say we carry that fair values, so it's not going to be a gain or loss on sale. We basically price that
$4.5 billion at the locked in sale price, roughly 132 basis points in the overall balance of the portfolio. The overall
portfolio sit at 137% as of quarter-end, so there is some liquidity discount that we've noticed here when it comes
to the market itself with overall, where the levels of that asset is. But no additional gain or loss on that component
of the MSR when it's sold.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And I did just want to follow up also on the loans that you sold this quarter.
Could you just walk me through maybe the accounting of how that works? I mean, what happened to the marks
that were on those loans that you sold? If there was a mark? And then was the negative $7 million change in the
fair value of certain LHFI loans, was that tied to that loan sale at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Brody, this is Ron again. No, the $7 million was related to a separate portfolio that's carried at fair value
and the fact that you had rates increase led to the fair value loss. It'll slip and become a fair value gain when rates
decrease. In terms of the loans that were sold that were marked, we had a roughly $800,000 loss on sale
recognized in Q2. There'll be about a $900,000 gain on sale recognized in Q3. Just given we didn't get all $0.5
billion of that settled, we had $135 million of it sitting in held for sale. We weren't able to recognize it. So it'll be
close to a push. But that just means that the sale price was right on top of our March price in terms of the rate and
credit discounts. So no significant gain or loss on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And I just want to follow up on the NIM guidance. And I hear you on the different
scenarios on the mix shift dynamics. But, Ron, I think we tried to talk about in the past sort of what you're
assuming for an interest-bearing or a total deposit beta moving forward. It's obviously not the 50-plus that
[indiscernible] (00:42:05) last cycle. So just within that kind of 3.10% to 3.30% NIM guide for the third quarter, I
guess what are you assuming for deposit cost or interest-bearing deposit cost?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We're assuming the beta to move as it has over the last two quarters. So, small single-digit increase in the overall
cumulative beta recognize Q3, Q4 but still stay [indiscernible] (00:42:28) by the time we get to the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much for that. And then I did just want to follow up on the mortgage as well.
The gain on sale margins, it seems like there's some differing dynamics amongst the banks this quarter reporting
mortgage results. I guess, is the difference between what we're seeing maybe with you and some others that
have maybe different channels, is that difference between retail origination channels and corresponding
origination channels right now?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
If you're referring to again sale margin being higher than someone else's gain on sale margin, yeah, that could
very much play into it. For example, if it's wholesale, it's going to be a lower margin just by default because you're
paying a commission to get the loan and to resell it. So our gain on sale margins are relatively consistent around
2.7%, I think. Again, that would be subject to volatility in the rate market over the near term. But expect a relatively
consistent number in that range over the balance of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just real quick on the expenses that the FDIC special assessment, I think -- and maybe I
was just quickly doing the math, but it looks like you're saying about $30 million is what to expect. So it would kind
of be fair to maybe talk that in as a onetime expense around that area for the third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We're estimating that just a bit underneath that. So if you take the midpoint of the annual range from last April and
you look at our updated guidance now, you're probably talking high-$20 million range. So somewhere in that
range, we'll see if it gets finalized. And we do expect to expense all of that in the third quarter. So there won't be
any expense tail on it, just be cash paid over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then the last one from me, where do you view the normalized level of liquidity for the balance
sheet going forward? Our cash balance is still a bit elevated. And I guess, if the deposit flows do start to stabilize
at all, would you look kind of maybe use those excess cash balances to pay down some borrowings?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, we talked about this a couple of minutes ago, right? So ballpark, I think [ph] interest-bearing
(00:44:51) cash, in an ideal world, there'd be about half of the level as it is now. We brought on $2 billion back on
March 13 just given the environment, just to be conservative in the outlook with pressures. So given there's still
Q2 deposit pressure out there, we feel it's prudent to hold onto that higher level in spring cash. So as we see that
change, then that target level of on balance sheet cash will change. But it hasn't happened as of this point. And I'd
say too of that $3 billion in cash we're sitting on at the Fed, so that's -- you could – can see that it'd be $1.5 billion
or so higher than ideal world. And that is being carried in the borrowings. When you look at the net cost of that
given we got the cash parked at the Fed, it's roughly $0.006 on a quarterly basis. So the number, it gets
[indiscernible] (00:45:41), but not material. We think it's just pretty bold on the basis of liquidity for the time being.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. I guess one last one real quick. Just within the $6.25 billion that you have in borrowings, I guess like what
portion of that could kind of quickly get paid down? Like how much of it is short-term that could in theory get paid
down through year-end if you decided to do so?

We kept all of that in that call it two to four-month tenor. So an idea that acting like a swap, given a lot of that cash
flow is in the bond portfolio, if you do ever see rates down in the future but two to four months so a pretty quick
turn.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just switching back to the loan side. I appreciate your commentary. Obviously, we're focused on full
relationships. We've exited some of the more transactional businesses. I'm just curious, it looks like the growth
that you did have, excluding the loan sales, was pretty broad based, but where are you still seeing good risk-
adjusted returns right now, and opportunity to gain those four relationships? Are there any segments or markets
where you see more opportunity at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A

Yeah. Hey, David. This Tory again. Certainly, there's a ton of opportunity in this C&I space for us throughout our
footprint. So we've got really high-quality bankers throughout their eight Western states and they have great
pipelines, great prospects, a lot from within the bank, existing customers and then new customers to the
company. So there's a ton of C&I opportunities, a lot of disruption depending on where you go in the footprint. It's
a great opportunity for us. So I see that's a big focus for us and will continue to be. What comes with the C&I

lending opportunity is going to be non-interest-bearing deposits, other deposits, good core fee income, kind of
everything we're looking for.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe just following up kind of on Clint's comments a bit earlier about the
branch locations and supporting the hires that you've made, I guess what's your appetite for additional hiring? I
mean, there's been a lot of disruption and dislocation around you. Is that – are you seeing opportunities for –
would it be more focused on the C&I front? Are there any new segments that you would be interested in
expanding into? I'm just curious how you think about that. And more market expansion or would it be kind of infill
– as we look at some of the expansion, is it infill or truly market expansion at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. This is Clint. The answer is yes for all of those. We're always on the lookout for quality bankers that
can help us grow our franchise long term. And that's in the newer markets. I mean, that's how even with the
pending merger of the size and magnitude that we had. We were able to attract top talent in new markets and
expand into Arizona, Utah and Colorado. And so, with the disruption, yeah, there are some opportunities. I'm
going to pass it over to Tory and Chris and let them talk about maybe some of the more specific things that they're
focused on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Clint. And, David, this is Chris. Quickly on your last question, I would say there's a little bit of
growth, as I mentioned, in that mortgage part of the portfolio of construction. So, that goes along with the
commercial side. As far as locations and segments, I think we've talked over the years about the best time to hire
somebody is when they're available and they're ready versus putting postings out there and trying to go into a
market and build on that, I think you find the best quality bankers. So reiterating what Clint said, the answer is
yes.
Now with some – in that, we're looking at the newer markets of – we should have things out there soon around
Utah, Arizona, follow up with Colorado for some locations to support our bankers, as Tory mentioned earlier. And
then from there, we do see some infill opportunities and we get our hands around some of the opportunities in
Southern California market and things of that nature. It'll look a little different. It'll be branches to support our
commercial efforts, our small business efforts. And you won't see as many or the density that you would pick up in
the Northwest. But, yeah, from there, we're pretty excited about those opportunities.
And I'll kick it over to you, Tory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't think I have much to add. We got a great company with a great opportunity and people want to work here.
And it's a fun story to tell. And I'm looking forward to us to continue to grow the organization.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. And I'm just curious, I guess what kind of branches are you looking to roll out? I mean, is it more
prototypical branches? Are we looking at smaller footprints? And then, where does that kind of neighbor hub play
into this? That was a concept that you guys had been dabbling with. I'm just curious kind of what is the branches
that you're looking to expand look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
They will certainly be smaller. That's anything that we've done where we've had the opportunity to move or lease
things of that nature. We've downsized considerably. Typically, it's more of an open concept. You don't walk in
and see a [indiscernible] (00:52:10) to go along with that neighbor hub concept. We have some things we call
financial hubs that are very similar, but they house other types of bankers in there with that. Neighbor hubs
specifically, there are certainly opportunities. It requires a neighborhood that is a fairly dense, walkable, things of
that nature and we're always on the lookout for it. The last one we opened was in Boise, and it's right in the
downtown core and it's fantastic. If you're over there, check it out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. And then, maybe just touching on credit more broadly, I mean, obviously, you talked about the
impact. But outside of that, I mean, credit's held up pretty well. I mean, NPAs are steady, classified assets were
down. I'm just curious, as you look at your portfolio, is there anything that you're seeing that's causing you any
concern? Or as you look in your crystal ball, I guess, how do you think about credit going forward and what are
you watching perhaps more closely and maybe tighten standards the most?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. This is Frank. Yeah. Our portfolio certainly has held up very well, and I'm personally not surprised by
it. I think what we continue to watch is, you see some of the lower margin, small businesses and consumers,
you're seeing delinquencies start to tick up there. We've got our eyes on that. But quite honestly, I mean, there
are no big cracks developing. I'm certainly watching the CMBS space as it relates to office as those CMBS pools
begin to mature and valuations are completed and we're seeing lower valuations. We don't have direct exposure
there. But certainly on maturing obligations, we are cognizant of the potential impact that could have on valuations
and resizing deals within our portfolio. We don't see that as an issue right now based upon the leverage-averse
nature of our portfolio. But that's something we're watching very closely.

Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe just sticking on the last point on credit and office specifically and loan to values are really low at 57%. The
book is obviously incredibly granular and more suburban-focused. But I was curious, have you had any borrowers
in the portfolio where you have gone through the process of reappraising the loan in the past quarter? Or just
more broadly, as you look at appraisals or valuations that are coming up in the market, have you noticed any kind
of trend or a level that valuations are declining for office properties or any kind of trends you can speak to there
would be helpful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Andrew, they're moving very slowly. We just had one. We just refinanced actually one in our portfolio with
no issue. So it's kind of surprising how really relatively slowly cap rates and valuations are moving. But other than
that, no, we haven't seen anything materially concerning or stressful in terms of rewriting some of these deals as
immature.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate the color. And then on FinPac specifically, I think last quarter we talked about being a potential
plateau in loss rates after that accelerated and we clearly saw a step-up again this quarter. I guess can you give
any color and I know it's trucking-related, but were there a couple of larger deals within the portfolio that you
charged off of this quarter? And can you maybe just help give us some color on why the plateau has occurred
here or that FinPac loss rates should level off or potentially decline?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. We've guided this every quarter. But when you look at year-end 2022, 12/22 quarter and compare the 31-
day delinquencies -- 31 to 60-day delinquencies from that period to 06/30, they are now down 25%. When you
look at 91-day and over delinquencies, they are now over 30% reduced. And that sort of trend has been
happening quarter-over-quarter obviously since 12/2022. So when you look at the -- especially the later term
delinquencies, they are now reducing -- the earlier term delinquencies are reducing in that space. And so that --
this portfolio is extremely predictive in that regard. And so that's why I feel fairly comfortable in saying that the
plateau has very likely been reached and we should see a decline from this point forward. And the loss numbers –
the $25 million in losses in the FinPac portfolio, 60% of it has been related to the trucking portfolio as with the
delinquencies. So if you take 60% off that $25 million, you're left with $10 million. And that's kind of the sweet spot
of where FinPac operates. So things are looking as expected within that portfolio to me.

And then maybe a quick one for Ron, just going back to kind of discussion around the securities portfolio and then
the borrowing position as well. I understand kind of having the flexibility within the marked bond portfolio or the
bonds and a gain position specifically. But I guess with a little over $6 billion of borrowings that are $5.25 billion
costs and potentially moving higher next week given those are shorter term, I guess looking at like the spot yields
on particularly the $2.2 billion of securities in a gain position at 6.30%, a yield of 4.30% on those -- the gain -- the
bonds and a gain position, I guess why not start to unwind or sell some of those bonds and pick up, I don't know,
100-plus basis points on the margin and, obviously, be accretive to the NII as well? I guess, I appreciate some of
the flexibility you've got, but given the kind of underwater nature right now, why not unwind some of that trade?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, hey, this is Ron, yeah, so obviously though, we took the discount through capital to get there, by sell the
bonds at these levels then I'm not going to recapture that. So I'm very much looking at that more as a capital
return over time from that standpoint. And the borrowings, we've got the flexibility to maintain these for the time
being, including the increase if need be over time. So too early to talk about selling off bonds at the discounted
prices. I'd much rather have it – when I have the discount come back and accrete to income over time.

Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Jared
Shaw with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Maybe just a question on the health of the markets. We're hearing a lot about some
of the strain in Portland some of the other cities. How is that -- how are your customers being impacted by that?
Are you seeing more business moving to the suburbs or are you actually seeing businesses and people leaving
the area and moving somewhere else?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think there's a little bit of all of that that's occurring. So I think in the core downtown section of, say, Portland,
businesses have moved to the suburbs. Umpqua Bank is a great example of that. We've seen some of that also
in Seattle. But I'll say this probably isn't a good measure. But the MLB All-Star events were in Seattle last week
and the city showed pretty well. And it's cruise season for the Alaska cruises that leave from Seattle and so
there's quite a bit of tourism that's going on. So there's a little more vibrancy, but I don't think it's businesses that
are housed in those core downtown office towers. Likewise, last night, we had dinner in a section of Downtown
Portland, and it was pretty vibrant. But it was more in the Pearl District area and that tends to – that hasn't really
had the same impact that [indiscernible] (01:02:48) – that you saw on the news with the 70 nights of riots or
whatever it was. So I would say a more optimistic on the core downtowns, but I think that they still have a
challenging path ahead of them.
The suburbs remain pretty vibrant and throughout our footprint. So, during the quarter. Chris, Tory, Frank and
myself, I think we visited customers in six of our eight states and a host of different industries and different sizes,
and they're all very optimistic and their businesses are doing well. And I think that's where you would have seen
some of the optimism in Tory's response to the outlook for loans and then by default deposits because of the
relationship focus that we have is a product of being out and seen what still pretty vibrant markets. So I don't
know if we end up with a soft landing. I don't know if anybody does. When it is, it's the recession that's never
come. But we're seeing a lot of positive things from our customers. And I think that's also why you see the credit
metrics and absent that one little sector of kind of mom and pop trucking operations in FinPac, the credit portfolio
continues to perform very, very well.
I don't know, Tory, Chris, if you want to add anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, I mean, I think you're spot on. I think that the granularity of our markets, we have customers in big urban
markets and suburbs of those markets. And we have a lot of customers in rural parts of the west. And there's so
much variety that it's great for the bank, it's great for our balance sheet and it's great for our earnings stream. And
to Clint's point, going out and visiting all of these customers, the one very consistent takeaway is how well
everybody is doing. And it's great to see. From what you read sometimes in media versus what you get with boots
on the ground, talking to people is very different.
