industry. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings including those found on Form 8-K, 10-Q

President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you listening into the call. This morning, I want to discuss our recently
announced acquisition of The Westchester Bank as well as our targeted efforts to capitalize on disruption
opportunities in our markets. Mike will then provide additional details on the financial results before opening the
call to your questions.
In the second quarter of 2021, we reported net income of $121 million, earnings per share of $0.29, and return on
average assets of 1.17%. For the fourth consecutive quarter, this represents the highest level of quarterly
earnings in Valley's entire history. On an adjusted basis, return on average assets was 1.23%, reflecting strong
net interest margin performance, improved fee income, and a stable provision for loan losses.
Looking forward, we expect that additional balance sheet growth and core margin stability will continue to drive
strong financial performance and shareholder value over time. A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of
The Westchester Bank. We are thrilled with the opportunity to partner with this high-performing commercial bank
and look forward to having President and CEO, John Tolomer, lead our combined efforts in the Westchester
market. This is a dynamic area with significant household wealth and commercial lending opportunities.
Westchester also contributes a strong core funding base and physical delivery presence in this attractive market.
From a financial perspective, we believe the transaction is very well-structured. We expect 1% annual earnings
accretion and no impact to our pro forma tangible book value or capital ratios. Westchester will be nicely additive
to the $425 million of loans that Valley already has in Westchester County. John's team will benefit from Valley's
comprehensive product set and robust balance sheet resources. As a result of this combination, we expect that
Westchester County and the surrounding market will be a source of meaningful growth for Valley in the future.
While we are excited about this transaction, it will not disrupt our organic growth initiatives or prevent us from
considering other strategic opportunities. To that end, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate our M&A priorities
and relevant financial thresholds. We remain interested in potential transactions that would accelerate our
strategic initiatives around sustainable balance sheet growth, enhanced efficiency, and improved revenue
diversity. From a financial perspective, we are focused on tangible book value preservation. To the degree that an
opportunity is strategically compelling, we will be willing to accept a modest tangible book value dilution as long as
the earn-back period is short.
We are seeing some recent transactions with earn-back periods beyond three years which is likely outside of our
comfort zone. At Valley, we have strong organic growth initiatives underway. And while we have the currency to
be competitive, we will not sacrifice in the financial guardrails that we have established. We believe that this
discipline is in the best interest of our shareholders and potential partners over the long term.
Historically, Valley's balance sheet growth has been well-balanced between acquisitive and organic efforts. This
balance is likely to continue over time and we are extremely excited about the organic growth opportunities
currently available to us. During the quarter, we originated a record $2.6 billion of new loans. This was $1 billion
higher than the first quarter and resulted in 10.4% annualized growth in non-PPP loans. The value of our diverse
3

business lines and balance sheet remains apparent as this growth was spread across commercial, residential and
consumer categories.
We continue to see meaningful opportunities in both our northeast and southeast geographies. Our recent hiring
efforts and proven ability to attract and service new clients positions us well to continue to capitalize on disruption
across our entire footprint. We also have a really exciting and unique story playing out in the funding side of our
balance sheet. Over the last few years, we have focused on diversifying and enhancing our core funding base.
On a combined basis, our cannabis banking buildout, digital account opening upgrade, and ability to cross-sell
deposit accounts to new PPP customers have generated nearly $1 billion of new deposits in the last six to nine
months.
We recognize that all banks have benefit to a certain degree from surge deposits and excess liquidity in the
banking system. But these Valley-specific initiatives and others in the pipeline represent sustainable and scalable
future-funding sources that reflect our ability to identify and execute on customer acquisition opportunities.
Capitalizing on the loan and deposit opportunities ahead of us will depend on continued investment in talent,
technology, and new business capabilities.
Over the last few years, these investments have been largely funded by expense savings in other areas. That
low-hanging fruit has largely been captured and future investments may result in some incremental expense
growth over the next few quarters. As with everything that we do, we will be thoughtful on the investments we
make and work hard to find additional offsets in the legacy expense base. We remain laser focused on generating
positive operating leverage over time and any investment will be aimed at driving stronger revenue growth and
long term financial performance.
We are extremely excited about this quarter's performance and the opportunities that remain available to us. Our
growth and performance during the quarter reflect a tremendous team and infrastructure that we continue to
develop. The future is extremely bright for Valley and we look forward to continued success alongside our new
partners at The Westchester Bank.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some additional financial highlights.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 5, you can see that Valley's reported net interest margin increased to 3.18% from
3.14% in the first quarter of 2021. Exclusive of the impact of PPP loans, we estimate that net interest margin
would have been 3.07% versus 3.05% in the prior quarter. This improvement reflects meaningful funding cost
reductions partially offset by the drag associated with carrying a higher cash balance. Much of the quarter's loan
growth occurred in June and will more meaningfully impact third quarter results.
We continue to actively manage the funding side of the balance sheet and drove another 9 basis point reduction
in our interest-bearing liability costs during the quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs continue to decline due to a
significant reduction in time deposit costs and balances. We also benefited from continued growth in non-interest
bearing deposits.
During the quarter, we issued $300 million of subordinated debt at a cost of 3%. We also redeemed $60 million of
legacy subordinated debt at a cost of 6.25% and prepaid nearly $250 million of FHLB advances at an effective
average cost of 1.82%. In the aggregate, these redemptions will almost entirely absorb the annual interest
expense of the new subordinated debt.

Despite significant loan origination activity and our efforts to reduce borrowings and wholesale funding, our cash
balances continue to increase during the quarter, putting modest downward pressure on our margin. We will
remain vigilant and look for opportunities to put cash to work but recognize that we are likely to continue to hold
more liquidity than in the past. You can see more detail regarding the impact of PPP income on slide 6. We
estimate that PPP contributed 11 basis points to the margin versus 9 basis points in the first quarter. As of June,
we had forgiven $1.8 billion of PPP loans, representing over 75% of our round one and two originations. We
expect that the pace of forgiveness will slow somewhat in the third quarter and beyond.
Slide 7 outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to reprice liabilities over the next four
quarters. Of note, we have $1.2 billion of borrowings at a cost of 1.38% set to mature in the third quarter. While
we have capitalized on the majority of the funding improvement opportunities in our CD and broker deposit
portfolios, we continue to grind our non-maturity deposit costs lower. As a result of active balance sheet
management and significant deposit growth, our net interest margin has been extremely resilient over the last few
years. Despite the challenging interest rate backdrop, we expect to preserve a net interest margin in the range of
at least 3% to 3.05% give or take for the remainder of the year excluding the impacts of PPP.
Slide 8 illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding profile. Total deposits increased another 2% during the
quarter fueled by a 5% increase in non-interest-bearing balances and a 7% increase in other transaction
balances. Continuing our recent experience, CD balances declined 21% in the quarter. Non-interest and interest-
bearing transaction accounts now comprise 32% and 55% of total deposits respectively. These dynamics
contributed to the sequential 7 basis point reduction in deposit costs in the second quarter. As Ira mentioned, our
recent growth in low cost core deposits is partially attributable to our unique funding niches specifically in the
cannabis and digital areas. We have also had success cross-selling deposit products to commercial customers
including those newly acquired through PPP. As these efforts continue to accelerate, we will monitor opportunities
to further enhance the efficiency of our physical delivery channels.
Slide 9 details our loan balances and origination trends over the last few quarters. The strong lending pipeline that
we described last quarter resulted in $2.6 billion of loan originations during the second quarter. This represents a
$1 billion sequential increase in origination activity or a 60% increase from the first quarter. As Ira mentioned, this
growth was well-balanced between our consumer and commercial categories and across geographies. Roughly
one-third of the growth was in residential and consumer with the remaining two-thirds split relatively evenly
between northeast and southeast commercial categories.
We continue to prove our ability to attract and service customers across our geographies. We did not sacrifice
underwriting from a credit perspective as both commercial and residential originations remain in line with our
history from an LTV and FICO perspective. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved 7% annualized non-PPP
loan growth. We believe we are positioned to achieve the higher end of the mid-single-digit range that we guided
to coming into the year.
Moving to slide 10. We generated non-interest income of $43 million for the quarter, up nearly 38% sequentially.
The increase was broad-based reflecting a rebound in residential mortgage gain on sale income and higher
income from both swaps and insurance commissions. Fee income increased to 12.5% of total revenue during the
quarter, up from 9.6% in the first quarter. We continue to explore diverse fee opportunities that would contribute to
greater revenue diversity and non-interest income consistency.
On slide 11, you can see that our adjusted expenses increased by approximately 2% to $160 million. Roughly
two-thirds of the sequential increase was for higher cash incentive compensation accruals. As we have
5

consistently stated, we are focused on driving sustainable, positive operating leverage. During the quarter, our 6%
adjusted revenue growth outpaced adjusted expense growth by more than 3 times. This drove our adjusted
efficiency ratio down to 46.6% from 48.6% in the first quarter. While we are proud of the efficiency gains that we
have achieved over the last few years, we are not satisfied. As Ira mentioned, ongoing disruption in our markets
continues to create unique growth opportunities for our organization. Our efforts to capitalize on these
opportunities may lead us to selectively invest in additional revenue-generating talent, technology, and business
capabilities. These thoughtful efforts may result in somewhat higher expenses in the near term, but should
support meaningfully higher revenue over time which will result in further positive operating leverage.
Turning to slide 12. You can see our credit trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses
declined to 1.14% of non-PPP loans from 1.17% in the first quarter. This was the result of significant loan growth
that we achieved during the quarter. From a CECL model perspective, due to the improved economic outlook in
our markets, we replaced the 10% weight on Moody's prolonged slump scenario with a 10% weight on the upside
scenario. We will continue to review these weightings on a quarterly basis. Our non-accrual loan balances ticked
up to 68 basis points from 62 basis points in the prior quarter. This increase was largely driven by a single
construction loan. We have allocated a specific allowance of $3 million to this relationship.
Early stage accruing past due loans also ticked up during the quarter but remained below 2020 levels. During the
quarter, our active COVID-related deferrals declined to $142 million or just 0.4% of total loans versus 0.9% in the
first quarter. Additional detail on our deferrals can be found in the appendix. As we have reiterated throughout the
crisis, Valley's historical credit strength remains a distinguishing characteristic of our organization. As a result, we
are confident in our existing reserve and expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in any
economic environment.
Slide 13 illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the continued improvement in our capital
ratios. Tangible book value has increased 9% in the last 12 months driven by our strong earnings performance.
Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio increased to 7.73% from 7.55% in the first quarter. Adjusting
for a $1.4 billion of PPP loans, tangible common equity would have been above 8% as of June 30. Our total
capital ratio also increased significantly during the quarter as a result of our very successful subordinated debt
issuance. We continue to believe that our earnings power will provide the capital necessary to support our organic
growth initiatives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some closing commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. We are extremely proud of the strong growth and financial performance achieved this quarter. Our
net interest margin has been extremely resilient, reflecting our active balance sheet management and loan and
deposit tailwinds. We continue to identify unique opportunities for growth and remain focused on driving positive
operating leverage. Valley's future is extremely bright. And we are committed to remaining a high-performing
institution for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

question coming from the line of Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.

Good morning, Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the recent lending hires particularly down in Florida. Are those
teams still ramping up and did you add any one in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Frank. It's Tom Iadanza. Yeah. We continue to add where we think we're going to get revenue
enhancement. We added 14 in total in Florida over the last I'll say six to nine months, eight in New York, New
Jersey. We've onboarded three during this second quarter. We have offers out for a few more. We are starting to
experience the benefits of their pipeline build and their pull-forward into loans, deposits and relationships for the
bank. But as you know, it usually takes six to nine months to build the pipeline to start onboarding. But we're
starting to see the benefits of that already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Ira, you mentioned laser focused on positive operating leverage, you also
mentioned the higher expenses due to investments in the near term. Just wondering maybe if you could – it
sounded to me like maybe the efficiency ratio could tick up then in the near term and just wondered if you could
maybe give your thoughts there or any [ph] governors (20:19) around that over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Frank. I think when we look at our adjusted efficiency ratio, obviously, the current number
is impacted because of PPP as well. But we have, as you mentioned, done a lot over the last few years to try to
rightsize the organization based on an appropriate foundation to really grow. We think we've, as we said during
our earlier comments, really gone to a point where maybe there's a bit more focus within the organization on
7

revenue enhancement and putting the appropriate infrastructure in place to really leverage that to a greater
degree.
Mike, are you going to give a bit more commentary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Frank, this is Mike. The revenue lags, as you all know, sometimes, the people investments. And as Tom
said, we've made some of those. And in our prepared remarks, you heard some comments around some other
hires as well. They're not just in the revenue-producing part of the business. So what I would say at this point is
our past run rate the last several quarters was around $157 million. I think our adjusted expenses this quarter of
$160 million are more indicative of what the go-forward run rate will be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Just to put in some kind of context, Frank, when you think about growth within the organization, it's not just on the
revenue side, but some of the new hires that Tom referenced earlier. But it's also on the technology side and how
we think about the [indiscernible] (21:42) of investment on the technology, what the benefit from an automation
perspective is going to look like down the road. On average, we spend about 52% of our technology dollars on
running the bank compared to about 68% according to Gartner where most banks are. So there is a lot of
investment we have internally going in to improve and transform Valley from a customer experience perspective
as well as we think from a overall on the efficiency side. So the dollars that we're spending are both on the
revenue side and on the operating side, on the expense side to really prove out future operating efficiencies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. I just want to make sure I understand though. Now, I'm not so sure in terms of the efficiency ratio. Is it – the
messaging is then that it might kind of hover around here in the near term or could've ticked up in the near term.
Any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
When you back out PPP, it's going to tick up, right? So let's just do the math right there. You're going to have an
uptick just overall based on that. There will be some additional investments that are going to come that, we think,
will provide some positive operating leverage as we continue to move forward and the revenues are going to
follow that. And that being said, as Tom referenced, we hired 14 people on the revenue side about six to nine
months ago. We should begin to see some benefit from them starting in the next quarter as well and that'll
mitigate some of the additional expenses that we're describing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Just to start on the loan side, I know you guys said last quarter the loan pipeline was strong heading into this
quarter but the $2.6 billion was a really great result. Can you talk about the competitive landscape that you saw as
you were booking those originations? And do you think you can sustain that level of originations here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Hey, Steven. It's Tom Iadanza. Our pipeline on the commercial side remains strong. We're about $2.6
billion with half of that being loans that we've approved in stages of documentation to close. That level, that $1.3
billion level is in line with what we reported at March 31. So that piece of the pipeline despite active closings
especially in June of this year is building and that segment of closing is at the same levels as we have in the last
quarter. We are seeing a slowdown on the consumer side especially in auto and on some of the refinance activity
on the resi side. The expectations, slightly over 7% annualized for the first six months we think that number will
hold up in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And what about the competitive environment, Tom, can you comment on that particularly I'm curious northeast
versus southeast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Sure. As you know, there is some disruption from other acquisitions, merger activity in both markets, we're
benefiting from that through the attraction of people as well as customers. We are actively onboarding those
customers we assisted with PPP. We're building loan pipeline and loan portfolio and deposit from that. We have –
what we instituted years back was a very focused customer solicitation program, identifying what a core customer
is for Valley's, identifying programs and processes to onboard them, cross-selling them and then rewarding our
people based on that performance. That's not new that we've been doing that. That has reaped benefits for us
and create a consistency. The northeast has been very steady growth for us though we're getting faster growth in
the southeast. The competitive landscape is active, it's fair, it's not just banks but we are getting our fair share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And, Ira, following up, I think you called that $1 billion of deposits tied from various initiatives
which included the cannabis business. Could you give us an update on cannabis and maybe what portion of
those deposits are in that business now?

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
So at this point, it's about a third of those deposits are coming from the cannabis sector. Yeah. I think we've been
very focused on that, Steve, making sure that we have the right risk appetite day one. We spent about 18 months
devising our internal approach as to how we want to go about it to make sure it was consistent with the risk
appetite at Valley. We have targeted the large, multi-state operators as we think they provide the appropriate risk
for us as we look at who we want to partner with here. And there's really opportunity there. We are banking Tier 1
customers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, and Illinois at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, Ira, just following up on your prepared comments where you ran through
M&A priorities which I don't recall you doing before. Are you signaling that you're maybe more actively pursuing
additional M&A here? And we've seen quite a few larger deals from your peers, how are you thinking about a
larger deal here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Look, I probably maybe a bit more formal today as to some of the financial guardrails but definitely,
internally, and in other conversations, this is sort of I think the guardrails that we're pretty comfortable with. I think
probably today, we're maybe a bit more focused on targets that could accelerate some of the revenue growth or
revenue diversification versus straight-up expense opportunities. That may have shifted a little bit from where we
were maybe a couple of quarters or even a few years ago. We do think there's a significant amount of disruption
in the marketplace today. And as a result of that, there's real opportunity for us to look at leveraging revenue
growth within our footprint as well as individual asset classes. And we're really excited about that. That said, some
of the deals that I've seen where you have three years of tangible book value earn-back just seem excessive to
me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. What about you guys pursuing a larger deal here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Larger than the Bank of Westchester probably.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Well, yeah. Well, even MOE, right? I mean, some of the deals that you've seen have been MOE-like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I think the MOE has to really make sense. I am really excited as is our team about the organic initiatives we have
here. I think a lot of them are really beginning to come to fruition. And if we are to do an MOE or something of
significant size, it has to make real strategic sense for us from the revenue extension perspective. And if it
doesn't, we're very comfortable just going down the path that we're going. We think we're generating, at this point,
10


Valley National Bancorp
(VLY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
well above peer returns, and we think we have a path to continue that and really accelerate it. So by no means
that we feel any kind of pressure by any means that we need to start looking at an MOE because there's
technology gaps that we have, because there's market gaps that we have, because there's talent gaps that we
have. Quite the contrary, I think, our organic opportunities are probably much better than what our peers are and
there's absolutely zero pressure on our end to do anything of an MOE based on being backed into a corner

Michael Perito Q

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A

Hey, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I want to just start clarifying – Mike, just I want to make sure I heard you right on the NIM. So you're saying that
the core or adjusted NIM will be between 3% and 3.05% for the balance of the year here and then PPP will be
either on top of that or detriment to that depending on the pace of forgiveness.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So it will be on top of that. So that's the core. Let's just use the second quarter numbers, 3.18% was the
reported result. Ex-PPP, it's 3.07%. And as a reminder, the $2 billion we had in excess cash you know roughly
weighed on NIM another 2 basis points. So as we think about NIM compression going forward, PPP forgiveness
both volume and absolute impact trailing off as we get more and more of those balances off the balance sheet,
we think that the core NIM stability that we're shooting for is between 3% and 3.05%. I would say that the most
recent quarter coming up bias would be towards the higher end of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. I was just going to say I mean if the growth is where you guys are suggesting, it should be that, that would
make sense. And then on the fee side, I believe you guys had close to if not your highest quarter you've had on
kind of the trust and investment side and then biggest quarter you've had on the insurance commission side in
11

year and a half maybe. Just curious if you guys can comment on some of the trends there and maybe what we
should be expecting near term on fee growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. Hey, Michael. It's Tom Iadanza. On the insurance side, a lot of that is coming through our title company
hence an improvement in our general insurance agency that we operate. The title business will continue to grow
maybe not at the same pace relative to the growth in the refinance in the residential market for us, as well as they
do a lot of commercial business. So we expect that to be steady may not grow at the same pace it's grown in the
last quarter. And I think, overall, our fees on the wealth trust and insurance business should be flat to slightly up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful. And then just last question from me, we saw a couple of articles that had linked you guys to the condo
that collapsed down in South Florida. So just curious if you guys could comment on whether there was any
lending or depository relationship there? And maybe just give us a refresher on kind of how you underwrite those
types of relationships in that marketplace that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Sure. There are – we had no loans outstanding on that property. The general portfolio that we have on the
HOAs relative to our size is small, it's about $250 million of outstandings. The waterfront high-rise is $7 million of
outstandings and less than $25 million in commitments. Our portfolio is primarily inland, around golf community,
single-family and townhouse. From a depository, the portfolio generates $800 million in deposits and, as I said
before, $250 million or slightly less than in loans. Our average loan in that portfolio is $425,000.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Really helpful, Tom. Thanks. And obviously, not a huge number. In terms of the underwriting process of those
types of buildings, is there some type of like property condition assessment that's a part of your process there? I
apologize, it's probably pretty simplistic question but any additional color would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
No. Absolutely. And another reference is following Hurricane Andrew back in the 1990s, the requirements for
building and safety in the buildings was enhanced and the bulk of our loans if not most of our loans were done –
where buildings that were done after those product improvements and process improvements. From an
underwriting standpoint, we have an in-house engineer that reviews all of the advances on any of the construction
or improvement parts of the loan that we may have. And we have third parties who will also review.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Very helpful. So I guess at this point, safe to say that you guys feel – while small in relative size still feel pretty
decent about that portfolio and the properties that are within it?

Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. And again, keep in mind, it's primarily townhouse and single-family homes inland. And it's a deposit business
primarily for us. We lead with deposits in that business.

Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Steven Duong with RBC Capital. Your line is open.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Ira, just your Westchester Bank acquisition and I assume you've been in discussions different markets. Can you
share with us your Florida market [indiscernible] (35:03) versus your Metro New York market? How are they
different in terms of maybe activity and opportunities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Steven, this is Travis Lan. Just though I'd step in and try to respond and then Ira can clean up what I miss.
But the issue with us – look, we'd love to do an acquisition in Florida I think. But that market there's not as many
targets and the targets that exist are highly valued I would say and make the economics a little bit more
challenging. And I think that's why you saw us go out on the more of a hiring push earlier this year because we
identified the fact it was unlikely that we would do an acquisition for it in the near-term. So organic growth
opportunities were more significant and that's where we focus our efforts.
There's more opportunities up in the northeast. But we look kind of that you can tell with Westchester across the
size spectrum. As Ira said, we're focused on strategic opportunities to grow revenues. And Westchester is a very
high-performing bank despite its size. And you can look at the earnings accretion and say 1% is immaterial. But
what that doesn't capture is the opportunity for us to provide them products they don't have today and to
accelerate their growth with our capital and balance sheet resources. So I think that's part of why it was so
compelling. Ira?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I have nothing else to say there, Travis. Thank you.

Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
All right. Cool.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks, Travis. And then just moving on to the loan growth, I mean really great quarter all around. A lot of
the growth came from your CRE portfolio. Can you just give us some color on was that primarily in Florida and
any specific type of CRE?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. It was well-balanced across the regions. Florida represented about 40% of our productions and 55% of our
growth. More importantly was distributed evenly in product types between apartment, industrial, some retail to a
central type of properties. Average loan size was in line with our previous performance $4.5 million was the
average loan size, weighted average loan to value was 53%, and debt service average was over 1.5 times. Very
equally balanced between New York, New Jersey, Florida and Alabama.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's great to hear, Tom. I guess you mentioned that the 7% year-to-date in the beginning it looks like you feel
comfortable that you may be in that range for the second half of the year. Do you expect a similar performance
with CRE as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I would expect CRE will be the – still the larger generator. The C&I business – we're a little hamstrung in that
through our line utilization. Companies are not borrowing if anything they're paying down. Our average utilization
went from 41% to 38% quarter-to-quarter. So we're still producing C&I business slight uptick but it's a little bit
harder of a road.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Understood. I appreciate the color and congrats on the good quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
The only other thing to add is that we also continue to exit non-relationship, low-yielding business and we had
about $175 million of that repaid in the second quarter and $300 million year-to-date primarily assets obtained
through the Oritani purchase at New York City multi-family type. So we'll continue to do that and still experience
the growth that we're suggesting.

Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Matthew Breese with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I'd like to drill down into expenses a bit more. So, Mike, you mentioned that the $160 million of operating
expenses is more indicative of where we're going, but I get the sense from Ira's commentary that the $160 million
is really a starting point where we could see some growth. So my question is what do you expect to add on top of
the $160 million? What is your anticipated growth from here or am I – do I got my read wrong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I don't think you have the read wrong as you look – now, I'm talking about a multiyear lookout. I'm not talking
about next quarter. So in a multiyear lookout, especially some of the technology investments, not so much the
software and the related depreciation but the people that we're bringing onboard to accomplish the technology
buildout over time are going to drive expenses higher over time. It's inevitable.
But I want to point you back to what Ira and I both said to the prior question around it. Those investments are
being made while you mean I get that one-to-one relationship when you actually see the financial benefit of it,
those investments are being made so that we can be a more efficient entity in the future. We can service
customers differently and faster. We can release some of the redundancies in our processes and streamline our
workflows. Those benefits show up after those technology projects are put in place. And I want to be clear about
this. I'm talking about a multiyear kind of view forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Maybe, Matt, maybe I'd just ask that. This is not a first Niagara by any means as to how you think about – when
we think about expenses here. When three or four years ago when we first started talking about some of the
initiatives we were going to do from a strategic perspective, we talked about an incremental $48 million of
technology spend. As you can see, we were able to really layer in that $48 million and we still dropped the
15

(VLY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
efficiency ratio across the entire organization. Every single dollar we spend here has to be justified, has to make
sure that there's an appropriate return on it. We're not doing it. We're not just spending money on technology for
what we think is going to be revenue enhancements but what we think will be franchise-building opportunities.
And they're going to be in line and appropriate with the appropriate revenue growth and earnings per share
growth that we have. It's not going to outpace it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
And this is Travis, Matt. Just from a modeling perspective, right, so we were $160 million of adjusted expenses
this quarter but that included $2 million of what I would call higher or abnormally high kind of cash incentive
accruals. So when you take that out, you kind of add some a little bit of in the expense growth that we're talking
about. It gets you to that $160 million and that's kind of what's – what we're contemplating at this point which is
why I think Mike said that $160 million run rate was a good one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Next question from me, could you talk a little bit about the loan portfolio's exposure to floating rates, how
much is there? And then how much is subject or below floors where if we do get a Fed hike we're not going to see
the benefit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So this is Mike. I'll take a stab at it and I'm sure Tom will join on the end. Within the entire loan book,
roughly 60% of our loans, $18 billion are addressable. And of that $18 billion, $12 billion or so are tied to LIBOR
or prime and they reprice on a regular basis. So your point is, I think, what you're getting at is do we have the
ability to have repricing take place on that 60%? I think we do. There are biases towards that but it's a balanced
portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I did want to talk a little bit about Valley Direct, the digital bank. Can you give us a sense for the use case
here, the capabilities? And the reason I ask is, obviously, the world is increasingly using mobile devices and all
things digital. But during the up-interest rate cycle my gut was that the digital bank offerings from regional bank
peers tended to be strictly deposit-gathering and came with higher deposit betas. So perhaps you could give us
just a quick pitch on Valley Direct's aim and how it would be different and, ultimately, value-enhancing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think we just reported on this in the first quarter. The Valley Direct is really opportunity to revamp our
online account opening process. We don't need it today for a deposit gathering. We're not really using it for that
benefit. We're using it primarily to improve the process, create efficiencies, roll out this account opening process
online in each of our branches developing those efficiencies there. We have seen traffic slow in the branches. We
16


Valley National Bancorp
(VLY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
have seen our online and mobile utilization increase 15% and 25% respectively from last year. And we'll continue
to use that Valley Direct as an efficiency for onboarding new accounts into our system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
But to really just add up on that point, it is not as you're describing, something we're just looking at from a deposit
perspective. It has an opportunity from a platform perspective to be how we think about opening across – SME
accounts across a multi-spectrum of different structures whether it be on the deposit side or on the loan side. We
had the ability to really build a lot of this in-house which was important to us. That gives us the flexibility to make
sure that the customer experience is something that we own not what a third party owns. And I think that's part of
the focus as we move forward. We need to own our customer experiences. We need to own our employee
experiences and a lot that is driving what the technology initiatives are across the organization.
But if you were to go on to Valley Direct today, you would find an experience, I think, many would really enjoy
three minutes plus or minus to open up an account and onboard it as well here, which is something that we think
is leading and will helpfully drive multitude of efficiencies across the entire organization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Last one for me is on the allowance. You mentioned in the release that there are increases in the
allowance across most of your loan categories including commercial real estate up 5 basis points due to higher
quantitative reserves. Could you just flesh it out a little bit more what happened there and are you preparing for
any sort of increase or change in the level of charge-offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So within the model the most sensitive attribute would be the loss rates. And those did not materially change. So
the biggest change from a dollar perspective was the fact that we had significant loan growth. When you combine
that with an improving economic scenario that I talked about in my prepared remarks from Moody's, you get a
slightly lower required allowance. And that's why you see the minor 3 basis point tick down in our allowance
coverage ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. That's all I had. Thank you for taking my questions.
