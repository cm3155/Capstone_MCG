Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
This morning, Old National reported its first quarter 2024 results. Our peer-leading, low cost deposit franchise,
above average deposit loan growth, disciplined expense control and stable credit performance during the quarter
drove these better-than-consensus results and sets us up favorably as we move into the second quarter.
Before I delve into the first quarter highlights, I want to underscore the strategic importance of our partnership with
Nashville-based CapStar Bank, which we closed on April 1. Not only has this partnership expanded our franchise
to robust and dynamic southeastern markets, but it also accelerates our growth potential. It's a milestone that
officially welcomes CapStar clients and team members to our Old National family. CapStar Bank will operate as a
division of Old National Bank until the banking center and systems conversions, which we anticipate will occur in
the third quarter.
Let's focus on our first quarter earnings starting on page 4, which have laid a strong foundation for the year. We
reported GAAP earnings of $0.40 per common share for the first quarter and our adjusted EPS was $0.45.
Notably, our adjusted earnings per share exceeded consensus estimates by 5%. This accomplishment was driven
by above average deposit loan growth, stable credit performance and importantly disciplined expense
management, which underscores our financial strength and consistent quality returns. Our adjusted ROATCE for
the quarter was 16.7% and our adjusted ROA was 1.1%. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 53.4%, despite
the challenging interest rate environment.
Total deposit growth was 5% annualized during the quarter, despite seasonal outflows by businesses and public
sector clients. Loan growth was 7.5% annualized. Our total cost of deposits for the quarter remains at a low 201
basis points. Year-over-year, we saw total deposit growth of 8% and total loan growth of 6%. Meanwhile, our
tangible common book value grew 2% during the first quarter and 11% year-over-year. Our year-over-year trends
once again demonstrate our consistent financial strength and quality returns.
In summary, our first quarter results have set a solid foundation for 2024. Our strong deposit loan growth, stable
credit performance and effective expense management demonstrate our ability to excel in a challenging banking
environment. As we progress into the year, we reiterate our steadfast commitment to sustainable growth,
disciplined expense management and strategic talent acquisition. We are confident in our ability to navigate the
market and deliver strong results.
Before turning the call over to John Moran, I'd like to briefly address our Chief Financial Officer position. As you
might expect, we will not comment today and I will refer you to the 8-K that we filed on April 1. We will provide any
updates in the future when appropriate. That said we are focused on running our business as usual. As I said
earlier in this call, we had a great first quarter and look forward to another strong year. We already have an
exceptionally talented finance, accounting and treasury team in place. For example, [ph] Mike Lloyd (00:04:52),
our Treasurer; Angela Putnam, our Chief Accounting Officer, who are both on the call with us today, are very
seasoned and each has 10 years plus experience with us.
John Moran, we already know from his tenure with us and as a Wall Street analyst covering banks like Old
National has seamlessly taken on the Interim Chief Financial Officer role. In addition, John has been a CFO at a
publicly traded bank holding company. He also was identified as a primary successor during our succession
planning process. I have complete confidence in John and the entire team.
I'm also pleased to introduce Carrie Goldfeder, our new Chief Credit Officer, who will join us on our quarterly calls
from now on. Carrie, who came to us from Capital One and previously worked at GE Capital, brings our
leadership team a wealth of experience and expertise. Despite her relatively short tenure with us, she is already

making a significant impact. Her addition to our leadership team further strengthens our commitment to
excellence in all aspects of our operations.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John.

John V. Moran, IV
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 5, you can see our first quarter balance sheet, which highlights stability in our
liquidity and capital positions. Our first quarter deposit growth has again allowed us to organically fund loan
growth while holding our borrowings and brokered deposits consistent. Over the last year, we have grown
deposits 8%, 200 basis points faster than our 6% year-over-year loan growth, while increasing tangible book
value by 11%. We ended the quarter with a strong CET1 ratio of 10.76% and we continue to expect that we will
accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of a better-than-peer return profile and a
targeted 30% dividend payout ratio. Our liquidity and capital levels continue to provide a strong foundation, which
positions us well into 2024.
On slide 6, we show the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew 7.5% annualized from last
quarter, slightly above our expectations. We remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet
our risk adjusted return requirements. New loan production rates in the high 7% range and marginal funding costs
in the low 4% range support our expectation that net interest income has bottomed out in the first quarter. The
investment portfolio increased very modestly in the quarter due to reinvestment of cash flows, partly offset by
changes in fair values and the duration was effectively unchanged. As we have mentioned in past calls, new
money yields are running 200 basis points above back book yields and we have approximately $1.3 billion in cash
flows expected over the next 12 months.
Moving to slide 7, we show our trend in total deposits, which grew 5% annualized from 4Q, despite normal
seasonal outflows in public funds and business noninterest-bearing. Our broker deposits, as a percentage of total
deposits, is now 3.2%, which remains well below peers. [ph] Deposits (00:07:55) grew in both retail and
commercial and new checking account production remained strong. We did experience upward pressure on
deposit rates over the course of the quarter as we remained focused on better-than-industry growth in our deposit
base. That said, we did see a marked deceleration in deposit costs later in the quarter, with total deposit costs for
the month of March at 205 basis points, only 4 basis points higher than our 1Q average and a spot rate at March
31 that was down a few basis points from there. As a reminder, the addition of CapStar is expected to increase
our total deposit costs by approximately 5 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, we remain very pleased
with the execution of our deposit strategy, which continues to drive above peer deposit growth at below peer
costs.
Slide 8 provides our quarter-end income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common shares
of $116 million or $0.40 per share. Reported earnings include the following pre-tax items, a $13 million non-cash
expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy First Midwest
plan; an additional $3 million charge related to the FDIC special assessment; and $3 million in merger-related
charges. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.45.
Moving on to slide 9, we present details of our net interest income and margin. As expected, deposit repricing led
to modest declines in both net interest income and margin that were in line with our guidance. Our low total
deposit cost of 201 basis points remains a key competitive advantage. Again, we have put up better deposit
growth at a lower cost than most banks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $78 million for the quarter. Our primary fee
businesses performed generally in line with expectations with seasonally lower bank fees.
Continuing to slide 11, we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which were favorable to our guidance
due to better occupancy costs, a result of a mild winter for the Upper Midwest, lower tax credit amortization and
lower professional fees, along with lower various sundry other expenses.
On slide 12, we present our credit trends, which remain stable, reflecting the quality of both our commercial and
consumer portfolios. The delinquency ratio declined slightly and the rise in nonperforming loans stems from the
migration of three credits. Migration into adverse categories has slowed from prior quarters and, as is historically
been the case, we maintain a proactive approach to grading and resolution. Total net charge-offs were a low 14
basis points and were split evenly between PCD and non-PCD loans. Our first quarter allowance, including
reserve for unfunded commitments, was unchanged at 103 basis points. There were no material changes to our
model assumptions and the weighting on the Moody's S-3 scenario remains 100%.
On slide 13, we review our capital position at the end of the quarter. Improvements were seen in all regulatory
capital ratios, with the move in rates muting the impact of strong retained earnings on our TCE built.
Slide 14 includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance. NII is expected to
increase in the second quarter with the inclusion of CapStar and then continue to modestly increase in the back
half of the year. Our assumptions are listed on the slide, but I would highlight a few of the primary drivers. First,
we assumed three rate cuts of 25 basis points each, consistent with the [indiscernible] (00:11:31). Second, we are
anticipating additional late cycle deposit repricing that will result in a terminal beta of 40% by midyear and a
noninterest-bearing deposit mix that falls to 23% by year-end. Lastly, we assume the final CapStar acquisition
accounting marks are consistent with those used at deal announcement. We believe we have positioned the
balance sheet well as we approach the end of this rate cycle, with the work to achieve a neutral rate risk position
behind us. Also, closing CapStar a quarter early modestly helped our neutrality.
In addition to the three rate cut scenario, we did run a forward curve, including one-and-a-half rate cuts and a
static curve through our models. The results of each were not materially different from our three rate cut scenario,
again suggesting that we have effectively managed the balance sheet to neutral.
Slide 15 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items for the second quarter and full year 2024. All
guidance has been updated to include the CapStar close on April 1 purchase accounting assumptions in line with
our transaction modeling, which is subject to change as we finalize these initial adjustments in the second quarter.
As you can see, our guidance is unchanged.
In summary, we had a strong start to 2024 with the first quarter results better than our expectations and strong
performance metrics. More importantly, we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic
priorities. First, we are organically funding our loan growth, with deposits up 8% year-over-year, 200 basis points
better than our loan growth. Second, our adjusted return profile remains top quartile against peers at nearly 17%
on tangible common equity. Third, we remain disciplined on operating expenses with an adjusted efficiency ratio
of 53%. Fourth, we have a clean credit book with non-PCD net charge-offs of just 7 basis points. And finally, we
are continuing to rapidly compound tangible book value per share, which was up 11% year-over-year.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. And we do have the full team available,
including Mark Sander and Jim Sandgren.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
[indiscernible] (00:13:58)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. I was hoping first maybe we could discuss some of those deposit pricing metrics, John, that you mentioned,
sort of the late first quarter and then the spot rates as well. Just maybe overall competitive dynamics, what's kind
of giving you comfort that it sounds like in places you are able to lower rates exactly? Just maybe overall
competitive and – and thoughts on your own positioning as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Look, I'd say it's still a competitive deposit environment out there. We are on offense and we
are unapologetic about that. I mean as long as we can continue to put on good business at incremental margins
that makes sense we will continue to be focused on growing our deposits. We did see costs start to abate late in
the quarter, right. And that's what I was trying to getting at with the 205 basis points in March, which was only 4
basis points higher than average and our spot rate at March 31 was actually a couple of basis points below that.
So, knock on wood hopefully a little bit less competitive, but we are still on offense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thanks, John. And then I was hoping you could also touch on loan growth a little. You know I'd say
your growth seems to be holding in better than what we are seeing for most peers this quarter. So, just maybe
some thoughts on demand, overall customer behavior, if you sort of seeing demand accelerate, decelerate, stay
the same, just maybe overall dynamics please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Scott, it's Mark. Yeah, loan growth came in a little bit above what we expected in Q1, but just a little bit
above. And I would say C&I clients are still in a solid position and you're seeing decent demand out there. So,
we're not looking for anything robust, but I think we can slightly outgrow the industry, which is what we've put out
there. We also had the benefit of some tailwinds from our construction book that funded this quarter and will for
the next couple of quarters, so that probably was about half of our [ph] loans (00:15:48).

Good morning, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I just want to touch base on the growth engine. I get that you guys don't move your credit box, you have the
market kind of comes in kind of where your time to shine is. Is there anything that can be done to potentially
exceed the growth guidance you had? I mean, from here, I completely understand you are not changing credit,
but like if the market offers because competitors are in the market as much, are you seeing risk adjusted yields,
would you be able to grow loans faster than deposits or have the appetite to do so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
You know we will continue to have the appetite to grow good, profitable, long-term relationships and we are very
much open for business. And so I'd say, to answer your question is more dependent to some degree on what –
how other competitors, if they have that same kind of view. You know some people are a little more closed I
would suggest than we are. So, I think it's possible, but we're – our 5% to 7% organic growth is a little bit above
what we think the industry average will be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Ben, I would just add we are going to continue to take advantage of the new talent we have acquired. You know
some of them are new markets and some of them are existing markets, but each one of them are varying degrees
of being onboarded and running through any obligations they have. So, I think there is great opportunity for us to
get traction there. And then add on, the closing of our partnership in Tennessee, we think that just offers great
opportunities to accelerate their growth, our growth in that marketplace. Obviously, we have got through some
systems conversions and things to get through. But the back half of the year really should be getting after it and
we're looking to have great growth coming out of Tennessee and Asheville.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. And the other question I had would be more on this high level on credit. You guys have always done a
great job, that's where you hang your hat, to be honest. But thinking about just credit across your footprint, are
7

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
there any geographies which are experiencing, for lack of a better word, frothy pricing in maybe commercial real
estate or just are you in pencils down mode as any CRE-type lending products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
No, we are not pencil down, Ben, in any products. Obviously, with the rate environment right now, the numbers
just don't work for the same level of – at the same level that they used to. So, CRE volume across our footprint is
down just by market dynamics, not because we have changed our underwriting. We are still selectively adding
new clients in CRE as well. But certainly more of the growth is going to come in C&I where we think we are really
well positioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
You know I would just add, Ben, to that, that comes with full pricing, full relationships as usual, obviously that
discipline has been an important part of how we've been successful. But it's ever so more present today that we
need to ensure that we get our terms. And in our terms, we'll continue to – to take advantage of every opportunity
that comes our way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
And with that same underwriting, our terms requires more equity.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I maybe start with slide 17. Could you just expand on the comments manageable volume of loans subject to
refinance risk? I'm guessing a part of it is multifamily. And it maybe while you're at it, if you could comment on
multifamily trends that you're seeing in your markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
So I'll start, Terry, It's Mark. As we say, most manageable level that's based on the data that we provided there,
we have $2.8 billion coming due in the next 18 months. When we underwrite, we stress everything at a 300 basis
point cushion. So, that's why we show above 4% and less than 4%. So, we have $400 million of loans maturing in
the next 18 months that would bump up against our underwriting parameters. I would say of that $400 million, less
than half of it is what we really have a keen eye on that – that might have some stress. So, that's why $100
million, you know less than $200 million on our portfolio we think is very manageable, I guess is the comment
there.
To your question on multifamily and multifamily in our markets is holding up really well. You know I don't know
how to describe it better than that. We didn't have the highs that some of the coasts perhaps had. And so you're
still seeing rent growth. It's modest rent growth, but it's after many years of really strong rent growth that has more
than accounted for the increase in expenses that's happened over those years. So, we feel really good about our
multifamily portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow-up question on security yields, they were up a 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter.
The portfolio was up and new money yields were 5.61%. So I guess what was – what's behind just the slight
increase in security yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. The more modest increase was really a chunk of very short-term US Treasuries that matured in the
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And just last quick one, the NII bottoming out in the first quarter, John. Is that with and without CapStar? I just
want to make sure I understand that statement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A

Yes.

Hey, good morning. Where are you guys finding opportunities to grow deposit balances and relationships? Can
you touch on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
You know, in our – in every one of our lines of business. So, in our consumer business, their primary objectives
and goals is active checking accounts. And so it is literally gaining market share one by one on a daily basis. And
seeing that new accounts opened exceeding what runs out the door. In commercial, as we said earlier, just we
are still very much open for business, so that's when your whole focus is on long-term relationships that require
the deposit balances to come with it, it partially self-funds itself. And then our private banking team and wealth
has done a really nice job with our money market promotions, getting out there – getting after it, I guess, nothing
more than good old fashioned blocking and tackling with a really good team.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Jon, I would just add, starting in the fall of 2022, I personally was around the entire company pounding on the
table saying, we're all deposit gatherers and I don't care whether you're faced off with clients or you're in treasury
or you're in marketing, we are all deposit gatherers and that's been the mantra, which is I think helped drive our
success.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Fair enough. And then on noninterest-bearing, I know there's some seasonal factors in there, but
does it feel like that has bottomed or is close to a bottom that $9 billion and change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Jon, I feel like we are getting close. It's probably a little early to call the bottom, but what we saw this
quarter was January was – saw outflows, some of that is seasonal. February we saw stability and we actually
started to grow in March. So, we feel good about the guidance that we have got out there. We do think it'll
continue to kind of come down a little bit, but not much from here.

Okay, good. And then just one more on credit. Thank you for the provision guide, I think that helps. But how do
you guys expect the NPL balances to progress throughout the year? Is it safe to assume they are going to
continue to go up or is that the wrong read on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I wouldn't assume that, Jon. You know as things – as we work things through the pipe, we are certainly looking to
move things out of NPAs as well, and will I think so. It's hard to always to predict when someone isn't going to pay
you.

But I think we are well ahead of that view, if you can as much as you can with our quarterly problem asset
reviews. So, yeah, I wouldn't necessarily assume it's going to go up from here, but certainly some of the criticized
and classifieds will work their way through the pipe over these next 12 months to 18 months.

John V. Moran, IV A
Executive Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. You know Chris, I'd say the biggest risk is probably just what happens in terms of noninterest-bearing. And
again we feel pretty good that we're bottoming out there based on the trends that we saw in the quarter. But that
would be the biggest downside risk. I think biggest upside risk might be for us on the fee line. You know I think
capital markets was a touch soft this quarter, a few swaps one way or another can make a difference there. And
it's hard to kind of get really too excited about mortgage, but pipelines, they're up pretty, pretty solidly, so maybe
we'll have a nice spring selling season here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe, Jim, on thoughts on just capital return once you get through the integration, any
thoughts...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
...on buyback later in the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Great, great question and certainly a topic of conversation around here. I think you are right, I think we are
focused on getting through the integration of CapStar, kind of getting a better read on what we think the balance
of the year looks like. And then as we get in to the back half of the year, I think that could be something that's a
serious part of our conversation. You know unchecked capital grows pretty quickly and so I think there will be
opportunities to think about capital a little differently than we have in the last couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe final one on a lot of discussion from your peers about derisking. You guys don't have the
concentrations. Is there anything in the portfolio that might be – being considered to accelerate, just move on and
kind of derisk while you could?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
From a high level, from my perspective, there's nothing that we need to do different in our portfolio management.
Obviously, it's a constant source of conversation around optimization, but usually it means slowing things down,
turning things up than it is about moving assets off the balance sheet. So, while there's always, always ongoing
portfolio management discipline around that, on the margin, we'll continue to have conversations around asset
classes. We think we can get the best return for our capital allocation and we will make those decisions, but they
will have a de minimis effect quarter in, quarter out.

Operator: Our next question comes from David Long from Raymond James. Your line is now open.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
The – wanted to talk about the nonperformer – nonperforming loan line, you were up about 20% in the quarter. I
think someone mentioned that maybe there is a few credits involved there. But specifically, what's – what
happened there in the nonperforming loan line and to drive it up 20% in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander Q
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. David, it's Mark. I think it's just the ebb and flow, the natural ebb and flow of credit. You know it was three
credits that drove it. The largest was a multifamily property that I'm not worried about candidly at all. I don't think
there's a risk of loss there. And then we had two C&I credits that were not related, not symptomatic of any
broader, broader concern, so just episodic three credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you, Mark. And then operating expenses seemed very well managed in the quarter. I know you have
CapStar coming on here, but ex-CapStar, what's going on just with the core operating expenses? It seemed
better than expected. Were there any – you highlighted a few items that we took out. Anything else in the quarter
that was maybe nonrecurring or expenses that maybe you missed out on this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
No, I wouldn't characterize anything as nonrecurring in there other than what we had called out separately. It was
as you know sitting in Chicago, a milder winter. We moved less snow around this winter, that helped. I mean
there's sort of six or seven good guys in there that I would just kind of caution, don't take 1Q and run rate it and
add CapStar on to it. I think we have a little bit of lift here in the second quarter and that's reflected in the
guidance.
