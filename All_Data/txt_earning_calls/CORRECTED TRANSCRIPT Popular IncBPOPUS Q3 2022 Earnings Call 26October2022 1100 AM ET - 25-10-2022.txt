Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Our results for the quarter were solid and reflect the strength of
economic activity in our markets, our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk management.
In the third quarter, we achieved net income of $422 million or $196 million excluding the impact of the Evertec
Transactions. At the beginning of the quarter, we closed the previously announced agreement with Evertec to
acquire key customer-facing channels and to extend important commercial agreements. This transaction is
already allowing us to accelerate our ongoing digital and business transformation as we focus on the changing
needs and expectations of our clients and enhancing the omni-channel experience that we provide.
Please turn to slide 3. Our quarterly net income, excluding the impact of the Evertec transactions, was $16 million
lower than the second quarter. Third quarter results were characterized by positive variances in net interest
income and fee income, offset by higher provision for credit losses and operating expenses. The adjusted results
for the quarter do not include any equity pickup from our prior investment in Evertec.
During the quarter, loan growth was strong and broad-based, both geographically and across all loan segments.
Total loan balances grew by $1.2 billion, commercial loan growth in Puerto Rico was particularly healthy during
the period. Our net interest margin improved in the quarter. However, we have begun to see a higher cost of
deposits, particularly in our Puerto Rico public deposit portfolio in the Popular Bank. Credit quality trends remain
favorable during the period. NPLs decreased in the quarter. And NCOs are significantly below pre-pandemic
levels.
In the third quarter, we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In July, we completed the previously
announced $400 million accelerated share repurchase program. Also, upon completion of the sale of our Evertec
shares in August, we entered an additional of $231 million ASR which we expect to complete before the end of
the year.
In light of the rapid increase in interest rate year-to-date, as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates going
forward, in October, we transferred $6.5 billion in intermediate term US Treasury from available-for-sale to held-
to-maturity. This reduces the impact of OCI on tangible capital from future interest rate fluctuations. The securities
at an accumulated pre-tax loss of $873 million.
Please turn to slide 4. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by approximately 8,000 in the third quarter to reach
1.97 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong.
Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded $1.1 million or 56% of our customer base. Additionally, we
continue to capture nearly two-thirds of our deposits through digital channels.
This trend remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and well above our island peers. Commercial
loan growth was strong. Commercial loan balances of BPPR and Popular Bank increased by $489 million and
$332 million respectively. Auto loan and lease balances at BPPR increased by $97 million or 2% versus the
second quarter. The dollar value of credit and debit card sales of our customers remain stable during the quarter
and were 1% above the third quarter in 2021.
As on the mainland, mortgage originations in Puerto Rico have been impacted by rising rates and limited
inventory of available properties. The dollar value of mortgage originations at BPPR decreased by 36% compared
to the third quarter of last year.
In September, Puerto Rico and Florida were impacted by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian, respectively. Hurricane Fiona
caused a complete blackout on the island and considerable damages to certain sectors in the southwest region.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
While the impact to our operation was not material, some customers concentrated in flood prone communities
were significantly impacted by the disaster. Hurricane Ian did not have a significant impact on our operations.
We have offered various forms of assistance to our customers in both regions. This includes waiving late payment
fees on certain products, and waiving ATM withdrawal fees for using ATMs outside of our network. Additionally,
we have offered a moratorium to eligible borrowers impacted by the storms.
We are still evaluating the impact of Hurricane Fiona and Ian; however, given the low level of assistance request
received to-date, the effect on credit risk should not be significant. That said, we will continue to work with our
customers that were impacted by these events.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macro environment in Puerto Rico. The local economy
continued to perform well during the third quarter. Business activity has remained solid. However, certain metrics
suggested economic trends in Puerto Rico, while still positive, may be moderating somewhat. The Puerto Rico
Economic Activity Index for August, which is the most recently released data, it's 1.5% higher than August 2021
and continues to exceed pre-pandemic levels.
We remain encouraged by solid employment levels. In September, total non-farm employment in Puerto Rico
increased slightly from its level in June. The August 2022 employment rate of 5.8% is the lowest ever. New auto
sales decreased by 11% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2021, but remained above pre-
pandemic levels. The auto industry was disrupted in September by Hurricane Fiona and continues to be affected
by supply chain-related product shortages. Despite these challenges, there continues to be a robust demand for
cars in Puerto Rico.
The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy, as Puerto Rico is a
popular destination for mainland residents. Airport traffic has remained robust. Year-to-date to September, total
passenger traffic has increased by 8% compared to 2021. Hotel demand has also remained strong. Occupancy
rates are up 10% year-to-date, and the average daily room rate continues to compare favorably to historical
levels. In short, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter, particularly the strong loan growth.
We are mindful of the global economic uncertainty and market volatility but remain optimistic about the future of
Puerto Rico, our primary market, and our ability to manage through any potential challenges that may lie ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release details various sets from the second quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $422 million. Early in Q3, we completed the previously announced agreement with
Evertec. In August, the corporation completed the sale of its remaining 7.1 million shares of Evertec common
stock. These transactions resulted in an aggregate after-tax gain of $227 million. Excluding these Evertec
Transactions, Q3 net income would have been $196 million.
Net interest income for the third quarter was $580 million, an increase of $46 million from Q2. The variance was
driven by higher yield of investment securities as well as higher income from loan growth at both banks. This was
4

somewhat offset by higher interest expense on deposits resulting from increased interest rates, mainly from
Puerto Rico government deposits and, to a lesser extent, Popular Bank.
Non-interest income increased by $269 million to $426 million. Excluding the $558 million pre-tax gain from the
Evertec Transactions, net interest income for the quarter was $168 million. The remaining $11 million variance in
noninterest income during the quarter resulted from an increase of $9.2 million due to the reversal of a contingent
consideration related to the purchase price adjustments for last year's acquisition of our US Equipment Finance
business.
During the quarter, we also took a charge of $9 million for goodwill impairment on the transaction, eliminating the
benefit of this reversal. We also recorded an increase in other service fees due to higher insurance fees and
higher merchant acquiring fees, the latter related to the revenue sharing agreement with Evertec. These were
partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking income due to the runoff of the servicing portfolio and higher
losses on closed derivative positions, and lower deposit service charges primarily due to the corporation's
initiative to eliminate or modify account overdraft fees.
We expect noninterest income to be approximately $150 million in Q2. The reduction from our $155 million to
$160 million prior run rate is partly due to three factors that will also have an effect on our 2023 run rate.
First, reduced earnings from our portfolio of investments held under the equity method related to the sale of our
ownership stake in Evertec. Second, lower deposit service charges stemming from the elimination of account
overdraft fees and modification-related policies and higher earnings credit rate on corporate cash management
service. Lastly, in August, we decided to retain in portfolio FHA insured mortgage originations rather than sell
them as we have done in the past. As a result, our mortgage [ph] gained wholesale (00:12:00) fees will be lower,
but our tax exempt interest income will be higher. In our January webcast, we'll provide updated 2023 guidance
for quarterly non-interest income.
The provision for credit losses for the third quarter was $40 million compared to $9 million in the second quarter.
Total operating expenses were $476 million in the quarter, an increase of $70 million from Q2. This included $17
million expenses tied to the transaction with Evertec and the previously mentioned $9 million goodwill impairment
charge related to last year's acquisition of our US Equipment Finance business.
Personnel costs were $25 million higher, mostly as a result of the previously discussed market and merit salary
adjustments that were effective in July. This was a concerted effort to enhance our ability to attract and retain
talent. Credit and debit card processing expenses increased by $3 million due to lower card network incentives,
and OREO income decreased by $5 million due to lower gain on sale of properties.
Excluding the impact of the Evertec expenses and the goodwill impairment charge, expenses in Q3 would have
been approximately $450 million versus our prior guidance of $445 million. In Q4, we expect expenses of $450
million. We anticipate that expenses in 2023 will be higher than our quarterly run rate, driven by continuing
increases in personnel, technology, digital transformation, consulting and compliance costs. Our effective tax rate
for the quarter was 14% compared to 23% in the second quarter. This decrease was mainly a result of the
Evertec Transactions which are subject to a preferential tax rate. The full year 2022 effective tax rate guidance
remains unchanged at 17% to 20%.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest income on taxable equivalent basis was $647 million, $51 million higher than in
the second quarter. Net interest margin increased by 23 basis points to 3.32% in Q3. On a taxable equivalent
basis, NIM was 3.71%, an increase of 26 basis points. The increase is driven by a higher interest rate

environment, improved asset mix, a 25 basis points increase in loan yields, and the lag in repricing for
government deposits. Excluding Puerto Rico public deposit, deposit balances declined by $900 million in the
quarter, mainly from deposits managed through trust division.
As of the end of the third quarter, other deposits were roughly $17.5 billion, an increase of $400 million from Q2.
However, in the first week in October, the Puerto Rico government transferred approximately $1.4 billion from the
bank to fund pension obligations as part of the plan of adjustment. Currently, Puerto Rico public deposits at BPPR
total approximately $15.8 billion.
We expect public deposits will end 2022 between $13 and $15 billion, slightly higher than our previous range. Our
ending loan balances increased by $1.2 billion or 4% compared to Q2 and are up $2.3 billion or 8% year-to-date.
All loan segments were higher in the quarter with commercial loan growth being particularly strong.
During the quarter, we shifted $3.4 billion of liquidity from Fed funds to T-bills that currently provide a higher tax
effective yield. We are encouraged by the demand for credit at BPPR and PB. We will continue to take advantage
of opportunities to extend and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity.
Please turn to slide 8. Year-to-date, our retail and commercial deposit franchise in Puerto Rico has continued to
track below its historical beta, but these deposits now represent a lower portion of total deposits compared to the
last rate cycle. As we discussed last quarter, during the rapid shift to higher short-term interest rates, going
forward, the cost of public sector deposits, which account for approximately 27% of our total deposits, will now
move in tandem with market rates albeit with a quarter lag.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the cost of public deposits to be 150 basis points higher. As a result of the
increase in public sector deposit cost, we expect our reported margin to decrease in Q4 before resuming a
positive trend in 2023.
Our interest rate sensitivity will be relatively neutral to rising rate scenarios in the coming quarters. The majority of
the increase in deposit cost is driven by public deposits in Puerto Rico and to a lesser extent, Popular Bank and
commercial excess cash accounts at BPPR. We will continue to actively manage commercial deposit costs,
taking into consideration the total relationship with the client.
Please turn to slide 9. We have seen a decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio that is temporary. Our
investment portfolio is basically comprised of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, which carry
minimal credit risk. The bond portfolio has an average duration of approximately 3.2 years. As the positions roll
down the yield curve, their fair value will converge to par and they mark will go down to zero.
Given the rapid increase in interest rates year-to-date, as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates going
forward, in October, we transferred $6.5 billion of US Treasuries in the four- to six-year maturity range from
available for sale to held-to-maturity, thereby, reducing the forward-looking impact of AOCI on tangible book
value. This action reduced AOCI exposure to interest rates by about one-third.
At the time of the transfer, this position had recorded in OCI a pre-tax unrealized loss of $873 million, which will
effectively be amortized back into capital through the remaining life of the transfer positions at a rate of
approximately $40 million per quarter through 2026, then tapering off until final maturity.
The yield on transfer securities remains the same and no losses recognized as a result of this move. This transfer
does not have a material effect on our liquidity. We continue to maintain a large available for sale portfolio in short

term treasuries and cash [ph] at the Fed (00:19:15). While the changes in the amount of unrealized gains and
losses in AOCI have an impact on the corporation's tangible capital ratios as well as those of the wholly-owned
bank and subsidiary, they do not impact regulatory capital ratios.
Please turn to slide 10. Our return on tangible equity was 31.9% in the quarter, benefiting from the gain in the
Evertec Transactions. Regulatory capital levels remain strong. Our Common Equity Tier 1 in Q3 was 16%, down
35 basis points from Q2. In July, we completed the previously announced $400 million ASR. In total, we
repurchased 5.1 million shares at an average purchase price of $78.94. In August, we entered into another ASR
agreement to repurchase an aggregate of 231 million of Popular's common stock. The full impact is already
reflected in our capital balance. The combined effect of the ASRs during the year increased our EPS in Q3 by
$0.41 per share.
Tangible book value at quarter end was $38.69 per share, a 16% decrease driven mostly by higher accumulated
unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale of $782 million, a result of higher interest rates, and the
impact of the ASR, and the dividends during the quarter. These were partially offset by the quarterly net income.
Given the uncertainty in markets including the volatility in interest rates which impact our tangible capital levels,
we have decided to temporarily delay additional stock repurchase activity beyond the current ASR. We will
maintain the current level of dividend and plan to revisit future capital actions in the second half of 2023 once we
have more certainty around the outlook for interest rates and the economy. As a result, we do not intend to
announce new capital actions in January webcast.
Our [ph] perspective in (00:21:30) capital return has not changed, anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios.
Over time, we expect our regulatory capital ratios to move towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer
to account for our geographic concentration in Puerto Rico.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continue to exhibit stable credit quality trends with low
levels of net charge-offs and increasing nonperforming loans. We continue to closely monitor changes in borrower
performance and the macroeconomic environment given potential economic headwinds, rising interest rates and
geopolitical uncertainty. However, we believe that the improvement in the risk profile of the corporation's loan
portfolios positions Popular to operate successfully on the more difficult economic conditions.
The impact of Hurricane Fiona and Ian is still being evaluated. But given the Hurricane's limited impact in the
markets we do business and the low levels of assistance requests received to-date, the [ph] effect on (00:22:41)
credit risk should not be significant.
Turning to slide number 11, nonperforming assets decreased by $23 million to $547 million this quarter driven by
an NPL decrease of $25 million. The decrease in NPLs was mainly in Puerto Rico driven by lower mortgage NPLs
by $32 million and lower commercial NPLs by $9 million, in part offset by higher order NPLs by $6 million. The
increase in auto NPLs was due in part to Hurricane Fiona as we stopped collection activity during the last two
weeks of the quarter.
In the US, NPLs increased by $10 million mainly due to an $11 million healthcare relationship that was placed in
nonaccrual status during the quarter. Compared to the second quarter, NPL inflows, excluding consumer loan
7

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
increased by $6 million, driven by the US healthcare relationship previously mentioned, offset in part by lower
mortgage inflows in Puerto Rico. At the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPL to total loans held-in-portfolio was
1.4% compared to 1.6% in the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 12. Net charge-offs amounted to $18 million or an annualized 24 basis points of average
loans held-in-portfolio compared to $6 million or 8 basis points in the prior quarter. The results for the quarter
were impacted by a $5 million charge-off of a pharmaceutical manufacturing relationship and by the lack of
collection activities in Puerto Rico during the last two weeks of September.
The corporation allowance for credit losses increased by $21 million or 3.1% to $703 million, driven by higher loan
volumes, changes in credit quality, and an $8 million in specific reserve recorded for the previously mentioned
healthcare commercial NPL inflow. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio remained flat
at 2.23%. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPL's held-in-portfolio was 155% compared to 143% in the
prior quarter.
The provision for credit losses was an expense of $40 million compared to $10 million in the previous quarter,
reflecting the changes in the allowance for credit losses and the net charge-off activity. In Puerto Rico, the
provision for credit losses was $29 million compared to $9 million in the prior quarter, while in the US, the
provision was $11 million compared to $1 million.
Please turn to slide number 13. As discussed in prior webcasts, we leverage Moody's Analytics for the US and
Puerto Rico economic forecast. Notwithstanding persistent high inflation, increases in interest rate, supply chain
constraints, and general uncertainty, Moody's Analytics' near-term baseline outlook remains for the US economy
to continue recession-free. Our framework assigns the highest probability to the baseline scenario followed
closely by the more pessimistic recession scenario, S3. The quarter-over-quarter change in ACL was driven by
loan portfolio growth and increases in specific reserves, offset in part by continued strength in Puerto Rico
employment forecast and changes to the period Popular utilizes to revert its macroeconomic forecast to historical
levels.
To summarize, our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality metrics in the third quarter with low net
charge-offs and decreasing non-performing loans. We remain attentive to the evolving environment but believe
that improvements over time in the risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolio positions Popular to operate
successfully under more difficult economic conditions.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date have been strong,
driven by solid earnings, robust loan growth, stable credit quality, and continued customer growth. We're aware of
potential challenges stemming from inflation, higher interest rates, and market volatility, yet remain optimistic
about opportunities in Puerto Rico, our main market.
Consumer activity continues at healthy levels, and recovery funds from previous events are expected to provide
additional stimulus. With strong fundamentals, prudent management and diversified sources of revenue, we are
well positioned to leverage these opportunities and address any potential challenges that may arise. In addition to
our financial results, I'm extremely proud about our team's response in the wake of Hurricane Fiona. Thanks to
their agility and resolve, we mobilized quickly to assist communities in need, serve our customers despite

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First, I wanted to ask about your comments on the delaying of the capital actions until the second half of 2023. I'm
just curious if the whole exercise you go through with the Fed that I think was supposed to take place around this
time, if the whole exercise gets delayed by six months or if you're ongoing that right now. And kind of have to go
through the plans and then you just won't announce anything until the second half of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. No. The normal process we go through with the Fed is completed. We have completed our stress test and
everything else. So – the biggest part of that process. So, that is done. It is convenient when we talk about our
capital actions close to finishing the discussions because it's the freshest stress test. So, I think there's a
reasonable chance to – we talk to them about it in the second quarter. They'll ask us to refresh it or something like
that, but maybe not. You never know. The one we continue already maybe good enough. We respond normally to
updates request from the Fed. This will be no different.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just as it relates to the timing of the transfer from AFS to HTM, is that correlated to completing the
stress test? And as you think about TCE historically, it hasn't really mattered and maybe it still doesn't given the
amount of regulatory capital you have, but I'm just wondering if there's kind of a floor that either you have
internally or that the Fed has suggested upon you that we should be aware of.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. It is not correlated at all. It was a separate decision as we are working through it to get implemented. We
ended up implementing what we did, which was the beginning of the fourth quarter. It's not correlated whatsoever
and we have not received any comments from the Fed on tangible capital whatsoever.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then Carlos, I just wondered if you could clarify the guidance on expenses. I think you
said $450 million for the fourth quarter, and then 2023 should be a higher than the quarterly run rate. Is that the
average quarterly run rate for 2022 that it should be higher then? Is it the back two quarters? How does the profit
sharing, whether we get it or not, factor into that guidance just so we're all on the same page and there's no big
surprises in the second half of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. What I said is higher than our current run rate. So, it's not the average priority for the year with our current run
rate, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So the average starting point should be around $450 million, you're going up from there and then a profit
sharing comes in the second half of next year. Then, that will be added on to that current run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, profit sharing as you know, we have to outperform our budget for that to kick in. So, that normally
doesn't happen until – in the latter part of the year, the only difference this year is that it was reasonably clear we
were going to outperform earlier in the year, and that's why we spoke about it in the second quarter, typically in
the fourth. But again, it is a program that is intended to share outperformance. So, we always hope we get there
because that means everybody is doing better, including our shareholders. But that is not part of the
[indiscernible] (00:32:27), no.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question is around net interest margin maybe for Carlos and your commentary that will
decline in the fourth quarter and then should trend higher in 2023, how should we be thinking about the
government deposits, repricing post the last rate hike? Is it going to be the same 90-day lag for one quarter out,
10

that will kind of stabilizes or just given the larger balances there and the more turnover it might take a couple of
more quarters. It just seems like it's going to be hard for NIM to outperform while that book catches up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I mean, it's not exactly 90 days. It was pretty close to 90 days. And as you can see from our commentary for next
quarter, the increase in Fed rate business in the third quarter was $150 million. So, that's what we expect the
increase in government deposit to go up next quarter. So, conceptually, if the increase in the fourth quarter is
$125 million, then that would carry over to the first quarter of next year and so on and so forth. Then the lag, the
benefit this quarter, we had talked about the lag helping as rates start to go up. But then as long as the rate of
increases is constant, it will just catch up one quarter later.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, one quarter following the last rate hike, that's a kind of [ph] flesh (00:34:12) through the system? Got it.
And then that $17.5 billion in public funds, is that an average number or is that end of period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
That's end of period. And again as of now, the number is $15.8 billion. So, it's already down from that end of
quarter number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And maybe you can provide us kind of a low point and a high point for the quarter. And I'm just wondering if
the increased government activity and kind of growth from here translates to a larger and growing balance within
those accounts or you still have good visibility that those balances are ultimately going to come down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I don't have the peak and the low balance for the quarter, but again our best estimate right now, given the
information we have from the government, and again keep in mind that the government is not one entity as we
have over 200 accounts that make up the government deposit balances, so sometimes it is hard for them to have
[ph] visibility (00:35:17), but our best guess right now continues to be that we'll end of the year at balances
between $13 billion and $15 billion.
What has changed from that range is that last quarter we had a range of $11 billion to $15 billion and we just don't
think the lower range is going to happen anymore. We [ph] haven't (00:35:35) increased the upper part of the
range, but our estimates still there's going to be somewhere between $13 billion and $15 billion.

It is, I mean, non-systemic. I mean just one case of a customer that had some financial difficulty, but not at all
systemic of the real health of our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just – it looks like broader credit landscape is starting to normalize somewhat.
We're seeing consumer charge-offs kind of go higher. Are we entering a period of normalizing asset quality? And
then, I guess, in that kind of context, should we be assuming a similar level of provisioning as we do enter that
period of normalization? Or I guess is there additional room to kind of take down allowance even as we're staring
at a recession in the mainland?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
I would say, I mean, there is [ph] such a thing has (00:36:42) a good provision. I think this was the case this
quarter because a lot of it was driven by growth, not necessarily the credit environment. I think it's too early to tell.
I mean, we still have impacts of Fiona in terms of some of the numbers. So you had a little bit of higher charge-off
because of Fiona, a little bit of a higher NPLs because of Fiona. So, we still feel that we are – the credit picture is
very strong, very good and the numbers for the third quarter were very, very, very good for the organization.

Wanted to go back to the capital action question and if I understand correctly, your commentary, the Fed did not
tell you to wait. And my question specifically is, let's say, the bond market changes and we have some sort of
different environment than we presently do that would change your tangible book from here maybe earlier than
the second quarter. Could that alter your decision process? I mean, I look at the adjusted tangible book here at
12

$76 – over $76 and your stock immediately drops to $71 after you mentioned the change in the capital plan, any
color around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well. This is Ignacio. I want to make absolutely clear that this decision was not related to the Fed. It was not
requested by the Fed. This was a decision made by us. We felt probably it was prudent, given the environment
and also take into account that as opposed to other banks that have actually paused buybacks, we're still buying
back our shares to the ASRs as we speak. So, it had nothing to do with that. We wanted to give you a timetable
because that's what we think it's a reasonable time to expect. And that's what we're thinking. We're going to look
at, the world changes dramatically. There's nothing written in stone that we couldn't revisit that earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Fair enough. And then on around the margin commentary. There's maybe a little more complicated
relationship for figuring out the margin than some banks with the government deposits, so to speak. Could we
maybe take it a different direction and just think about total NII dollars? And as I look at it, it kind of seems like
your absolute dollars of NII could decline somewhere between $30 million and $40 million linked quarter. Do you
think that's a fair way to think about the fourth quarter levels or would you point me to a different number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, that will depend on what you're penciling in for loan growth and what rates you're putting in for the new loan
production, Brett, the NII, right? But the calculation on the increased cost shouldn't be very complicated is
whatever balance you have or you expect to have in government deposits plus 150 basis points from where they
are today. So, if that number comes out to be an additional $40 million, then that [ph] should number is
(00:40:35).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Carlos. And then maybe one last one. I think thematically the banks and Puerto Rico
and BPOP specifically have a big advantage to a lot of the mainland banks. Obviously, the government deposits
are more price sensitive. But generally speaking, your deposit beta, as you even illustrate in your slide deck, are
much lower than the mainland and that would presumably continue to be at least the case going forward. But just
wanted to maybe step back and just think about the balance sheet in 2023 the loan growth, do things change
from here from higher, running the sheet or will you continue to have the same sort of path?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No, I mean we've seen very good loan growth this year, maybe even a little bit better than we expected. It's
definitely sooner than we expected. You remember we were guiding to that loan growth wouldn't happen until the
second half of the year, and they actually started happening in the very first quarter of the year.
So, loan growth has performed maybe a little better than we expected. We have done on the balance sheet
exactly what you would expect us to do when that happens, [ph] we saw reducing (00:42:08) investment portfolio
and redeploy it to loans that are the perfect thing for us that we would like to do more. We are still very positive on
13


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
loan growth for the rest of this year and next year, so we're – I hope we can do more of that as next year comes
along.
Now, so, directionally, if what I just said pans out, what you should see in the balance sheet is a continued
gradual reduction in investment securities. Okay? And our investment portfolio should start to gravitate to more
normal levels. If you look historically at Popular, our investment portfolio has represented something in the high-
20s-percent of our total assets as opposed to 50% of total assets, so I would hope that we can start the path in
that direction next year. We would definitely rather have loans and relationships than investment in treasuries if
we can have them.

Operator: Our next question today comes from Kelly Motta from KBW. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thank you so much for the question. I just wanted to circle back on that slide you gave on deposit betas. I
found it really helpful. Just wanted a point of clarification when you give the historical betas for the non-public
funds, whether that is an interest bearing deposit beta or a total deposit beta, and how you expect those to –
there's an argument to be made that deposit beta should be higher than what we've seen historically given what
we're seeing with the mainland banks. So, just wondering what you guys expect for kind of the core deposit beta
run rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Okay. What we have here is in – on the chart is historical betas for the last rate cycle increase, Kelly. So it is
historical. As was mentioned earlier in the call, our historical betas have been lower than they typically are for
peer banks of ours in the states and that continues to be true this year. What is different, of course, is the mix. We
have a lot more government deposits now than we had in the last rate hike cycle.
On your question on whether they will remain the same, so far, we're tracking well. There is a lot of discussion
from very well-informed analysts that they expect betas in this cycle to end up accelerating or being a bit higher
than they were last time, simply because of our reaction to the rapid rate of – increases in rates being so quick. I
think there's some merit to that discussion. We haven't seen it yet, but of course, we won't see it until the cycle is
over. So, at this point in time, we're performing well within historical trends. And if at the end of the day, the whole
market start – ends up in [ph] higher (00:45:45) betas, we would hope that at least in our Puerto Rico bank, we'll
still remain below the market betas.

Okay. That's helpful. And then, with your margin guidance for margin to contract sequentially in 4Q, does that
factor in the public deposit guidance you gave of those coming down? And what would happen to your margin if,
for whatever reason, those ended up hanging in at similar to the current amount that they are now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Well, if you put together a couple of our comments, the first comment that we expect balances in public
deposits will be end up between $13 million and $15 million for year end. So that sort of implies that we expect
the balances to be sort of around where they are now, so that commentary incorporates maybe some reduction in
balances, but not a huge reduction in balances. It does not incorporate an increase in balances. And that's what
were to happen. And the commentary on margin does include our expectation of increase of 250 basis points in
cost of those deposits, yes.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Thomas Leddy calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back to loan growth,
another strong quarter. Have you guys seen any new entrants into the market for lending perhaps from mainland
banks that weren't as active there maybe a year ago? I mean, I know you guys always compete with them, but
maybe any changes that you can speak to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, not really. We haven't seen any new entrants. I think you may see some of it down the road for some of these
big infrastructure projects that haven't been done yet. But in the bread-and-butter commercial loan, we have not
seen any new entrants or significantly heightened levels of competition from non-US banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. And you mentioned in your presentation an increase in auto loan NCOs in the quarter. I mean,
with the acquisition a few years back of the Wells' auto portfolio, you guys are obviously a bigger auto lender on
the island. Are you in Puerto Rico seeing the used car price inflation that we've seen in the States? And then can
you share with us your outlook for credit quality in that space as we head into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
We have seen an increase in used price the same as we have seen in the mainland in Puerto Rico. So, that is – I
mean, we see it through the lower or higher realization in the – [indiscernible] (00:48:59). I mean, our outlook, I
mean, we continue to be performed much better than we had prior to the pandemic with lower early delinquency,
lower NPLs and lower charge-off across most of our portfolio, but also in the auto loan portfolio. I mean, we still

Operator: Our next question today is a follow-up from Brett Rabatin from Hovde Group. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I was going to ask you about auto, but you just addressed that. So, maybe just one
follow-up around the pipeline. As you guys see it, I mean, loan growth continue to be better than expected and –
but looking at the economic data, and it's holding in there pretty good. Is the pipeline, Lidio or Carlos, is that
actually improving relative to maybe the past quarter or what would you say about the loan pipeline relative to
where it was earlier in the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. But I would say that it's about the same. We've had good loan demand starting in the second
quarter. Obviously, I've said this before, some of our corporate business [ph] potentially (00:50:32) is lumpy. So,
you're never sure what's going to fall one quarter or the other, but I still see good loan demand across sectors in
Puerto Rico.
In every quarter, you may get a bigger loan or a smaller loan that changes the balance and also sometimes the
payoffs can come in heavy in one quarter later and lighter in the other. But in terms of loan demand, we're seeing
it steady. I mean, I have not seen any decrease for the loan demand so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then maybe one last one, if I could. Just around, you talked about the Puerto Rico environment and it
would seem like us it would be good opportunity for what's happened with Fiona to really for Wilma to really kind
of improve a lot of things in its operation but I've not heard good things. Any thoughts around Wilma and just what
you guys are hearing or are seeing from the ground level in Puerto Rico around electricity, production and how
that might possibly improve in the next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I don't know the next year, the cycle, I would say. But I think if there's ever a silver lining to something like Fiona,
any of that, and I think the Federal government has especially noticed that the recovery efforts from Maria were
much too slow. And they've created a task force to work on energy. There's a lot more emphasis. I think there's a
lot more – people understand that really we have to pick up the pace. And recently, FEMA announced that it not
necessarily tied to electricity situation, but they were going to upfront 25% of the cost of the project.
Normally, FEMA works like an insurance company where they reimburse you and part of the problem in certain
jurisdictions like ours, which could be [ph] catastrop (00:52:28), it's hard to come up with that 25%. So, I think
16


Popular, Inc.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
we're going to see is a lot more focus and Wilma is under a lot of pressure to perform, and I think the federal
government is under a lot of pressure also to show progress in this front. So, I think the pace will accelerate. And
that's the...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Sorry. Yeah. So, two quick follow ups for me. Maybe starting on the fee income guidance of around $150
million. It's a pretty large step down from this quarter. I'm just wondering, is that majority coming from gain on
sale? And then as far as the revenue sharing component that started hitting this quarter, is that the full quarter's
impact? And kind of what is that run rate look like for the Evertec revenue share?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Well, this quarter has a couple of unusual things in that number. The $9 million connected to our US
Equipment Finance company is in that number. So, the $168 million is not exactly run rate. So, if you adjust for
17


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
that, we're back to the run rate we were always referring to, $155 million to $160 million. The $150 million, we're
talking about here, there's a couple of differences. First of all is one that, it's pretty clear what's happening. We
don't have an equity pickup from Evertec anymore and that was about $6 million to $7 million a year – a quarter,
sorry. So that affects that number. And then, the other factors I mentioned will affect the number as well moving
forward.
So, I'll just disagree with the statement, it's a big change because the number, when you take unusual things
happening in the number for this quarter out, this quarter was pretty much in line with prior items.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Now, that's a fair statement. And then, just last for me on the goodwill impairment for K-2. I guess what
drove that? And the acquisition hasn't been on your books for that long, maybe just some color on what drove that
impairment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. It's – your typical goodwill exercise. The acquisition was not exactly meeting the budget the way we thought
they would. And that leads to an adjustment in the goodwill. To some extent, luckily we had structured the deal in
such a way that there were a lot of contingent payments linked to that performance. So those contingent
payments went away as well. So, at the end of the day, the effect of those two things cancelled out and didn't
have an effect on the performance for the quarter. So, it was just a matter that they are a bit slower than we
expected to meet their targets. It locally has picked up lately, so we hope they'll make up some of that grabbed.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just a quick follow-up question on the loan growth. I was wonder if you could give us some color on the
granularity of the commercial loan growth that you saw both in Puerto Rico and in the mainland, if there's any,
like, really big chunky loans in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. In Puerto Rico, we had a one large loan in the hospitality sector. Other than that, I think it's pretty much
typical stuff. So, I think the only thing that I would say that – on both markets that come to mind right away, so we
did have a large loan in Puerto Rico in the hospitality segment.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Not perhaps that size, but we have some nice loan prospects we're following up on. That one's probably bigger
than normal, the one I just mentioned. But we have some nice ones in the pipeline. But that one, to be honest,
probably a lot – a little bit bigger now than we normally do.

sectors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
We don't have that here. We'll have to work on that, Alex. We don't have broken up exactly that way. As you can
see, foreign financials, we typically break up deposits by product as opposed to by segment. So, we'll come up
with information but we don't have any right on the pack here.
