MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2024 Earnings
Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the
presentation. Please standby.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please
refer to the disclaimer in the back. Turning on page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44
on revenue of $42.5 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase in
the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights. Firm-wide IB fees were up 18% year-
on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well
as in the CCB Wealth Management business. On page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll
discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included
in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable.
For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net
income. Now, focusing on the firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5
billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix
and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in Card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and
lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12%, driven by higher firm-wide asset
management and investment banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets
revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-
year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase of the FDIC's special
assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of
$38 million.
Net charge-offs were up $160 million, predominately driven by Card. On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3.
We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which
was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to
seasonal effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially
offset by lower Card loans. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remained
financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are
still above pre-pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of
customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year.
Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue
of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-
on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7% as our [indiscernible] (00:04:08)
mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net
inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production

revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8%
year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher Card
acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income.
Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.
And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share.
Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in
technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net
charge-offs which were up $825 million year-on-year, predominately due to continued normalization in Card. The
net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card, largely offset by a release in Home Lending. Next,
the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the
last quarter we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments.
Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results including five quarters and two full
years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with
the reorganization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8
billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees
were up 21% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees
were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from
improved market conditions with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged
by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of
that is likely pulling forward from later in the year.
Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains
to be seen whether that will continue and the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the
regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin
normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit
balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7%,
driven by lower activity in Rates and Commodities compared to a strong prior-year quarter, partially offset by
strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up
3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower legal
expense.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of
$3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher non-interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and
Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year, with increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets
revenue compared to a strong prior-year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year,
driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net of higher deposit-related client
credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation,
reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-
related expense.
Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits and down 1%
quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were
down 1 percentage reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat
as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were a net
benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to
complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion,

with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year on year. Excluding net investment
valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows
and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression.
Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-
related compensation, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the JPMorgan
Asset Management China acquisition as well as higher distributional fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows
were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year on year and client assets
of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year on year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally,
loans were down 1% quarter on quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate
reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year on year. NII was $2.5 billion,
up $737 million year on year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of
$188 million.
The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses
of $868 million in the prior-year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year, predominately
driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish off, we have the outlook on page 9. We now
expect NII ex-Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at
quarter-end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion which implies a decrease in our Markets NII
guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth
and mix shift in the Markets business; and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue-neutral.
Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment
I mentioned upfront.
And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have
noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent
discrete items which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional
amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average
about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this
approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the
past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income.
We're just mentioning this to help with your models.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII
normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a
range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical, and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for
some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any
others that may come our way.
And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: The first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of
mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio,
that dividend payout ratio range should be because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between
24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding
above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here.
The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all
that. But should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me
personally. Thrilled to have you on this call. For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical
episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of
respect we have not just in your work but in your character over the last 20-plus years has been exceptional. So
on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a
pertinent question, so we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over and that's why we increased the
dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized
earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit
ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes.
If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the
15%. So look at the 15%. I'm going to oversimplify it; that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame
today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much. Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the
short run or the long run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case; it'll be something less
than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the
order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way which is
we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend, steady dividend, build the business
and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I
personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices.

I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that, so waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll
know something later and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's
very important to put in mind there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce
our CET1, too. So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are
using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how
we use the balance sheet for credit and trading. We could do things now so it's a great position to be in. We're
going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind excess capital is not wasted capital; it's
earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.

Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the
quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. A good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So, as we've been saying for
a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in
weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that
money in motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and
level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we
seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some
evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes
sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is [ph]
above (00:19:10) 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration.
And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to
change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still
expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the
yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in
weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and
the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your
outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious
to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not
meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit
stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just
said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth,
which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be
sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild
card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a
function of competitive conditions in the marketplace.
And you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying
effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the
[ph] arrow (00:21:19) bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been
not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about
deposit pricing.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more
reserve growth – for the card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just
kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of card growth and
reserve build needs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the
normal seasonal patterns of card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still
means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little
too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our
probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal
distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions
about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the card loan growth that we expect and
normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets' NII, that outlook's being
revised down by $1 billion but revenue-neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee
income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance
sheet is evolving, there are some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII. Correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little
bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally,
you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding
expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics,
no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that
are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second-order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's
what happened this quarter.
And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex-Markets is the better number to focus on in
terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would
appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think
about higher for longer, maybe the economy is too strong, so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when
you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking
up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense
of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are
up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower
income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of
course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer
is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses
are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But
what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we
don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year.
Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will
actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay
down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true
in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and
confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything
is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to
point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one
thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios but the generally accepted
economic scenario which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been
wrong.
You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera?
Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I
just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess

the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy literally in my
life or in history.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for JP and for the economy overall,
is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how would you
characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think
our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's
two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond
rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well,
obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more.
That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have
some effect. The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy,
well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and [ph] filling (00:28:36) things out and other
financial assets.
If that happens because we have stagflation, well that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have
more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will
affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really
experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are
important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that
seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will
be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people
muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot
of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.

Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel
III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six
11

weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through the cycle target, if you're at the right
capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're
over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in
consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing
deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source
of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean,
wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less
clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized
essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although
that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards.
So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit
margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little
bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on. And you did
talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in
light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how
much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually
know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate
what I've said in the past which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very
good in relative terms.
We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the
structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you
have to think of it as a headwind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is
stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market is down-pricing and obviously no June cut, no
September cut and a toss-up in December which shouldn't matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion,
if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII, so I'd anchor you to the
$89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average fund rate for the rest of the
year and multiply that times the [ph] EIR (00:33:22), like, be my guest; it's like as good as an approach as any.
But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero that very small
changes there can make a big difference and we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit
balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, so we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving
you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going to be.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared
comments. When you talked about – we all have hopes and expectations for the investment banking pipeline that
continue to move along. We obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in advisory. Can
you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing
from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to M&A on like go/no-go type of feel in
conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO
activity in the ECM markets? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure, yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of
IPOs have performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this
quarter, so I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of
pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite
good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out
type things, so dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there.
But of course, with ECM there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were pretty good this quarter.
And so, we caution a little bit there about pull-forward which is even more acute I think on the DCM side given that
quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the
first quarter, so that's a factor. And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important
question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because it's not going to impact on DCM through
acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's
definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know, I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some
pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this, so I don't know.
We're fundamentally as I said, I think, on the press call happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see
momentum in announced M&A. A little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the
regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher
comp in FIC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I
13

know that's impossible to guide on. But just maybe talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across
the fixed income and equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where given that
lingering uncertainty about rates clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're
positioning portfolios? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, really good question. I would say in general that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment
overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that together with generally
more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth is one of the reasons
that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic
period. And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious, like, oh, is this sustainable, might there be
downside here, for now that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero
bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business but it affects the
foreign exchange business.
It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting, and so all of that creates
risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those
are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And, yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes, but
it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see
you put a lot of effort into that and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk,
geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or months, I get it. On the other hand, the firm is
investing so much more outside the US, whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer or wholesale
payments. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global
wholesale payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that
business in particular doing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership off-site. That's why he
was here remote so I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse, but let me try to address some of
your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the
geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the US is not isolated from that. If we
had global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside of the
US; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et
cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of
go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera.
Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall
geopolitical environment. But for all these, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key
competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a
14

particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the
wholesale payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of
investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And
yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just as a follow up to that then, why is it doing great in terms of wholesale payments, given such the – the
dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else? Why is wholesale payments doing
great?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, I think one of the things about payments business is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof
is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession, right. We're talking
fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do
more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest
which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so,
we are seeing the benefits of that.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on investment banking for the near term
in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-
earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the investment banking side? And I just use some of your own
numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed
income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a
bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in investment
banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we
get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right,
was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth,
especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think
15


JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(JPM) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
there's meaningful upside in the investment banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds I think
particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying
industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah,
so that's why we're sort of leaning in, we're engaging with clients.
We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every
dollar of share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Cool. Maybe one other follow up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as
you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you
envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have JPMorgan pull back
on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are
some like auto governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue,
whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there
are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal
discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for
efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special
assessment added $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been
generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we
grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency.
And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make
different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So,
if you talk about like a normal recession, visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic
investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-
the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business
case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic
choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't
see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply
because of the business cycle in the short term.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet.
And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but
not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but
maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to
benefit you over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of
suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a
better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of
for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into
relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and
what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the
extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I
agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in
revenue versus too many moving parts there.
But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about
a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know,
we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity,
balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase
revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So –
that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the
ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are
clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part, in anticipation of all the uncertainty.
But it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are
very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9%
year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of
changes in spend category either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly
speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of
triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of
discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while
it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability
distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose
real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you
17


JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(JPM) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have
feared which is sort of aggressive levering up.
So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that
I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that
people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their
own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his
shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you
share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting
tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on
what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets
and to some extent the leveraged lending space is that they're exceptionally tight. So I'm sure that's reversed a
little bit in the last few days but broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit.
You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates
have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big
run-up that we saw in Equity Markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread
tightening in secondary markets.
18


JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(JPM) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 12-Apr-2024
That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does, in that
there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool and you start to see a little bit of loosening of
terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well-
prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there, so you
are seeing a little bit of that. I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space there
was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this
more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of
widening actually in those corporate lending spreads.
I don't know if that trend has like survived in the last few weeks and [ph] it's always (00:54:08) a little bit hard to
observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful
with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary
market credit spreads have rallied a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private
credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there
both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out where you may see them
bidding on business that you like but at the same time you're supporting their business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right, yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the
private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do
recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the
franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on
there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like
oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is
stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos.
So you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit
analysis capabilities, and this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is
that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger it starts to make sense to actually bring
in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big-enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean,
even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so in a funny way, the private
credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated
lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in
the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So
we're watching it, the competitive dynamics are interesting.
Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas, but we really do think that our overall value proposition and
competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.

a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first
quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know
you don't want to extrapolate that, but can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that because
this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million, down from $900 million? And then secondly, is there an
offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7
billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.

Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns. I'm
not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance, but I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is
broadly correct, so let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the
$2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very front-loaded as a
result of short-dated assets, so that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we
expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously,
as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year
calendarization effect.
There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense.
And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for
a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our
expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the
morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite
conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort
of need to size the expense [ph] base (00:59:41) accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a
bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is
higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.
It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more
typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so
on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.

As a quick follow up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just
JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and
opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to

participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups
of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding
companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to
be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private
credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.

Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on
this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the
landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things,
doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says,
the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the
capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well positioned to
deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards
different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process
and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth.
And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital
available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes
wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be
underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.
