Mariner Kemper
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, as we discuss our great second quarter
results announced yesterday afternoon. Our strong first quarter performance continued into the second quarter
with net interest income growth driven by a growing balance sheet and net interest margin expansion, along with
solid credit metrics.
We reported GAAP earnings of $101.3 million or $2.07 per share, driven by continued momentum across our
various lines of business. On an operating basis, we earned $105.9 million or $2.16 per share. Balance sheet
growth included a 7.7% linked-quarter annualized increase in average loan balances, led by commercial real
estate and construction draws on previously approved loans. Additionally, average card balances increased
26.1%, assisted by the full quarter impact of our co-brand card portfolio we acquired in March.
Top line loan production was $926 million for the quarter. Payoffs and paydowns, which are difficult to predict,
were 3.7% of balances. This is a slight increase from prior quarter but in line with our historic averages. Credit
quality in our loan portfolio remains excellent. Net charge-offs were again just 5 basis points of average loans for
the quarter, and non-performing loans fell to a meager 6 basis points of total loans.
Over the past eight quarters, our non-performing ratio has averaged 8 basis points, compared to 39 basis points
for our peer group and 35 basis points for the industry as a whole. Credit cards drove the small amount of charge-
offs we saw in the quarter, while we had a net recovery in both C&I and Specialty Lending. In fact, C&I has posted
net recoveries in four of the last five quarters.
Asset quality has been very strong in our investment real estate portfolio. Since 2016, we charged off less than $1
million cumulatively, which can be attributed to just three loans. Provision of $14.1 million reflects the continued
loan growth, along with the impact of a recalibration of our models. Our coverage ratio increased 3 basis points to
0.99% of total loans. Average total deposits grew $815 million, or 9.7%, on a linked-quarter annualized basis,
including the intentional reduction of brokered CD balances and the expected seasonal decline in public funds.
For comparison, peers reported a median annualized increase of just 4.5% for the second quarter.
Deposit growth in the quarter highlights our strong, diversified funding profile, with growth coming from nearly all
lines of business. On the Consumer front, we've had good success from private banking and retail money market
promotions, with targeted marketing investments made in the first half of the year. Excluding brokered CDs,
average client deposits increased approximately $1.3 billion from the last quarter. In fact, since the turmoil of last
spring, our deposits, excluding brokered CDs, have increased by $4.2 billion, or 14%, over the second quarter of
2023. Ram will share a more detailed look at these and other quarterly drivers shortly.
Finally, we remain excited about our pending acquisition of Heartland Financial and have shared a few updates in
the deck. While it's early in the process, we've outlined milestones and progress in the integration planning. Our
focus is to ensure a seamless transition, without disrupting business-as-usual activities. The establishment of an
integration team allows our customer-facing associates to remain focused on serving the customer and
generating growth. Again, we believe this transaction will accelerate UMB's growth strategy, further diversifying

and de-risking our business model. The addition of this high-quality franchise is a great fit from a strategic,
financial, and cultural perspectives. And we look forward to capitalizing on the many opportunities we see at the
combined company in 2025 and beyond.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mariner. Net interest income of $245.1 million represented an increase of $5.7 million, or 2.4%, reflecting
continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity. Net interest margin increased 3 basis points on a linked-
quarter basis to 2.51%, outpacing the expectations I shared previously, in large part due to stronger-than-
expected DDA balances. The increase was driven by the positive impact of 7 basis points from loan repricing and
mix, 2 basis points from the securities portfolio, 1 basis point from the level of free funds, and 2 basis points
related to various smaller items. These were partially offset by a 9 basis point reduction from higher deposit
pricing driven by mix changes.
Cycle-to-date betas on total deposits and on loan yields are 53% and 63% respectively, and continued to track
closely to our expectations for terminal betas. Looking into the third quarter, with the prospect of a Fed rate cut in
September, we would expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to second-quarter levels.
Approximately 31% of our total deposits are hard indexed to short-term interest rates. As the Fed funds rate
changes, these deposits reprice down immediately. An additional 17% of our total deposits, or what we call soft-
indexed, or balances negotiated at current prevailing market rates. On these soft-indexed deposits, we would
expect to move deposit rates down pretty quickly, following any rate cuts. Overall, we expect our deposit betas on
the way down to be immediate and steeper than peer banks, similar to our experience during this past tightening
cycle.
Coupled with favorable reinvestment of cash flows from the securities book and repricing of some loans at
accretive yield, our interest rate simulation results, shown on page 33 of our deck, show us benefiting from
interest rate cuts in Year 1, with fairly neutral implications for Year 2. As a reminder, this analysis does not include
any interest income generated from new growth or the Heartland acquisition. At this preliminary stage, we
estimate that our pro forma interest rate position will remain relatively neutral. Details and activity in our securities
portfolio are shown on Slides 30 and 31 in our deck. The combined AFS and HTM portfolios averaged $12.2
billion during the quarter, a decrease of 2.3%. We continue to purchase mortgage-backed securities and
agencies, while, as noted, security levels fluctuate based on our collateral needs for both public funds and trust
deposits.
The average purchased yield on our portfolio was 4.99% for the quarter, while securities rolling off at a yield of
2.67%. We expect $1.4 billion of securities, with a yield of 2.54% to roll off over the next 12 months. Capital levels
continued to build, with our Common Equity Tier 1 capital increasing to 11.14%, and continued growth in tangible
book value, which increased by $1.57 from March 31 to $60.58. Tangible book value per share has grown 15.3%
over the past year. As previously described in our forward purchase agreement, our regulatory capital ratios do
not include the $230 million forward equity offering agreement that we announced in April.
Turning back to the income statement, non-interest income was $144.9 million, a linked-quarter reduction of 9%,
largely due to a few non-recurring items in the prior quarter. These first quarter benefits included $8.6 million in
net gains on equity positions, a $4 million legal settlement, and a $1.8 million in gains on the sale of land.
Momentum in our fee businesses continued, with fund services assets under administration growing to $460
billion, an increase of 20% from June 30, 2023. In Private Wealth, our teams have brought in $781 million in net
4

new assets year-to-date, ahead of full-year 2023 levels. And credit and debit card spending, including from our
newly acquired retail co-brand portfolio, reached $4.7 billion in the second quarter, up from $4 billion a year ago.
Non-interest expense of $249.1 million for the quarter included pre-tax acquisition expenses of $9.6 million and a
reduction of $3.8 million in previously accrued FDIC special assessment charges. On an operating basis, non-
interest expense increased $2 million linked-quarter, and included higher processing fees related to higher
software subscription costs and various software projects, along with increased bankcard expense. Within
salaries and benefits expense, typical seasonal reductions in FICA and 401(k) costs, along with a decrease in
deferred compensation expense was partially offset by increased bonus and salary expense related to the timing
of merit increases and higher bonus accruals for 2024 year-to-date performance.
Excluding the one-time items and seasonal variances, our core expense run rate in the second quarter was
approximately $240 million. Finally, our effective tax rate was 20.1% for the quarter, compared to 18.1% in the
second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to lower income on tax-exempt
securities and a decrease in tax benefit from stock compensation. For the full year 2024, we would expect the tax
rate between 17% and 19%.
Now, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will pause
here briefly, as questions are registered. Our first question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Barclays.
Jared, your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Morning. So, maybe just to start on the pending acquisition and any potential restructuring or changes we should
expect, heading into closing, and sort of thinking around a level of brokered deposits, given your good loan-to-
deposit ratio, any securities restructurings that you anticipate, either UMBF or Heartland doing? This, as we -- as
we go into closing, any change that we should be thinking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll let Ram take that. I mean, obviously, we can't give you much in the way of guidance there, but Ram can give
us some color.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll point out to what we did in the most recent quarter, our brokered CDs and FHLB advances on one of our
pages in our investor deck, we have the rolling maturities on Page 34 of remaining FHLB brokered and the BTFP
program. So, other than carefully evaluating them when they come up for renewal, our intermediate buyers based
on our loan-to-deposit ratio and our liquidity levels, is probably less than run-offs. So, that's on our side. We don't
expect any asset-side restructuring on the investment portfolio on our book. So, no specific guidance on what
Heartland might do. But for us, other than paying down this excess liquidity that we have, there's nothing that
we're contemplating, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then, as we look at that potential run-off there, should we just assume that -- were the cash drifts
slower, the securities -- maybe you just use the cash flow from that to reduce?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes, generally. We expect the portfolio -- the bond portfolio to be relatively stable. But yeah, the excess cash
might come down just because again, given our loan-to-deposit ratio in the mid-60s, we could let it -- let these
deposits go. And obviously, as you see on Page 34, these are some of our higher cost deposits or borrowings as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then, on the DDAs, I know obviously, each quarter, you have some flex -- or some
fluctuations with end-of-period balances. Any color you can give on sort of trajectory or expectation on DDA,
whether it's end-of-period or average, as we go through the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
It is probably not much different than the comments we've made in the past, which is that, we feel like we're at the
bottom of the rotation cycle. We can't predict that really more than give you backward-looking feelings. And at the
end of the day, the way that we come up with feeling that we're close to the bottom of that rotation is the fact that
it's pretty clear that rates aren't going up from here. So -- and we feel like with our book, most of the rotation took
place -- and took place early in the cycle, as we talked about from the beginning of the cycle, that we would go
through it first. So, on a relative basis, against our peers, we believe we're probably through with most of that
rotation, as long as rates look to be going where we all believe them to be going.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And I would ignore the end-of-period DDA balances, like I saw -- always say, right. It's -- there's a lot of volatility at
quarter-end, month-end, depending on clients and verified activities, so I would not index yourself too much to
end-of-period balances.

Though it does help us make our money, right? I mean, that is a mushroom kind of the quarter. We make money
on that as it happens, typically at the end of almost every month it seems.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. So, you think we could be at a point where we start seeing growth in average, or so continue to see growth
from this quarter in average DDAs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, we -- that's -- it's hard to predict. I would say that -- that's just hard to predict, whether it's going to grow or
not. That's based on sales activities and our ability to bring in new business, which we don't forecast publicly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, just finally for me on asset quality. Asset quality is great. I was just wondering
what happened within criticized and classified in the quarter. And then, you referenced the model change for
CECL. Is that just using a different sort of Moody's baseline or what -- I guess, what drove the model change
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, Tom will take the first question. We'll turn the second part of that over to Ram.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our criticized and classified loans are basically flat quarter-over-quarter. We always have a little bit of
movement between our low-pass watch, which actually was down, and that's a pass -- part of our watchlist, but
the criticize was flat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And on the second question about CECL, we did not change our baseline assumptions. We're still 100%
indexed to Moody's baseline. From time to time, we look at our CECL models for performance, for effectiveness,
and change, and swap out macroeconomic variables, drivers, correlations. So, as part of that, we tweaked a
couple of our models just to get a higher provision, get to a 99 basis points coverage ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, all in all, on that front, we just take a conservative approach. We feel like it's the right -- it's the kind of
organization we are. And we believe in a conservative, strong, healthy reserve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
And the important part of both your questions, underlying questions is the provision -- excess provision was not
because of underlying portfolio trends. It was all quantitatively driven based on changes to CECL models that we
have and loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And I would just say, just to echo what Tom said related to those things, our books really never looked better. We
talked about criticized being flat, it's also meager 6 basis points. I mean, it hardly exists. And then, the charge-offs
are what they are. We're -- we feel very good about how we manage the company as the same team, doing the
same thing for a long time. We take it very seriously, and we're real proud of it.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
-- coming back to the margin -- how are you? Just coming back to the margin for a second, you guys are -- 2.5%
Heartland's margin looks roughly, as of last quarter, about 100 basis points higher. With the bond restructuring
from them and the accretion, I mean, you should be -- I'm trying to get a sense of like pro forma margins. So, any
comment there would be helpful, given you've talked about relative neutrality on the NIM.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's a tough question for me to answer just sitting here. I mean, as you know, right, it really depends on
what the portfolio marks on the acquisition date, whenever that has happened, right. So, there's going to be a lot
of noise related to how that accretes into income. So, I mean, you could do a simple math based on taking their --
whatever, 3.73% margin and our 2.52% margin on our earning assets and get to a number, but there's going to
be a lot more noise because of purchase accounting adjustment. So, it's really hard for us to sit here -- obviously,
they're still running their book. And it really depends on what happens to deposit betas and how we manage it

after close. So, I feel like it's too early to kind of give you a pro forma look at margin other than the comments that
I said that relatively we should be neutral from an interest rate position on a pro forma basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, longer term, it's one of the reasons we're doing the transaction, right. I mean, they do have a better
margin tied to having a smaller business book of loans, which carries a higher yield. They have a more granular
deposit base. So, I mean, it's the combination of where they run their business. Longer term, taking the
accounting noise of the marks and all that. It's part of the reason we're doing the transaction. So, longer term, we
expect that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. In terms of just broader efficiency, meaning the objective that you've accomplished over the years is
operating leverage. If I think about the bank, you've been running kind of low -- low-60s. It would feel, given the --
given that momentum, mid-50s would seem -- once you get everything in accreted and integrated, that would be
reasonable. But is there anything we're missing in terms of investments now that you're through? I think, the last
quarter, you talked about the investments you're making to go through 50. But any other guidance, as we look out
over the next couple of years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, I think we remain as -- I'm probably not going to give you what you're looking for here. But we remain as
focused on being efficient, as we have been. There's always more work to do. I think the combination of our two
companies will make us that much stronger. I would say, again, just overall, it is more operating leverage than
efficiency. So, I think the room for us, the opportunity for us is to focus more on revenue than it is expense
reduction.
We've done a lot of that efficiency work to make our systems modernized. We've said in the comments before
that we've pushed a big bowling ball through at the front end of the pandemic. We pushed a big bowling ball
through the python, right, to get our systems up and ready and modernized. And we are more focused today on
spend that's focused on customer experience. So, more than 50% of our spend is focused there. So, that should
benefit both revenue, and retention of client, and all of that.
But in general, I would say, I think our opportunities on the revenue front, and we're good at that. And I think the
exciting thing about the Heartland transaction is we'll be able to take their great, small business platform, and
layer our institutional and our C&I on top of their branch networks and their footprints. And as you're aware, the
way we've modeled all that, there are no revenue synergies in what we produce publicly. So, that's all upside, and
gravy, and yet to be seen. So, we're very excited about that. And again, I'll just re-echo that, if you think about
operating leverage, our opportunity is more on the revenue side than it's expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then, if I could just one more, Ram, on the deposit costs quarter-on-quarter change. Any particular -- I
heard your prepared remarks about the indexed deposits, but any particular product that drove the increase? I
know there's been some questions from some of the larger banks about sweep deposits. But any impact from that
or any one category you'd call out on the driving of costs?

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, the increase in costs, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, is the pipeline of institutional deposits that we've
talked about for the last couple of quarters. So, the timing of those -- Jim coming on board was the driver of the
deposit costs, and I'll let Jim answer on the sweep side, but yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Bank, NA (Investment Management)
Well, on the sweep side, I think you're referring on the healthcare portion. And for us, we don't anticipate that
being an issue. We're not a fiduciary, as you know. Those deposit transaction accounts for healthcare-related
expenses, we don't anticipate that being anything material for us going forward.

that to be largely driven by commercial real estate, as we saw here in 2Q?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll take that. Nate, thanks. For -- if you look back, we're -- the comments we made in the first quarter, the same
we would make in the second quarter as to what -- where that CRE balances were coming from, largely they were
from existing commitments that were being drawn on. We do continue to book business in CRE, multifamily and
industrial. So, there are -- there remain lots of opportunities there.
So, as we've talked before, it's less than it was because we're more focused on great current relationships that we
can broaden our relationships with, and deposits, and other business with. So, that's the case kind of transitionally
coming out of the pandemic, where there's all that excess liquidity in the system. But as far as the pipeline goes,
we actually see a very strong third quarter. And as you know, we usually only give outlook into the next 90 days
as we do that. It's a very strong third quarter. And it's coming from across the board, all of our segments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, just going back to Ram's margin guidance, I think for the back half of the
year, just kind of stable, even if we get a cut at the end of September. Just trying to understand that maybe how
conservative that guidance is just given that you seem pretty well matched up in terms of your hard and soft-
indexed deposits, relative to your true floating rate loans in terms of those percentages. And just as you kind of
continue to grow loans at pretty strong [ph] bps (00:27:09) and use some of the excess liquidity come off the bond
portfolios to support that growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, it's a complicated question. A lot of moving parts, right. The first thing, obviously, the level of DDAs,
like we answered before, I mean, we've said, it could be $10 billion, it could be $9.5 billion, or it could be $10.5
billion. So, the overall mix of deposits and timing of some institutional deposits coming in could impact our deposit
costs. But all of that, as I said in my prepared comments, we are close to 48% of our book that are priced at
market rates, that will move immediately or pretty quickly after the Fed cuts rates, right.
And we still have about $1.08 billion of fixed-rate loans that'll continue to reprice higher in the next 12 months
because they are at, call it, 200 basis points below where current market rates are. So, that's a positive as well.
And then, the third positive obviously, is what's happening in our securities book, with about $1.4 billion of cash
flows coming due at [ph] $2.54 billion (00:28:06) and getting priced 200 basis points, 250 basis points higher. So,
a lot of positive momentum on one side.
And then, the other side is just, we have 69% -- or 66% of our loans are variable in nature, 69% of them are tied
to SOFR or prime rates. So, when that happens, SOFR moves in advance of what the Fed might do, so that might
impact loan yields on the other side. So, a lot of moving parts, as I'm saying. And obviously, this is true for the
next two or three quarters before we layer on the Heartland acquisition. So, I would say, given -- I'd stick to my
original comments that we expect it to be stable. Again, it'll be dictated by what happens to mix of deposits,
including DDAs.

We will also be accretive, to your point, yeah. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, you just continue to see kind of good momentum on the institutional fee income. I'm just
curious if we can get an update in terms of the opportunities you're seeing across those lines. And just kind of any
thoughts on just kind of activity levels? And if you can kind of continue to sustain the growth rate that we've seen
over the last year, or so across institutional?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's another one of my favorite questions. I love our credit quality questions, and I love our institutional growth
questions. Just I'll take up couple of things, and let Jim add on if I miss anything since the business lines report to
him. But we continue to be positioned very well across the board, but in particular a couple of things. In AI,
alternatives, investments, within our asset servicing business is very, very strong. The profile is very strong.
There's a lot of fund creation, a lot of fundraising going on, a lot of growth within some major clients that we have.
We continue to see a really strong pipeline there, and then a lot of growth within the customer base. So, that is --
the profile there continues to be very strong. And I think, the disruption in the space with our competitors being
bought and sold also had continued to be very helpful. So, that's a really strong business with strong profile and a
great tailwind.
Corporate trust continues to be fantastically strong. And I think, the strength in travel and all that has really
pushed a lot of activity in the airline business, which is coming on, our CLO business, and such that we are
building in that space is, again, have real great tailwinds, and really good time hiring people in the space. And
again, just consolidation and hiring has been really great for us in that space. So, we continue to feel good about
that. But the rest of them are all strong. Those are some with real momentum and outsized profiles.
Our Wealth business, interestingly also, has a great profile right now. The sales activity and new generation of
assets under management there have been very strong. And so, that's nicely up quarter-over-quarter and year-
over-year. Anything you might add, Jim?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Bank, NA (Investment Management)
No. No. The only thing I would, Nate, is just, as you know, the Corporate Trust business is also a great contributor
to our deposit base. And we have the ability to move if they get -- if they balloon, we can move it off balance

sheet. We have the ability to keep it on balance sheet. Really built that out nicely or continue to invest. So, outlook
for those businesses continues to remain very strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And healthcare continues -- like I said, all the businesses are strong, profile for all of them are strong. But there's
some real momentum in Corporate Trust and AI within this -- the whole set.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Very helpful. Thank you for that. If I could just add one more, just in terms of thinking about expenses next
year. Now, it looks like you guys aren't planning to convert the systems until the fourth quarter of next year. So,
just curious, to what extent or what degree of cost saves you guys need, you can realize, assuming you close the
deal early next year ahead of the cost save, or -- I'm sorry, ahead of the conversion later in the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We'll -- I mean, we'll -- as they come in, and we execute against them, we'll report on them. It's probably
premature to tell you how, when, and it's too early really to report on that. But we would intend, obviously, to
segregate and report on those synergies and savings as they come through every quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And nothing changed from our announcement. If you go back, we expected, based on first-quarter close
and the fourth-quarter conversion, that we would get 40% of that 27.5% cost saves in the first -- in the 2025
timeframe, and then everything else in 2026 and beyond. So, no change from that perspective as of now, Nate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And you'll see, as I said, that the projections for all the same, so you'll see it come through as it comes through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. I appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Rodis Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Just a -- just a follow-up, Ram, maybe on fees, I guess, brokerage line item, if we start to see some Fed cuts, can
you hold that level, or does that start to decline a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No, that's -- no, it takes a lot of Fed cuts for that to be impacted on the negative side. It has to be 300 basis points,
or plus-400 basis points, of cuts before it impacts the 12b-1 money market revenue share. So, there's no risk of
that. To Jim's earlier point, we're still seeing opportunities to add off balance sheet, and maybe even generate
some -- but I would not expect near-term impacts because of revenue shares going that way until the Fed cuts
fairly dramatically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And quite frankly, I think the way we see it is, it's more -- if rates come down, activity will go up. So, there'll be
more activity. So, on the margin anyway, as that would hit over time, we'd see more volume also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Rodis Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Okay. Makes sense, Mariner. Thank you. And then, just one other on fees, the bankcard fees. You're $21
million to $22 million now. And just talking -- your previous comments about strong trends and stuff, and so you
feel that's up from $18 million to $19 million a quarter last year. So, this sort of new level of $21 million to $22
million seems appropriate, going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, one of the biggest drivers. So, obviously, purchase volumes, even organically, have grown up nicely, right.
We used to be at $3.5 billion of purchase volumes every quarter; a lot of it driven by healthcare. Now, we have a
lot of momentum, as you've heard from -- our fee income lines on Commercial, where our purchase volume is
growing strongly. And the biggest catalyst in the second quarter is the [ph] $115 million (00:35:34) of co-branded
card balances that we acquired.
So, that new business generated about gross $70 million of purchase volumes, fees of net of interchange -- or net
interchange fees of about $0.5 million. So, that's part of the organic and inorganic growth drivers for us. But we
feel pretty good at the higher level. It can go up and down from quarter to quarter, based on timing of incentives
from the network, or other things. But generally, we feel like the momentum is positive.

We also had a couple large new relationships on the institutional side that had card relationships that are really
starting to drive some big volume there. So, I would say, it's up from near -- neutral. I mean, the trends are
upward-sloping.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I wanted to -- I wanted to follow up just on the margin outlook for 3Q as it pertains to bond book. It seems at least
like much of the bond growth occurred later in the quarter, and the amount of repricing was elevated in 2Q,
compared to what's coming online over the next four quarters. I'm just wondering how much of that repricing took
place in the back end of the quarter, and if that's not more of a tailwind, as we go into 3Q for margin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No, the back-end balance increase that you're seeing, as we footnoted in one of our pages, time-to-time,
especially at month-end that we described earlier, there's a lot of collateral needs for trust deposits and
institutional time deposits, so we end up buying those. So, those maybe inflating what you're looking at. But
generally, across the three months in a quarter, we're always looking at every quarter to whether we want to
reinvest based on our loan-to-deposit ratio pipeline and all that.
So, I would not expect a tailwind because of the late-quarter purchases. I mean, again, this is just to satisfy
collateral needs over the last two days of the quarter and the first two days of the following -- or the last two days
of the month and the following two days. So -- and there's no tailwind to be expected in the third quarter from that.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, maybe a follow-up on the Heartland deal. I'm just wondering, the fact that you're
essentially acquiring 10 smaller institutions versus one larger one, is that an opportunity, as those are kind of
consolidated together and brought under one general operating model? Or is that a near-term risk, as that
consolidation kind of -- maybe offset some of the planned benefits, at least, in the near term of the deal closing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
That's a great question. And it was really one of the exciting things about executing this transaction. Really one of
the things that excited us is that they started a journey two years ago, basically to set themselves up to look like
us over the next five and 10 years. And this acquisition just accelerates all that work. So, they've done -- I'd said I
think, early on in one of our calls, they planted the seeds and filled the soil, and we get the harvest.
So, they've done all the hard work. They've consolidated the systems. And we had to come in and sort of layer in
all the things that we do. And so, I guess, I would say not a lot of risk to that, really more opportunity, and the
leverage the work that they've already done. So, we're pretty excited about it. We can just kind of come in and,
like I said, leverage the work they've done. So, don't see any risk there, really all opportunity.
