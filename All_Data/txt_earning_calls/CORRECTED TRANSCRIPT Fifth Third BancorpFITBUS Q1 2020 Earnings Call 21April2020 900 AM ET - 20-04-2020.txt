Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Given the unprecedented nature of the current
environment, I will focus most of my commentary on the proactive steps we are taking to navigate this crisis due
to the pandemic. And then Tayfun will provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks.
As all of you are aware, the events over the past couple of months related to the COVID-19 health crisis and
resulting economic fallout has led us to reprioritize our focus. We are taking significant and ongoing actions to
serve our customers, protect our employees, and assist our communities. We believe these proactive steps will
ultimately deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.
Starting in early February, the executive team and the board began actively planning and prioritizing the
organization's response efforts. We quickly mobilized our workforce to accommodate remote access for a large
number of employees. Currently, more than 50% of our workforce is working remotely across the company. And
for many groups, that number is over 95%. For employees who are not able to do their job remotely, we have
established social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures based on CDC guidelines.
Throughout these uncertain times, we have been proactively communicating with our customers and employees.
We have issued more than a dozen press releases, several fact sheets and numerous proactive outreaches to
our customers in addition to ongoing updates on our website. We have also significantly increased the frequency
of communications with our employees in order to keep them informed of the latest developments,
recommendations and health precautions.
From a customer perspective, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to help address the economic
challenges many of our customers are facing. We are prudently extending credit to customers in order to support
economic activity. In March alone, we extended $13 billion of new credit, including approximately $8 billion from
C&I line draws. In addition to keeping our traditional lending channels open, we are also participating in
government-sponsored programs established as part of the CARES Act such as the SBA PPP and the
forthcoming Main Street Lending Program.
With respect to PPP, we assisted approximately 10,000 clients who employ over 300,000 employees totaling
nearly $3.5 billion. To maximize our support, we recently announced we suspended share repurchases. And as
Tayfun will discuss in greater detail, we continue to have strong capital and liquidity levels to weather a prolonged
downturn.
In addition to utilizing our strong balance sheet, we are directly supporting consumers and businesses by keeping
99% of our branches open and fully operational with modified health protocols and amended hours as
appropriate. We continue to process over 100,000 branch transactions per day, underpinning our role as an
essential service provider. And for many of their banking needs, we continue to encourage our customers to use
our highly rated digital platforms in addition to our network of approximately 53,000 fee-free ATMs.
Furthermore, we continue to proactively engage with our customers. Our bankers have personally connected with
2 million customers over the past month to see how they are doing under these circumstances, both personally
and financially, and to offer assistance as needed under our extensive financial hardship relief programs. In

March, we began providing relief in the form of payment deferrals and forbearances to customers across a wide
array of lending products. We also suspended vehicle repossessions and home foreclosures.
Since the roll of our assistance programs, we have processed over 96,000 hardship requests, which represents
approximately $1.5 billion in Fifth Third loan balances in addition to $6 billion from our mortgage servicing
portfolio.
As I mentioned, taking care of our employees is a top priority. In addition to our safety measures, we have
announced special payments of up to $1,000 per employee for those providing essential banking services. These
measures have helped maintain call center operations and branch personnel at appropriate levels.
For our communities, we recently committed nearly $9 million in philanthropic funds to help address the effects of
COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to take proactive and aggressive measures to help mitigate the effects of
the downturn.
From a macro perspective, while we do not know the duration or severity of the crisis, we have spent many years
preparing for a downturn by strengthening our balance sheet through a disciplined approach to credit and by
increasing our capital and liquidity levels. We have also improved and diversified our revenue streams in our loan
portfolios. Finally, we evaluate our firm-wide resilience through stress testing our balance sheet under a range of
conditions worse than the last crisis and more severe than a regulatory-run stress test.
Since the financial crisis, we have taken several steps, which have put us in a very strong position. We
transformed our overall approach to credit risk management, centralized credit underwriting and added stringent
geographic, sector and product level concentration limits. We exited certain commercial real estate segments and
have remained disciplined in our existing CRE portfolio with client selection focused on top-tier developers and
virtually no land loans. We also continue to maintain an underweight position relative to our peers.
We exited businesses such as commodity trader lending and mezzanine lending. Three years ago, we exited $5
billion in commercial loans, given the risk/return profile. This has helped reduce our leveraged lending exposures
by over 50%.
We have also reduced our indirect commercial leasing portfolio by almost $2 billion over the past two years, which
has significantly lowered our exposure to certain assets such as commercial aircrafts and railcars. Lastly, we have
maintained our credit discipline in our consumer portfolio with a weighted average FICO score above 750.
We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative
underwriting, and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance horizon.
Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we
navigate this environment.
Our first quarter operating results reflect the strength of our franchise and the strategic decisions we made in
managing our balance sheet, our interest rate risk and our liquidity risk exposures in light of the rapid and
widespread economic deterioration we saw towards the end of the quarter.
Net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and expenses all performed in line with or better than
our January guidance, with the net charge-off ratio also consistent with our previous expectations. Tayfun will
discuss the changes in our allowance in more detail. Similar to what you have seen from many of our peers, our
4

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
reserves reflect the CECL adoption, the economic impacts of COVID-19, lower oil prices and the impact of loan
growth during the quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are in a very strong position from both a capital and liquidity
perspective. We are continuing to evaluate potential economic scenarios, but we currently believe our capital
position is strong enough to maintain our current dividend, if these conditions persist through the end of the year
while remaining well capitalized.
Before I turn over to Tayfun to discuss our results and our outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I
am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities
and each other as we navigate these unprecedented times.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.

Tayfun Tuzun
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our company is well positioned to deliver on
our pledge to provide financial support to our customers, communities and employees during the current
pandemic and the duration of the economic downturn.
It is important to note that despite the unexpected timing and nature of the events that led to the sudden decline in
economic activity, we are entering this downturn from a position of balance sheet strength that was built through
the actions that we've taken during the past few years.
Although it is impossible to predict the timing of inflection points in the economy with precision, since late 2018,
we had been anticipating an eventual change in the economic cycle after a record expansion period. Our client
selection, capital, interest rate and liquidity risk management decisions have all reflected that expectation.
What makes this downturn more challenging than others is clearly the unexpected nature of the initial trigger, and
the ensuing low visibility surrounding the depth and duration of the downturn. All parts of the global economy are
entering this cycle at the same time, but the unprecedented level of fiscal and monetary actions will undoubtedly
provide a level of support to cushion a portion of the economic setback.
The actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming months will focus on
maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients and stand by them, as we help them manage
through this difficult period.
As always, we incorporate all information that is available to us at the time when we provide commentary about
our business and discuss our expectations. Our overall perspective on the next few quarters had been very
negative at the end of the first quarter, even before the rapid deterioration in the data and market expectations
that we have seen over the past couple of weeks.
As we look at the economy today, we do not expect a V-shaped recovery. Our discussions on relevant factors,
including credit, will be based on an assumption that it will take a number of quarters before we see visible signs
of recovery. What is unclear is the interaction between the fiscal and monetary programs and the pace of the
recovery, and what the new run rate will be after that point.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Turning to slide 4, with respect to the first quarter, we are pleased with our overall financial performance despite
the economic disruption. Our performance in January and February was ahead of our expectations. Once again,
our net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the full quarter all
performed in line with or better than our guidance. Credit quality remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs
were consistent with our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially.
Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.09 impact from several notable items, including a credit
valuation adjustment for client derivatives, a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, the
impact of MB merger-related charges and a mark in our private equity portfolio, in addition to the $0.55 impact of
the provision in excess of charge-offs.
Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, first quarter pre-
provision net revenue increased 22% from the prior year. Excluding the first quarter seasonal impacts on
compensation and benefits expenses, PPNR increased 2% sequentially. Our core return on tangible common
equity, excluding AOCI, increased from the prior year to nearly 15%, and our efficiency ratio continues to trend
towards the top quartile among peers.
Moving to slide 5, total average loans increased 1% sequentially with growth balanced between the consumer
and commercial portfolios. Prior to the market disruption in March, total loan growth was generally tracking in line
with our previous guidance. Growth in average commercial loans was impacted by the line draws of
approximately $8 billion in March. Since the end of the quarter, line utilization has remained very stable.
Average commercial real estate loans were flat sequentially, with the construction book declining by 4%. Our CRE
balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low, around 80%, which is significantly lower
than our exposures prior to the last downturn, which stood at 174%. Average total consumer loans grew 1% from
last quarter.
In general, our consumer portfolio trends from the past year or so continued again during the first two months with
the auto portfolio leading the growth, reflecting strong production of $1.7 billion with healthy spreads and the
same risk return parameters as before. Clearly, the origination activity significantly slowed down in March and in
the near-term, we expect the weakness to continue. The quarter-over-quarter growth in auto was partially offset
by a decline in home equity balances.
Average deposits were up 1%. In addition, our end-of-period deposit growth exceeded our end-of-period loan
growth, which enabled us to maintain very strong liquidity levels during the quarter, even when we experienced
very high utilization rates. The ability to grow deposits so strongly, while reducing deposit rates by 14 basis points
during the quarter shows the strength of our franchise in our relationship-based banking model.
Moving on to slide 6, reported net interest income increased $1 million compared to the prior quarter with adjusted
NII increasing $3 million. The strong NII performance reflects the impact of our $11 billion cash flow hedge
portfolio as well as the wider than normal LIBOR Fed fund spread near the end of the quarter.
Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our first quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter
compared to 5 basis points last quarter. Our reported NIM increased 1 basis point, and the adjusted NIM
increased 2 basis points sequentially, which was at the upper end of our January guidance.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Our NIM performance reflected the benefits of our balance sheet hedges, proactive management of deposit rates
and a lower day count. The excess short-term liquidity levels in the first quarter caused a 3 basis point drag on
our NIM compared to last quarter.
Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 14 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous
guidance range of 8 to 10 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs to decline another 35 to 40
basis points over the next two quarters and be heavily front-loaded in the second quarter. This forecast, combined
with the deposit rate actions we have taken since the third quarter of last year in response to the Fed rate moves,
results in a cumulative beta in the mid-30s.
In the near-term, we intend to maintain higher-than-normal liquidity as we continue to gauge the duration of the
line draws and the corresponding deposit growth that we witnessed over the past month. Excluding the impact of
PPP loans, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to remain stable in the second quarter.
As a reminder, our margin is approximately two-thirds sensitive to the front end of the curve, which results in a 3
to 4 basis point reduction in NIM per 25 basis points move in Fed funds and one-third to the long end, which
results together in a cumulative 4 to 5 basis point impact.
It is worth noting once again that our differentiated hedge and securities portfolios are expected to provide strong
NIM protection on a relative basis. We executed our hedges early when the 10-year was around 3% and also
structured them to provide protection for much longer than most peers with hedge protection against lower rates
through 2024.
And as we have discussed before, our securities portfolio is also structured in a way that is meaningfully different
than peers, which results in significantly lower cash flows and less stress on the portfolio yield. Our net premium
amortization was under $1 million during the quarter.
Moving on to slide 7, we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided in January. The resilience in our
fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted noninterest income
increased by 1% sequentially despite the March headwinds compared to our previous expectation of down 3%
coming into the quarter. The strong performance was driven by mortgage banking, client financial risk
management and wealth and asset management revenues.
Mortgage banking revenue of $120 million increased $47 million sequentially, reflecting the widening of primary
secondary spreads and strong volumes, combined with the impact of the MSR valuation, net of hedges.
Origination volume of $4 billion increased 6% sequentially and 145% from the year ago quarter, as customers
took advantage of the lower rate environment to refinance. We expect second quarter mortgage revenue to be
adversely impacted by COVID-19.
In our commercial business, we generated another strong quarter of capital markets revenues, which were up
25% – over 25% from the year ago quarter. Client financial risk management revenue was very strong this
quarter, reflecting investments in talent and technology, the continued focus to deepen client relationships as well
as the market volatility during the end of the quarter.
Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter due to higher brokerage and
seasonally strong tax prep fees. We continued the AUM flow momentum again this quarter despite the broader
market dynamics.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Given the current portfolio allocations, we expect our wealth and asset management revenue to experience
approximately a [ph] 50 beta (00:21:16) relative to the S&P 500, on about a month lag.
Deposit service charges declined slightly this quarter. Commercial deposit fees were positively impacted by
deductions in earnings credit rate and solid gross TM revenue, which was offset by seasonal declines in
consumer fees.
Moving on to slide 8, first quarter reported pre-tax expenses included merger-related items totaling $7 million and
intangible amortization expense of $13 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our
materials, noninterest expense increased 2% sequentially, well below our previous guidance of 5%. In line with
previous years, our first quarter expenses were impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of
compensation awards and payroll taxes.
Excluding these seasonal items, our total expenses in the first quarter would have been down approximately 4%
sequentially. In the current environment, there will be a natural decline in expense items that are directly tied to
business performance and activity. In addition, we recognize that as we navigate this environment, investments in
projects with lower returns will need to be reprioritized, which gives us the ability to evaluate a wide range of
potential actions.
As we develop better visibility on the extent and duration of the downturn, several of these items will be
actionable. We will provide more details on our expense management in this environment in the coming months.
In March at the RBC Conference, we provided a snapshot picture of our exposures to COVID-19 high impact
sectors. Slide 9 provides an update for quarter end exposures and also expands our scope of highly impacted
industries to include nonessential retail and exposures to healthcare facilities. We are also adding more
information on the utilization rates and the percentage of the portfolio that is described as highly leveraged. The
totals on this page represent 12% of our total loans and approximately one-third of our total leverage loan
portfolio, which at the end of the quarter was just over $4 billion in outstandings.
We believe that in these segments, our client selection has been very disciplined with a focus on larger
companies that have access to capital in stressed environments. 75% of our total C&I loans in the industries most
stressed by COVID-19 are shared national credits.
In addition, on slide 10, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and more
hedged than the portfolio before the last downturn in oil prices. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based
lending. During the 2015 disruption, we experienced approximately $25 million in losses. In the current
environment, we estimate that the production breakeven is about $18 per barrel.
On slide 11, we give you an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly
indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% of the portfolio containing FICO scores of 750 or
higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see
by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime, super prime space.
From a hardship perspective, only 10% of the mortgage forbearance requests have LTVs greater than 80%,
except for those with guarantees or insurance. Also in February, we further tightened our underwriting standards,
specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels.

Turning to credit results on slide 12, net charge-offs remained near historically low levels during the quarter. The
consumer net charge-off ratio was down 12 basis points, and commercial was up 12 basis points sequentially,
resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, consistent with our previous expectations.
NPAs continue to be well behaved, up just 4% sequentially. Given the loan portfolio dynamics I mentioned earlier,
the NPA ratio was down 2 basis points sequentially. Obviously, with the adoption of CECL, we substantially
increased our reserves at the beginning of the quarter. And given the COVID-19 impact and loan growth, our
provision was 525% of charge-offs.
Slide 13 provides an overview of the major changes in our loans. Our day one build was $653 million, consistent
with our previous guidance and includes $171 million from the MB portfolio, as we discussed previously, which
was significantly impacted by the disparate manner in which purchase accounting discounts were treated under
the incurred model versus the CECL model.
The post-day one incremental allowance during the quarter was based on several factors: a significantly weaker
economic outlook, including a lower oil price, higher funded loan balances and the impact of unprecedented fiscal
and monetary stimulus. The overall approach is a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and
qualitative overlays.
We use a three-year reasonable and supportable period, followed by a two-year reversion to historic losses. The
quantitative process is based on multiple economic scenarios. The expectation for the two predominant
macroeconomic factors is a sharp downturn in GDP and a rise in unemployment in the next two quarters, the
impacts of which are partially cushioned by the aggressive levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, leading to a
very weak recovery in the fourth quarter.
The challenge associated with calibrating our expectations is, as other banks have discussed, the speed at which
the real-time updates of economic forecasts are changing.
The base scenario assumes that GDP growth will slowly start to recover in the fourth quarter and will reach a
year-over-year growth of approximately 3% in 2021, with the unemployment rate remaining above 6% throughout
2021.
The more stressful scenario has GDP continuing to decline through the first quarter of 2021 and unemployment
staying about 7% for almost the entire three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The oil price under
the base case reaches $33 in the fourth quarter, but under the more stressful scenario remains below $30
through 2021.
As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with the nine quarter total loss estimates within the
two most recent severe stress test runs that we ran, including the 2019 stress test that we ran last year despite
the fact that we were not required to submit, and the 2020 stress test that we recently submitted to the Fed, in
addition to the most recent Fed-run adverse and severe stress tests from 2018.
Our current reserves stand at 76% of the nine quarter cumulative losses projected under the 2018 Fed adverse
scenario, 44% of the nine quarter losses under the 2018 Fed severe scenario, 50% of the nine quarter losses
under the 2019 severe scenario, and 54% of the nine quarter losses under the 2020 severe scenario that we just
submitted.

In the absence of better visibility on future levels of economic activity, these reference points give you some
guidance on the strength of our current ACL ratio of 2.13%. In addition, we still have approximately $200 million or
17 basis points of our total loans in remaining discount associated with the MB portfolio.
As other management teams have mentioned during their earnings calls, most of the economic scenarios
published since the end of the quarter are forecasting a weaker outlook compared to previous forecasts. As more
quantitative and qualitative information becomes available, we will incorporate them into our reserve analysis.
As the significant fiscal and monetary support is likely to reduce the impact of both the near-term decline in the
GDP and the increase in unemployment, the more meaningful impact on reserve levels will be the shape of the
recovery and the level of the economic activity in the post-recovery period.
Turning to slide 14, our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio
ended the quarter at 9.4%, over 280 basis points above the well-capitalized minimum. Given the various
dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, RWA growth,
CECL adoption and the impact of dividends.
As a reminder, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. As you can see, the majority of the 39 basis
point change in CET1 was attributable to line draws from the commercial book, along with the impact of CECL.
Dividend payouts constitute a smaller portion of the change in CET1.
Understandably, the topic of dividend sustainability is of major interest to our shareholders. We believe that we
are similar to other banks in that we are entering this downturn from a position of strength and that strength will be
able to withstand severe downturns. That does not mean that dividends will be sustainable in all scenarios. But at
this time, we expect to maintain our dividends, which our board will continue to evaluate based on the data
available.
Our tangible book value per share was $22.02 this quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We have grown our book
value for five consecutive quarters. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pre-tax gain in our securities and
hedge portfolios was approximately $3.3 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios.
From a liquidity perspective, we have over $80 billion in readily available and contingent liquidity. Although we are
no longer subject to the LCR, we have since continued to stress test our positions on a monthly basis under
seven different types of liquidity scenarios. And we then hold ourselves to the most stressful scenario. Our liquid
securities positions have not changed, since our phaseouts of the LCR rule.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we are withdrawing our
previous full year guidance until we get more visibility on the economic environment. For the second quarter,
based on the line draws at the end of the first quarter and PPP activities, we expect low-double digit growth in
average commercial loans and relatively stable consumer loans.
Net interest income should grow slightly as a result of higher loan outstandings, while NIM tightens based on my
earlier discussion on our interest rate sensitivity. In addition to the impact of the rate environment, NIM will also be
impacted by the PPP loans and the amount of short-term liquidity on the balance sheet.
Noninterest income and expenses are both expected to decline by high-single to low-double digits from their
current levels, reflecting the impact of COVID-19-related impacts. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the
45 to 50 basis points range.

In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the
past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet.
That being said, we are in an unprecedented environment right now and have limited visibility with respect to the
economic path forward. We will continue to rely on the same principles, disciplined client selection, conservative
underwriting and a focus on long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this
environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and
a follow-up question, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer
as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning.
During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Laura,
please open the call for questions.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the outlook for credit and the interplay
there with your reserving and, as you highlighted, Tayfun, your reserve levels are very high versus – and they're
especially high versus peers, so the 213 basis points is not only high versus other regionals, but I think even more
striking is just within product category, C&I at 168 basis points. You're way above, I think, anybody who I've seen
report on reserve ratios on resi and home equity despite seeming the high-quality portfolio.
So I know there's a lot – and you talked about your estimates and your process and your assumptions. But I
guess, I just wanted your perspective a little bit on to what extent your reserving is a function of taking maybe a
more conservative stance than others within the confines of plausible scenarios? Or to what extent it actually
reflects perhaps a riskier portfolio or at least a portfolio that might be more susceptible to a downturn in terms of
the impact on lifetime losses?

Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Saul. Good question. Obviously, it is a broad question. And the difficulty here is the environment has
changed so quickly, it is difficult to compare one bank's ratios and coverage to another's. But having said that,
what we gave you on page 12 of the slide presentation is a similar set of coverage numbers for stress test runs
11

that other banks have. And clearly, our coverage levels are exceeding those losses that we have predicted
through our models compared to other banks.
What we have done is we have incorporated the – as the environment continued to deteriorate in March into the
end of the quarter and basically reflected a fairly drastic change in the economic environment, not only in the
second or third quarter, but try to project a weaker recovery into the second year and third year because we are
looking at a three-year R&S period here.

Yeah.

Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And I gave you some statistics around our assumptions. In our minds, the current fiscal and monetary policies are
likely to cushion the second and third quarter impacts, but are not going to be necessarily providing a significant
support to the latter years.
So our reserve levels, as conservative as they are at 2.13%, do reflect a slowly recovering economy rather than a
V-shaped recovery. Underlying those numbers is also the quality of the portfolio that we have. We shared with
you statistics on our consumer and mortgage portfolios, and we are also sharing some details on the commercial
book.
The commercial book, I think Jamie and Richard can comment on the commercial book, but the portions of the
commercial books that are exposed to COVID-19 also tend to be the book that has more large corporate
exposures, more heavy SNC exposures.
So all of those combined, it's hard to compare our numbers to another, but we do believe that we've appropriately
accounted for a weak outlook, slow recovery and the quality of the portfolio that we have in place. Jamie or
Richard, I don't know [ph] if you guys want to add to that (00:40:12)?

Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, Saul, so as I stepped into this chair and started looking at the portfolio, the one thing that stands out to me
is just how intentional we have been about where we do business with the clients that we select that should be
resilient in times of stress.
And frankly, the focus for us has been on companies with larger scale that should be able to persevere in this
environment. And so our loan book, I would tell you, is comprised of high-quality, liquid, resilient names and the
best data we could use to prove that point is the shared national credit information that we included on the page.
And as you can see, it's a very high percentage, it's 75%.

That also suggests that this is like – obviously, we continue to evaluate the data as it comes, we continue to
evaluate these new programs. And at the end of this quarter, we'll do that evaluation again, just like every other
bank will do. And then we'll share with you the results of our analysis.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I know this gets into the weeds, but some elements of your modeling three-year reasonable,
supportable and what not, maybe on the more conservative side than some other peers.
But one follow-up question. You did have the second consecutive quarter where you had a pretty elevated
amount of nonperforming loan formation in your commercial book. If you can talk to that, and was any of that
related to sort of the accounting noise with PCI moving to PCD and then getting reclassified into nonaccrual? Or
was there actually something underlying that that is suggesting some worsening credit trend in some parts of your
book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So on the first part of the question, there's very little impact on the PCI to PCD transition. So the NPA
inflows that you see in the deck of about $175 million was driven by several factors. One, about a third of the
inflow was a single real estate mall exposure. About one-fourth of the NPA formation is actually in smaller
businesses, business banking lower middle market. And then the remainder, when you look at what drove it, it's
really spread across industries and geographies, but the one common thread is that they're all predominantly in
the service industry, so professional, medical, education, financial advisory. So, pretty widespread there.

I was wondering if you could comment at all in terms of the PPP loans going to, I guess, those small businesses
that need them the most. I mean, obviously, this is kind of a broader question than just Fifth Third, but it seems
like a little bit of a free for all. And there's just been some articles out there about maybe some bigger companies

getting the loans and not really kind of criteria for deciding who gets it, and just wondering if you could comment
on that on your thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, this is Greg. As I mentioned, we processed about 10,000 loans for our customers to the tune about
$3.5 billion. The average loan size is about $350,000, $370,000. So that – so our portfolio I think was pretty broad
based. But we did a good job, I think, of servicing both the LMI community of businesses, small businesses in
general, very few of our loans were up for that $9 million to $10 million range.
So for our portfolio, I think we did a pretty good job of getting as much through the system as we could in the short
time that we had available – the system was available to us. Hopefully, that gets refunded tomorrow at the latest.
We've got more resources there because we definitely have a larger pent-up demand for the PPP program.
But overall, with respect to Fifth Third, I think we did a nice job and the size of our loans indicate that we served a
large portion of the smaller businesses that are out there versus the larger business.
I've read the headlines. I've seen some of the challenges that other banks are faced with as far as prioritizing
loans. We did not do that. We worked as hard as we could to get as many loans through the system. A lot of that
depends on the complexity of the request itself and the ownership structure of companies kind of dictated how
much we can get through at what pace, if your loan got through or not. But once again, we've already input a
significant additional number of applications and hopeful that the window will open here shortly and we'll get those
through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And any sense on, call it, what the pipeline is for when there's additional funding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Well, obviously, I think most bankers would agree and most people would agree that the additional $300
billion is not going to be adequate to serve the total demand that's out there right now.
We expect that $300 billion to $350 billion to be absorbed pretty quickly, even faster than the last $350 billion
were absorbed. So we think it's going to be very fast. And we don't think it's going to be adequate. We think the
demand is going to outpace – continue to outpace the available funds.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is now
open.
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
So just to piggy back off of Saul's question. You took a significant reserve build and still earned $0.04. With the
stock at $16.75 and tangible book value per share of $22, so clearly, the market is fearful of tangible book
erosion. And I guess my question here is, in the realistic scenarios for economic stress that you see, and it seems
like your band of expectations are reasonable, do you see yourself continuing to earn positive earnings during the
duration of this downturn?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good question. I will not comment on this. Look, I mean, I think our – away from reserve builds and loss
expectations, I think the underlying PPNR activity is going to continue to look good. We intend to manage our
expenses at an appropriate level relative to the environment. We have a strong protection against a lower rate
environment, and we have diversified revenue streams.
So the company has strong ability to generate capital on earnings in this environment. As I mentioned earlier, it is
a little difficult to predict exactly what will happen to the provision and the charge-offs. But clearly, our intent is to
continue to outpace the impact of the credit here. And this is one of those environments where unfortunately,
looking longer than beyond one or two quarters is extremely difficult. So we will give you a better update as we
get a better read on the environment. But obviously, we believe strongly in our ability to manage this company at
profitable levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. And just my follow-up question is, you noted that there would be a total impact of 4 to 5 basis points
on the net interest margin. If we consider each 25 basis point of decline in the short end plus what's happened to
the long end. And I'm wondering, does that include the PPP impact? And does that include the reduction in
deposit cost you anticipate? And how do you plan to fund the PPP loans that are coming on balance sheet?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So we did not give any NIM guidance this quarter, and that was on purpose. I think the general dynamics
around NIM and the impact of lower short-term rates and a flatter curve at lower rates is pretty set for us. As I
mentioned, it's 4 to 5 basis points per move. The reason why we chose not to give guidance this quarter is
because there are three – I view the second quarter as a transitionary quarter. There are three main impacts. One
15


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
of them is the very high levels of liquidity that we are carrying on our books. I mentioned that March carried a
significantly more liquidity on our balance sheet. Here in early April, we're carrying even more because some of
the government programs are starting to throw cash.
The second one is PPP, as you mentioned. And the third one is the LIBOR Fed funds spread. We expect LIBOR
Fed funds spread to tighten throughout the quarter from the current levels. And what we also believe is the high
level of liquidity that we're carrying in our balance sheet is going to give us a better ability to manage the deposit
rates down during the quarter.
So all those together, the second quarter is going to be one of those quarters that's going to be very busy. But
beyond the second quarter, that relationship between rate moves and the curve shape and our NIM impact holds
pretty tightly. So, 4 to 5 basis points is a pretty good number that you can use.

Thanks for the detail on slide 12, I think it's very helpful. And I acknowledge that similar to the prior comments that
your reserves are booked to a level that's higher than peers. Can you discuss your confidence in your reserve
relative to the DFAST numbers that you cited? I guess there approximating around 50% of DFAST severe.
Given that you are factoring in a U-shape essentially versus a V, why wouldn't you think that those numbers
should be higher? Not that I've got a problem with it or anything. I'm just saying if it is factoring in a U, should that
warrant possibly a level that's higher than about 50% of the severe DFAST? Thanks.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Yeah. In order to achieve a better level of precision, we need to know more about this environment. We are giving
you these reference points as a comparison. I think the scenarios that underlie the DFAST are known, and they
are quite severe. But no stress scenario is like the other one.
And this one, in particular, is going to be very different in the sense that the support programs are yet to be
evaluated with respect to how they impact the recovery path, and where we are going to end up. That's a big
difference because in most classic stress tests, usually the economy comes back at one point to where it starts.
What we don't know today is where this economy is going to end up when the recovery period flattens out to a
plateau.
So I'm very hesitant to answer your question because we just don't know enough about the nature of this
downturn. But at least showing you the DFAST results gives you the ability to compare us with others. And then
as this economy develops, then we have the ability to reshape our expectations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
No. Great. Okay. Thanks, Tayfun. And then another question on the reserve, do you have the allocation of the
reserve to the high impact areas that you flagged?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
So we did not provide that, John. So relative to the 2.1%, one would assume it's north of that number, but we did
not disclose that percentage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. That's fine. And then one last question, if I could. Just on the loan modifications, how much of your
loan modifications have been done on the commercial side of the portfolio? And do you have any industry
concentrations really where you're starting to see those deferrals? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So within the commercial segment, we've actually had a fairly limited number of requests in the commercial
side than the consumer side. We've only had about 400 or so, and it's predominantly covenant waivers for terms
in 2020, and that's roughly $2 billion of outstandings, and that's led by car dealers, hotels and restaurants. When
it comes to restructured or modified actual dollars, that's very small to date, with only $200 million in loan
balances.
And probably the one sector with most activity would be restaurants. You see that on slide 9, our $1.9 billion in
outstandings. The good news is we're favorably weighted with only 35% is in dining and 65% is fast food quick
service. So, about 80% of the book continues to remain open. Those that are closed are predominantly in the in-
dining category. So overall, some activity here in the modifications, but it's still a little early. We'll see how it plays
out over the course of the year.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Tayfun.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A

Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
You gave us very good detail on a number of your different risks that you have on the portfolios today. And in the
opening comments, Greg, you mentioned that, I think, about 96,000 fee waivers have been executed, also
deferrals on loans up to $1.5 billion. That, I think, represents just, under 5% of the consumer loan portfolio. Do
you guys have any expectations of where those deferrals may peak out as a percentage of your portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Let me start and then I'll just throw it over to Jamie here. First off, it's 96,000 of hardship requests, not fee
waivers. So it's 96,000 requests in total, which a lot of that included, obviously, both forbearances and deferrals in
our loan book also. But the fee waiver is actually much smaller now. Jamie, number is like 400? Is that the
number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes, about $0.5 million in fee waivers. Yes. And so Gerard, in terms of the hardship relief to date by product and
this is through the end of last week, so a little bit updated for April activity, what we're seeing is a lot of the fixed
rate or fixed payment products have the higher request levels. So auto is at 5%. Mortgages in our owned portfolio
are at 4% of the portfolio.
And then, as you see the minimum monthly payments lower in home equity and credit card, they're at 2% and
3%. So as we model, obviously, we expect this to rise as unemployment rises but the ultimate amount of hardship
relief that we give will ultimately depend on where unemployment peaks out. And for us, right now on most
products, we're offering 90-day loan payment deferrals. And then, in mortgage, we offer the six-month
forbearance. So we'll continue to update you as the quarter transpires.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Thank you. And then, obviously, the focus this quarter for you and others has always been on credit quality and
the provisions. Equally as important, Tayfun, as you pointed out, is PPNR. Can you share with us your outlook for
PPNR from the standpoint that, obviously, the second quarter end-of-period first quarter loans from the industry
was extremely high due to the drawdowns and revenues? Obviously, we'll benefit from that in the second quarter.
But as we get into the third and fourth quarters and the unemployment rate goes up, underwriting standards
tighten, should we anticipate that PPNR revenues start to shrink for you guys just because of the environment
we're in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think, Gerard, here's my take on the year. I do believe that assuming these drawdowns will stay with us for a
while, the higher loan balances will provide a decent amount of support against the lower rate environment, and
assuming that we manage the deposit rates down and our liquidity positions optimally. The year, despite the fact
that it is the worst-case scenario beyond just negative interest rates for banks, the balance sheet should support a
decent healthy level of NII.
In terms of the sequence of quarters from second into third into fourth, I think, we will probably see a changing fee
picture here, because clearly, the economy stopped, and that will have a near-term negative impact on fees in the
second quarter from spend levels to asset management based on equity levels and to some capital markets
activity. Our expectation is assuming that things start somehow normalizing either into the second half of the
second quarter or the third quarter, we should see a little healthier fee picture in the second half of the year.
And then the expense side of it, we clearly are going to benefit from lower expenses that are tied to activity. And
then we will start making some decisions on our end based on this environment. So, in general, you are going –
the second quarter definitely is going to be a transition quarter. But I do believe that as we look into the third and
fourth quarter, we are going to start seeing some normalizing PPNR levels.

Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. Hey, it's Richard. We're about a third of the way through the re-determinations. And at this point, we've seen
about a 16% drop in oil-based borrowing basis and about a 12% drop for those that are gas-based producers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then I think you said you've got a breakeven, Tayfun, you said of $18 production price?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. What Tayfun was describing was we went through the portfolio and looked at the average breakeven lifting
cost for our portfolio. So think about what it takes to get it out of the ground and what it costs – and what it would
take to service interest for that portfolio. That's about $18 when you benchmark it to NYMEX. What Tayfun didn't
give you, and I think this is important for the portfolio, we also say on slide 10, the portfolio is 80% hedged for
2020. Those hedges give our producers about $14.5 of benefit, net benefit. So if you think about – you add the
hedges to it, it's $4 or $5 breakeven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And those hedges, it sounds like a lot of them mature by the end of 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
What we've described on slide 10 is the percentage of production that is hedged, and it's 80% in 2020, and then it
rolls down to 30% in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then what happens to those loans as those hedges roll off? Do you get to be done and the borrower
has to figure out how to handle the funding? Or how does it work? Can you walk us through that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
For those under our reserve-based structure, the borrowing base is re-determined every six months. So there will
be a fall re-determination that will be based on current production, current reserves and the outlook from prices at
that time. So the borrowing base and the loan amount that we're willing to lend gets reset every six months. So to
the extent prices improve, that will change the borrowing base. To the extent they don't, the borrowing base would
come down.

The casino exposure on slide 9, the top part of the page of slide 9 refers to lending to the operating companies
within the casino and then the CRE portion would be, obviously, the land and the hotel and going along with it.
Really, the names are large companies, high-quality, resilient. So again, we feel like we're well positioned. And
while there may be losses in this portfolio, we feel like the lost content is very manageable.

Richard Stein A

It's Richard again. The only thing I'd add is, in addition to high-quality names, we're diversified by operator types,
some global operators, some native American and some regional. And in each case, high-quality operators,
usually where they – to the extent they are regional, they have got a great franchise area that is either given to
them by regulation or demographics that give them a ton of resiliency and less competition.

Hey. I guess, first of all, I just want to echo some of the prior comments, really good detail and appreciate the
disclosure. And I think at this point, just one small question, sort of a follow-up on the deferrals. I guess I'm just
curious on the commercial side. And even though it's early, I was hoping you might be able to give a little insight
as to how you would expect sort of the, I guess, the re due-diligence process to go as we come up on the end of
the deferral time period and how will that go? Sort of willingness to defer again? Or how does that entire process
work through?

Yeah. So the commercial side will just continue on a case-by-case basis with each client, as the covenant relief
periods expire. As we're executing on these covenant waivers, we have been adding some additional liquidity,
capital retention requirements as well. So we feel like the process has been productive. There's been a good

downgraded charge-off, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A

Yeah. It's Richard. So we review the portfolio actively and for the names that are going to be more impacted at
least quarterly, but there is active management, active dialogue. And so as new information comes in, we adjust
our internal risk ratings.
And then as we have financial reporting, that would be the other driver that would change our view on our risk. To
the extent that borrowers continue to perform in line with expectations, we would expect to continue the deferrals
and the forbearance that we've agreed to.
