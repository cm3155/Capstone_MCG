Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As mentioned, with me are Dave
Dykstra, our Chief Operating Officer; Dave Stoehr, our CFO; Kate Boege, our General Counsel; Tim Crane,
President; and Rich Murphy, Vice Chairman of Credit. We're going to stick with the format we started in first
quarter. You don't have to listen to me as much. You're going to listen to – Dave is going to talk more. I'm going to
give some general comments about our results. Dave Dykstra will give us a detailed analysis of the income
statement. Tim Crane will talk about the balance sheet. Rich Murphy will provide an overview of credit. And back
to me for some summary comments or thoughts about the future and, of course, time for questions.
Last April, at the start of the pandemic and the government massive response to it, [indiscernible] (00:02:20) zero-
interest-rate environment. I indicated Wintrust support will be able to try to grow through it. Today, we've
accomplished this goal, so, so far so good. Same quarter shows the strategy is working. The growth today has
been – all our growth today has been organic since that period of time.
Second quarter was all around billion dollar I'd like to say. Assets, deposits and core loans out of PPP loans grew
by approximately $1 billion plus or minus. Our growth prospects remain very good. And income for the quarter
totaled $105 million or $1.70 per common share. Year-to-date, income was $258.3 million or $4.34 per common
share.
Our reported net interest margin grew 9 basis points to 2.63% while net interest income was up $17.7 million in
Q1. If you were to back out the PPP loan income, the NIM grew 3 basis points, 2.49%. Core loan growth and
investment activity was at the end of the quarter. This bodes well for quarter three. Period end loans exceeded
average loans in the quarter by over $800 million. So we start Q3 with a nice – with that in our back pocket. I said
loan growth was excellent. All pipeline – and the pipelines in all our businesses remain very good.
It's important to [indiscernible] (00:03:48) all-time low about 39%. While normal averages closer to 50%, so we are
going to back there. We have $1 billion of growth built in there. Credit quality got even better with net charge-offs
totaling 2 basis points, NPLs and NPAs reached down. NPLs fell $11.3 million to $87.7 million or 27 basis points.
Our NPAs fell $1.6 million to stand at 22 basis points total assets. This resulted in a reserve release of about
$53.3 million. I keep saying credit can't get better; it keeps getting better. It's hard to believe.
The mortgage is experiencing inevitable decline in the quarter. Dave will discuss this in detail. It should be noted
wealth management has been immune to this growth story. Assets under administration grew to $2 billion or 5.3%
or 25% annualized in the quarter [indiscernible] (00:04:48) market and new business. Our wealth management
assets now have totaled $ 34.2 billion as compared to $32.2 million we had at quarter one, $30 billion at the end
of the prior year.
I will turn it to Dave for review of the income statement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
This is Tim. I'll do the balance sheet maybe just for a second and then turn it over to Dave. As Ed mentioned, in
the quarter, assets grew $1.1 billion to $46.7 billion. Couple of items worth highlighting here. First, we
experienced very strong core loan growth. Loans excluding PPP were up $1.2 billion in the quarter. Growth was
spread nicely across loan categories, commercial real estate and our niche businesses. Rich will share a little
more detail on a few minutes.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
On a percentage basis, this $1.2 billion equates to 15% annualized growth. And on a year-to-date basis, our loan
growth, excluding PPP, is just over 11% annualized. As Ed mentioned, we believe these growth numbers are
solid and that during the quarter we continued to see a decline in utilization. The trend in the coming quarters we
hope to reverse and will help rather than hurt our loan growth activity. In addition, the pipelines remain strong as
we see evidence of accelerating economic activity in our markets.
With respect to PPP loans, we saw a reduction of $1.4 billion as the forgiveness activity accelerated materially
during the quarter. Total PPP loans at the end of the quarter were $1.9 billion, down from a peak of $3.3 billion at
the end of the first quarter. For the remainder of the year, we remain comfortable with our loan growth target of
mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis. We could see upside with either improved line of credit utilization
or continued strong market conditions.
Deposit growth for the quarter was $932 million. The majority of the growth in noninterest-bearing DDA. This
represents annualized growth of nearly 10%. Deposit costs continued to fall as we primarily repriced term
deposits. For the quarter, the cost of interest-bearing deposits fell an additional 7 basis points to 38 basis points, a
trend we expect to continue in the coming quarters. Notably, the noninterest-bearing DDA deposits now comprise
a third of our total deposits.
As we've noted in prior quarters, we're monitoring the significant deposit growth carefully. However, we view
stable low-cost deposits as a strength of our company and we'll continue to grow those deposits related to client
relationships. Obviously, like many institutions, we also remain very liquid, with rates falling and at low levels for
most of the quarter, we held our securities position essentially stable during the quarter. We remain cautious in
our deployment of the excess liquidity, wary of locking in low long-term yields. We continue to evaluate our
options and view the appropriate deployment of this liquidity as an opportunity in future periods.
Given where we think volumes will land going forward, we expect generally steady to improving net interest
income in the coming quarters despite lower levels of PPP accretion and excluding PPP, expect a generally
steady net interest margin. Capital levels essentially held steady during the quarter with strong growth and remain
appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank. Overall, we remain well positioned to benefit from
either stronger economic activity or higher rates or both as we enter the second half of the year. Dave?

David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Tim. As Ed indicated, I'll cover the noteworthy income statement categories starting first with the net
interest income. For the second quarter of 2021, net interest income totaled $279.6 million. That was an increase
of $17.7 million as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and an increase of $16.5 million as compared to the
second quarter of last year. The $17.7 million increase in net interest income compared to the first quarter was
primarily due to earning asset growth which was up 9% over the prior quarter. Net interest margin expansion and
one additional day in the second quarter, and for your reference, one additional day approximates $3 million of
net interest income for Wintrust.
The net interest margin improved 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.63% as the rate on interest-bearing
liabilities declined 7 basis points in the second quarter as compared to the prior quarter. And a 4-basis-point
increase on the yield on earning assets was partially offset by a 2-basis-point decline in our net prefunds
contribution. The 4-basis-point improvement on the yield on earning assets was comprised of a 3-basis-point
increase on the yield on loans and a 13-basis-point increase in the yield on liquidity management assets due to
the appointment of a portion of our liquidity into investment securities late in the first quarter. The decrease in the

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to a 7-basis-point decrease on the rate paid on interest-
bearing deposits and primarily due to the lower repricing of time deposits.
PPP fee accretion as we noted in the press release was $25.2 million of recognition in the second quarter,
compared to $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 as forgiveness activity accelerated during the quarter. And
additionally, as Tim noted, the margin was again affected by excess liquidity on the balance sheet and we believe
that the deployment of such liquidity when market conditions improve will be a tailwind to our net interest margin.
Turning to provision for credit losses, similar to many other banks that have reported this quarter, Wintrust
recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $15.3 million, compared to a directionally similar negative
provision of $45.3 million in the prior quarter and $135.1 million provision expense recorded on the year-ago
quarter. The negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to
improvements in macroeconomic forecasts including improvements in the commercial real estate price index and
the BAA corporate credit spreads. Additionally, company saw improvement in the loan portfolio characteristics
during the quarter, including decreases in COVID-19-related loan modifications and improving loan risk rating
migration.
Slide 13 through 20 of the presentation deck that we provided on our website will give you additional details about
the improvement in the non-performing loans, the COVID-19 modified loans and the macroeconomic factors
impacting the allowance for credit losses. And Rich will cover credit quality in a lot more detail in just a few
minutes.
Turning to noninterest income and the noninterest expense and the income tax sections. In the noninterest
income portion of the income statement, our wealth management revenue increased $1.4 million to another
record level of $30.7 million in the second quarter, compared to $29.3 million in the first quarter. And net revenue
sources up 36% from the $22.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. This revenue source has been positively
impacted by higher equity valuations, which impact the pricing on our managed asset accounts.
Turning to mortgage banking revenue, we recently saw loan origination volume during the second quarter, but
that origination volume was off the record high levels seen in the past few quarters due to lower refinance activity
in the marketplace. To that end, the company originated approximately $1.7 billion of mortgage loans for sale on
the second quarter of 2021, down 22% from the approximately $2.2 billion in each of the prior quarter in the
second quarter of last year. Mortgage banking revenue decreased to $50.6 million for the second quarter, as
compared to $113.5 million in the first quarter of 2021, contributing to the $62.9 million reduction in revenue for
the following items: a $29 million decline in revenue related to the impact of the MSR valuation and the MSR
capitalization net of pay offs and pay downs; the $29 million negative impact of the value of the mortgage
servicing rights, primarily related to a positive fair value adjustment of $18 million in the first quarter of the year as
compared to a decrease of $5.5 million in the current quarter; as well as a decrease in the value of capitalization
of retained mortgage servicing rights due to decline in loans sold with servicing retained; another $21 million
reduction was due to reduced gain on sale primarily associated with the aforementioned lower production volume
and a $13 million decline due to secondary marketing gains and mark-to-market impact of declining interest rate
lock commitment pipelines. Our pipeline was smaller at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter.
First quarter of 2021 also benefited from atypical elevated levels of secondary marketing gains related to the
market environment in the first quarter where we had strong investor demand, general margin enhancement due
to historically strong consumer demand and the timing associated with recognized gains on hedging trades in the
prior quarter. The normalization of that market drove a quarterly swing to a more typical range of secondary gains
in the second quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Looking forward, based on the current pipeline activity, we expect mortgage originations for sale in the third
quarter to be very similar to slightly less than the origination volumes we experienced in the second quarter and
the mortgage revenue excluding any MSR valuation adjustments to be roughly in line with the second quarter or
in the mid-$50 million range. However, I should note that although the aforementioned revenue estimate for the
third quarter is expected to be in line with the second quarter, the operating expenses should trend lower in the
third quarter.
As many of you know, we essentially record the net mortgage revenue when we lock the interest rate commitment
on the majority of loans that we expect to originate and sell. Accordingly, expense reductions lag the revenue
recognition as we still need to underwrite process and close those loans that are in the pipeline as well as pay
commissions once the loans close. Since the mortgage loans in the pipeline were substantially higher at the end
of the first quarter, the expenses associated with processing and closing that pipeline naturally lagged into the
second quarter and lagged the drop off in revenue.
As the pipeline of loans has decreased during the second quarter, we would expect to see a corresponding
decrease in mortgage-related expenses in the third quarter. So currently assuming the mid-$50 million range of
revenue, excluding any MSR valuation, we anticipate mortgage-related noninterest expenses to decline further in
the third quarter in the $8 million range. I should note that when you evaluate the mortgage expenses relatives to
the mortgage revenue decline, you should consider that $29 million of the MSR valuation decline of $13 million
related to the secondary marketing gains and decline in the pipeline, or $42 million in aggregate of revenue
decline, would not have any associated expense reduction, so those amount are simply valuation measurements,
so the expense reductions really follow through with the production decline of $21 million.
So our mortgage expense reductions in the first quarter were generally $7 million to $8 million of commission
reductions, a couple of million dollars of other expense reductions, and then we expected an additional $8 million
of expense reductions in the third quarter. With that being said, I have to caveat that in the last few days, the
interest rates have dropped considerably and the pipeline of new applications has increased.
If that continues, we would expect the mortgage revenue to be higher than what I just guided, and expenses
associated with that revenue would also guide a little higher than what I just said. But we should be able to lock in
that net $8 million of additional profitability on that production decline in revenue that we saw.
Also, I should note that wild card always at the MSR valuation adjustment and it's tied to interest rates, and we're
not going to speculate on where rates will be at the end of the third quarter. And so, those amounts that I just
talked about would be exclusive of the MSRs.
Other non-interest income totaled $20.4 million in the second quarter and was up $4.7 million from the $15.7
million recorded in the prior quarter. The primary reason for that increase was a $4 million gain on the sale of two
branch locations in South Western Wisconsin. That previously disclosed transaction closed during the second
quarter.
In the noninterest expense categories, noninterest expenses totaled $280.1 million, down approximately $6.8
million or 2% from the $286.9 million recorded in the prior quarter. There are a handful of categories that account
for the majority of the change from the prior quarter that I'll focus on.

First, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by $8 million in the second quarter, compared to the
first quarter. The $8 million decline is primarily related to $7.6 million of lower commissions and incentive comp
primarily related to the decline in commissions related to the lower mortgage originations that I just talked about.
Occupancy expense totaled $17.7 million in the first quarter, decreasing $2.3 million from the $20 million recorded
in the prior quarter. That decrease was primarily the result of the first quarter of the year including a $1.4 million
impairment charge associated with the planned closure of a branch location and the current quarter having a
lower level of maintenance and recurring expense.
Similar to recent years, other than 2020, which was impacted by the pandemic, marketing expenses increased by
approximately $2.8 million from the first quarter to $11.3 million. As we've discussed on previous calls, this
category of expenses increased as our corporate sponsorships tend to be higher in the second and third quarter
of the year due primarily to our marketing efforts related to various major and minor league baseball
sponsorships, as well as sponsorship of summer time events held in the communities that we serve. So other
than those expense categories that I discussed, all other expense categories in the aggregate were up by less
than $1 million compared to the first quarter and nothing noteworthy to discuss.
Moving on to income tax expense, the effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 27%, which is in the
26% to 27% range that we would normally expect, so nothing significant there to talk about.
So in summary, other than the nuance associated with the normalizing mortgage market and the undesirable
swing in the MSR valuation, the core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth, increased
net interest margin, improved credit quality, record wealth management revenue, and lower expenses.
So with that, I will conclude my comments, and turn it over to Rich Murphy.

Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance for the quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives.
Loan growth net of PPP was $1.2 billion, and this growth was across the portfolio. But a couple of areas really
stood out.
FIRST Insurance funding, where we financed commercial insurance premiums, grew by $563 million; an
outstanding quarter which was the result of a number of new larger relationships; a hardening market, which took
our average premium up to $39,000 from $34,000 in the first quarter; and the continued popularity of financing
insurance premiums due to lower interest rates.
And Wintrust Life Finance grew by $248 million or 16% annualized. As we have seen, this product grow by over
$1 billion over the past year as more people are looking at life insurance as a key part of their estate plan and the
market allows them to finance the product at historically low rates. From a core loan perspective, commercial
loans excluding PPP grew by $148 million or 6.3% annualized, most of which closed at the very end of the
quarter. And commercial real estate loans grew by $134 million or 6.3% annualized as well.
A couple of additional notes on loan growth, pipeline levels continue to look very strong. The total core pipeline is
approximately $1.3 billion and consistent with what we saw in Q1. And as Ed and Tim pointed out, while we are
pleased with the overall level of core loan growth, we think that this number is muted by the line of – the level of
line utilization, which fell to 38% in Q2, compared to pre-pandemic levels in the upper 40% range. This lower
utilization resulted in funded balances being reduced by approximately $1 billion.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
I'd also like to point out the granularity within the portfolio. As we have talked about in prior quarters one of the
keys to our credit portfolio has been diversification across a number of product lines. This quarter was a great
example of that strategy. While we continue to have a good consistent growth from our core portfolio, our niche
products have allowed us to grow the overall portfolio well ahead of projections. In addition, slide 12 details the
geographic diversification in our portfolio. As we have stated before, Wintrust trust will always have a Chicago
Milwaukee Nexus. However, as this slide illustrates, our various product lines provides us with a meaningful
amount of credit opportunities outside of our primary markets.
From a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide 13, we continue to see meaningful improvement in credit
performance across the portfolio as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. This can be seen in a
number of metrics. Non-performing to reduce from $99 million at the end of Q1 to $88 million at the end of the
second quarter. This is roughly half the level of NPLs we saw at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
We recorded $2 million of net charge offs during the quarter which was down from $13 million in the previous
quarter. This is a very good quarter from a charge off perspective and helped by a number of recoveries primarily
out of the FIRST Insurance Funding portfolio.
We also saw a reduction of over40% in COVID-19 modified loans from $254 million to $146 million during the
quarter as outlined on slide 19. The majority of these remaining modified loans are primarily in our select high-risk
impact industries. And credit ratings continue to show meaningful positive migration as our customers continue to
recover.
Finally, on PPP, as outlined on slide 14, we funded $4.9 billion to more than 15,000 different businesses through
the PPP program. We cannot be happier with the results from this program and the positive effects that our
customers and community. It was an enormous team effort and we are so proud of the employees of Wintrust
who made it possible. We're now focused on working with our customers to process their applications for
forgiveness. This is proceeding very well as we have now processed forgiveness applications on over 90% of our
2020 PPP loans and over 85% of those loans have received their final forgiveness decision.
That concludes my comments and I'll turn it back to Ed to wrap up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our strategy throughout this has been to grow the
balance sheet during this period of low rates, use our structural hedges like mortgages to buffer the loss of the net
interest income till such time as a balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to the lower rates. PPP
loans were an expected benefit add-on to this strategy. All of the above was the accomplishment while enhancing
our asset sensitivity position anticipation and eventual higher rates.
Balance sheet growth for the year, asset grow to $1.7 billion and core loan growth of $1.7 billion excluding loans
held for sale and PPP. We've experienced all of this, as Tim laid out, has been done on a totally organic basis.
The acquisition market, which has been sleeping today appears to be picking up based upon the amount of
inbound calls we've received lately. Sellers will have a rather higher expectations, so we're going to see where all
this ends up.
As Rich said, loan pipelines remain extremely strong in all our major categories. Our asset sensitivity position is
where we want it. We continue the leg into our investment of our excess liquidity, take advantage of market blips

[indiscernible] (00:25:57) the lousy long-term rates does make a lot of sense to us. Credit is remarkably good.
Thanks to our consistently conservative credit standards, diversified loan portfolio, both our lending line and credit
folks, NPAs, NPLs are lower than they were before the start of the pandemic.
All major areas delivering strong results and assets under administration continue to grow, so to-date, the plan is
working. We need to continue in order to bring this plan to total fulfillment. Organic growth should remain strong,
we'll take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market if it actually makes some sense. [indiscernible]
(00:26:41) offset any reduction in PPP loans and we seem to be doing that. I think that at the end of the day, if we
get another $1 billion loan growth quarter and by the end of the year, we should have made up for the PPP loans,
which should actually help our margin to some extent our net interest income. So basically, we feel very good
about where we are right now. The plan as is achieving what we've set out to achieve and we continue to take
what the market gives us.
And with that, I turn over to some questions. Thank you.

Hey. Thanks for the help on some of the expectations here and depending on mortgage and NII and expenses.
And I did want to ask on loan growth. Tim, you talked about accelerating economic activity and then Rich you
talked about a little bit higher commercial at the end of the quarter. I'm curious what you guys are seeing outside
of the premium finance businesses in terms of some of the growth potential there. Is it spreading to broaden out?
And then just the sustainability of the premium finance growth as well.

Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take the course question first. So I think that we are seeing our customers feeling much better about the
prospects going into the back half of the year. I think confidence on them has really improved dramatically. I think
there are obviously some headwinds that are making people nervous. I think labor availability is an issue and
obviously the uptick in COVID cases has people a little bit anxious. But overall, I think we're feeling pretty good
about where our existing customers are. And I think we'll see line utilization increase as we go into the back half
of the year.

And as we've talked about in the past, Jon, the concept of becoming Chicago's bank has really started to happen.
I mean we really feel like, at this point in time, we are a go-to bank in terms of new opportunities. The pipelines
are very good and I think we'll continue to bring more customers on as a result of the disruption that's been in the
market. The most recent announcement as it relates to First Midwest helps us as well. So we're pretty confident
about where core loan growth might be going into the back half of the year.
As it relates to FIRST Insurance, I think the hard market is not going away anytime soon. I think that, as you see,
the team, the P&C side has done a very good job of bringing in new relationships. You got the [indiscernible]
(00:30:02) market. You really have a lot of good strong momentum there.
And the life side, similarly, we had anticipated that things were going to begin slowing down in the back half of the
year. But in talking with that team as recently as yesterday, they're also feeling very good about where the back
half of the year could go. So again, we're not changing our guidance, but we're feeling pretty comfortable right
now that momentum will continue at least through year end.

That's good. That's good. Question for you, Dave. This is a more difficult question. But when you think about the
mortgage line, and I know there's a lot that goes into it, but the business really took off when the pandemic hit.
And when you look at some of the numbers prior to the pandemic it was in this $50 million a quarter range. And
I'm just wondering if there's anything materially different about your business today than where it was pre-
pandemic other than rates? Just, obviously, what I'm trying to get at is just longer-term expectations of the
business. So anything you can do to help us out on that I'd appreciate.

Well, I think the mix between Veterans First and the retailers has been fairly stable. The refi volume has obviously
dropped off a little bit; although with this recent drop, I think that – it looks like that may be picking up a little bit
where people are bouncing back in. But longer term, I think we have better technology and we have better tools to
reach people than just guys hitting the street physically. And those tools help those guys that are hitting the street
physically to serve their customers better and do more deals.
So I think our technology is better. But at the end of the day, it's still good old fashioned service with improved
technology. I don't see anything substantially different between that mix of business or our ability to serve the
customers. Obviously, as we continue to expand our footprint a little bit in some different areas of our market, we
hopefully can pick up some additional customers. But I wouldn't say dramatically different, just an improved
product and improved service model.

Operator: And our next question coming from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Just as it relates to deposits, you've had some very good deposit growth, a lot of
liquidity created. Is your sense that these deposits are stickier? Are these new relationships, are they going to
remain on your balance sheet for quite some time or do – as things improve and customers start to spend again,
do you see a drop off in those deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, judging by the activity in our treasury area, these are all new relationships for the most part. A lot of it is left
over from the PPP loans. We picked up close to 500 new customers as we bring them in. Those are pretty sticky.
Those are all full relationships. So, Tim, your thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, David, we're watching it carefully but we feel pretty good. I mean we continue to add households.
We don't disclose numbers here, but we get the digital lift that everybody else is reporting on their calls and folks
have good tools. So we've added a couple of branches, which will continue to bring a few more online between
now and end of the year. So again, we'll watch it carefully; but so far, it's pretty sticky.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then on the lending side, the commercial side of your core C&I stuff as far as the competitive
backdrop, we talked a little bit about that. But internally, are you guys doing anything differently? Are you able to
loosen anything in your – I don't know if standards is the right word? But how have you changed internally your
willingness to lend on the commercial side over the last few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, David, I said this often. We do not change our loan policy or our pricing decisions, right away. Those are
sacrosanct. So we're not seeing any more exceptions or deviations from our profitability models. So to say we do

anything differently I would say no. We're not changing our credit stance at all. We never do that. Murphy, your
thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I know. I would agree with that. I mean it's something we talk about on a regular basis in our credit
meetings, just where the market's at because the market is very competitive. I'm sure you hear that through as
you talk to other banks that the price competition is very hot; structural competition is also pretty aggressive. So
we're very mindful of that topic and we just have to know where the lines are and I think we have really good
communication between the lines and our credit people to just to make sure that we're all on the same page and I
think we've done a pretty good job so far in that regard.
One maybe note to that is just as we continue to grow, we look at different niches all the time and we want to be
able to continue to broaden out our product suite. So that would probably be the only sort of thing that we would
maybe look to as we grow forward is just different areas. We've talked about at leasing – part of our leasing group
to be in aviation finance and we've talked about the money services group. And those are the things that we want
to continue to evolve as the opportunities start to present themselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then just a final follow-up, with the PPP and the additional relationships that you talked about maybe
you're seeing on the deposit side, are you seeing that in your low numbers today? Are your former PPP
customers out of PPP and borrowing yet? Are you seeing any loan growth attributed to these new relationships
yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
David, it's Time. We are. I mean, there's sort of two sides to that. It's obviously been a little bit of a substitution
and part of the reason you're seeing the utilization down, but we've also added new relationships and we track the
larger ones and there's over $0.5 billion in commitments that are already on the books with more to come and the
utilization there is better than our utilization overall. So, we still feel good about that. We've got more activity but
we're probably half the three quarters away through the PPP prospect pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Unfortunately, it just takes longer to bring the lending side of the relationship over, which is a lot of work
that needs to get done in terms of getting that loan structure, getting it approved, and getting it documented,
working through the payoff. But it's definitely coming. We see it on a weekly basis. We see new opportunities that
are coming as a result of our work with PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
The market disruptions was very helpful, still with MB. There's still some hangover from that. There's benefit to us.
With private, same thing. We're starting to see more of that now as Canada gets more involved down there and
they're changing some of the things that they do. We're seeing opportunities we never saw there. And I would say
First Midwest move is – you have to see what happens. But any sort of market disruption is good for us. When it

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe, Dave, a question for you on your mortgage outlook. What type of production margins are you thinking
about over the near term? That top left graph on page 10 shows a pretty steep decline, down to 2.2% last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's impacted a little bit the way we presented by the decline in inventory and the pipeline. And we also had
a little bit of there's some volatility in the secondary marketing. Last quarter, we had gains. In this quarter, we had
some small losses. But I think we're thinking about it more in the sort of 3% plus or minus range excluding any
changes in the pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow-up question. I'm not sure, Ed, maybe just not as creative as you typically are each
quarter or maybe you're trying to tell us something. But the last two press releases, your final quote has been the
exact same, something along the lines of evaluate expenses on an ongoing basis to enhance profitability. So,
should we read into that same statement two quarters in a row? And is there some sort of expense plan coming
or is it more of a big picture view that you're consciously are always aware of expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
The latter. We're always looking at expenses and working them through. At the same time, we're still are a growth
company and we're going to invest in the company. We have a number of branches opening up in markets we
haven't been in yet. Oak Park being one that's coming on board. We should – that's a great market for us. We've
never been there and do very well but it cost money to get them up and running.
Contrary to maybe what some people believe, we watch our expenses very closely with a net overhead ratio in
the mid-130s this quarter. That's about where we think we'll normalize. But I think it could be up or down

depending on some of the other things that we do. But I think that mortgage is just kind of skews everything up for
you guys. And we wish we could find a better way to show you how it all works. David explained it. There's so
many moving parts and the timing is so screwed up. You record the income in one quarter, while expense in the
next quarter, so it doesn't look right. But all in all, with the $135 million, that overhead ratio and our goal is to be in
the mid-130s right now in a normalized basis, we're comfortable, but it doesn't mean we don't always look at
expenses and try to run down.

Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. David, I just wanted to follow up on your mortgage commentary. Was there anything to call out regarding
Veterans First that volume dropped by a third or so? It seemed to drop harder than the rest of the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think their business is more heavily generally weighted towards the refinance activity and that part of the
market got hit harder. In our footprint, where we've got customers just walking to the bank and have a relationship
with the bank, the purchase activity tends to be a heavier piece of it. So I think it's just more that the mix of
purchase and refinance in the given marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just combining securities growth and what you may retain from the mortgage bank. I think you've given
guidance around 10% of production you're going to shunt on balance sheet. How should we look at that versus
how you may grow the investment securities book in this environment? Or it sounds like you're pretty cautious in
growing that securities book given the rate environment if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We've been keeping – the thought was to keep about $100 million of the sort of jumbo mortgage production on
our books. But then we also generally have maybe $100 million or so of other products that we originate in the
bank, some non-standard or a variable rate products that we typically keep on the bulk side of the bank, which is

normal, but keep $100 million of the production that we would normally sell, so couple of $100 million in total that
we would add to the balance sheet per quarter, I would say, would be a good rough number.
And on the liquidity side, you're right. As we noted earlier, we're based essentially flat quarter-end to quarter-end,
because we just – the mortgage backed rates sort of backed off a little bit and we're just being cautious on
investing that liquidity, as Ed and Tim noted, taking [ph] 175 or 180 (00:44:04) sort of rates for a long-term
instrument just doesn't seem that appealing right now. And so we're going to be patient with that and hope to
grow the loan portfolio, eat up some of that liquidity and we look at that as an opportunity. It may suppress our
earnings in the quarter a little bit by not investing. At the long-term, we look at that as an opportunity to grow the
NII and grow the margin, but we're just trying to be patient and not invest at really low rates right now.

Couple of questions on capital. The stocks coming a little bit along with the rest of the group turnaround Q1 to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

...authorization. So if the time is right, we will utilize that and go from there. So, yeah, we look at it all the time vis-
à-vis where to – just where that return on capital, where do we want to invest the money, and at certain levels, it
makes sense to buy the stock back. Like yesterday would have been a good day, but we were in a blackout
period. We'll see, but...

David Alan Dykstra A

And we also, like, compare the acquisition opportunities out there, too, so just where you're going to invest your
capital. So we look at it constantly. But I think we have about $33 million, plus or minus, availability under the prior
authorization. And if market conditions are there, we can look at what we do going forward, but as I've said,
evaluate it all the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And along those lines in terms of acquisitions, Ed or Dave, just curious. I think in the past that you've
spoken to an appetite to do a larger acquisition. I'm not sure in terms of the asset range that you guys would be
willing to go up to, but just curious how that appetite stands today with the currency where it's at. Obviously, your
capital levels are stable sequentially in a comfortable level, I'd imagine.
So, along those lines, just curious, can I get you updated thoughts on what you're seeing from an acquisition
standpoint? How large of a deal potentially you'd want to do? Historically, you guys have been strong stewards of
defending and growing tangible book value, and I imagine that'll continue to be the case going forward as you
guys entertain potential acquisition opportunities. So I'm just curious to get some updated thoughts on all those
dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We always take what the market gives us. For years, it gave us bills under $1 billion of reasonable prices.
You know how much I don't like dilution. So, we still have anywhere from under $1 billion to $2 billion or $3 billion
are out there, but we're not going to do anything stupid. We don't like giving up few years' worth of earnings to
grow when we can grow organically. Market is still viewed as good organic growth. We'll stick with that unless a
deal comes along to make strategic sense and what have you.
But I think that as to size, the market is kind of limited now when you think of that, when you think of geography.
So, I said earlier, I did a couple earnings calls ago, threw out the concept that we'll be willing to look out of our
traditional market area. I was chumming in the water to see if I can get anybody out there. It was a bad fishing
day, I guess, but haven't seen many. But we'll look at anything basically that enhances shareholder value,
franchise value, earnings and that we don't give away the house to get it. But we'll always be very disciplined in
that regard. And we'll see where it goes.
But right now, they're across the board between $3 billion, $4 billion down to $300 million. And the inbound calls
have been very – it picked up a lot. However, our price expectations for the first ones we've kind of reviewed don't
fit that criteria I talked about earlier. So, if the local guys sell to somebody else, that's good for us. The disruption
is good. So, especially they sell to somebody out of state or – I think it's harder and harder for banks now, $2
billion, $3 billion to stay competitive. Just the amount that you have to spend on technology with the additional
regulatory things that are coming down the pike from new administration, people and loans. It's getting good
loans. We all dig deeper. We're all in there trying to get those deals. It's just harder for those guys to compete. I
think it's going to take some time for them to understand the magnitude of that, what it's going to do to their
margins, their costs, and that when it does, it will bring their price expectations back in line.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Got it. And I suppose along those lines, just given the organic growth trajectory in front of you guys that's likely
going to accelerate with some of the recent disruption that was announced in Chicago from an M&A perspective. I
imagine acquisitions in that asset range that you described are probably less of a focus these days just given that
organic growth runway that's in front of you guys today that's only gone stronger within the last couple of months
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. But that doesn't mean that if a good deal came along, we wouldn't do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We can obviously do both, but organic growth is really good analogy set, but doesn't [indiscernible]
(00:50:41) out doing acquisition if market prices and strategically work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we've been – we'll be 30 years old in December. We have a good chance hitting $50 billion just
through organic growth. It's not bad from a card table to $50 billion in 30 years. So people always ask, how big do
you want to be? And I say, well, particularly, I don't care. Where you'll be five years from now? I have no idea.
We'll take what the market gives us and what makes sense. It makes sense, we'll continue to grow and grow
profitability and keep our shareholder, give our returns up and we operate on asset growth, profitability and
growth in our tangible book value. So if anything that fits those lines and advances those – are reaching those
goals is anything is available.

Hey. This is Michael Young on for Truist Securities. Thanks. Just wanted to ask as the loan growth broadens out

happen or not?

Yeah. I mean, again, as Ed pointed out before, we have a very strict pricing model that we're just not going to go.
If something is not really accretive to where we want to be, we're just not going to do it. I mean, so I think overall,
yeah, we monitor that very closely and confident that we can do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense commentary related to mortgage, obviously you guys are
seeing quite strong loan production. So, I would assume there's some natural inflation to the expense run rate but
with the offset of that $8 million potential reduction depending on production levels. Is that kind of the right way to
think about it, those two pieces?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I'm not sure if I follow this. You're just saying that in the past you think the expenses are inflated a little bit
because of the extraordinarily high volume? Is that what you're trying to get to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I guess, is it more of a net $8 million reduction that you kind of expect in expenses quarter-over-quarter assuming
the production levels you discussed or are there some core expense inflation factors from strong loan production
that would offset that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. What I was trying to get at, is I think net-net $8 million, I mean, assuming that the revenue levels in line with
the prior quarter. Now, let's say production revenues got this $5 million, let's say they're $6 million and they go up
$5 million. I would expect the expenses to go up a little bit too. So – but you should be able to maintain that delta
of roughly $8 million profit improvement on the business.

pretty well. We're open to that concept. We've done pretty well getting through a maximum value on the asset that

we do work through. So, when you – in the past, when we've looked at some of those prices, we just weren't
willing to accept the discount. But if that gap starts to narrow even more, going forward, we might take a look at
some of the portfolios where maybe we see some distress but, generally speaking, I mean, we're just kind of take
