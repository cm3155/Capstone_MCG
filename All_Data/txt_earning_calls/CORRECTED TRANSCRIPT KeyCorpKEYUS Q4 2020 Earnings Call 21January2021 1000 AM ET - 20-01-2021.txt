Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thank you, John, and good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
Joining me for the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our
presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. This morning, Key
reported record revenue and earnings. But before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to share a couple
of broader and contextual comments.
I am very proud of the way our team continues to navigate the pandemic and related economic downturn. Their
dedication, combined with our investments in talent and digital capabilities continue to serve the company, our
clients, our communities and our shareholders well.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Throughout 2020, and we successfully executed what I call our dual mandate. By that I mean responding to the
pandemic, which is a real humanitarian and economic crisis, while continuing to position Key for both growth and
success. We have taken countless steps to ensure that our teammates and our clients are both safe and well
served. Additionally, we provided billions of dollars in credit to our clients.
In 2020, we originated more than 43,000 loans amounting to $8 billion through the first round of the Paycheck
Protection Program. In fact, we are currently assisting our clients through the second round of the Paycheck
Protection Program as we speak.
As part of our National Community Benefits plan, we provided billions of dollars in support to our communities.
This included affordable housing, home lending and small business lending in low and moderate-income
communities, transformative philanthropy and renewable energy financing. Our commitment also includes
programs to advance social justice and economic inclusion across all the communities we serve.
And finally, I want to thank our teammates for rising to every challenge in 2020 in a way that kept our clients at the
center of everything we do. I am now turning to slide 3. Getting back to our performance in the fourth quarter, we
achieved a record level of revenue for both the quarter and the year. The growth in net interest income and fee
income.
Net interest income was up almost 4% from the prior quarter with an 8-basis point increase in our net interest
margin. Fee income, also a record up double-digits for both the prior quarter and the year ago period. We
continue to benefit from investments that we have made across our company, which drove both fee income and
balance sheet growth.
Let me touch on three specific areas: first, consumer mortgage. We achieved record volume in the fourth quarter
with $2.5 billion in funded loans. For the full year, our consumer mortgage originations were $8.3 billion, up 90%
from the prior year. This drove both balance sheet growth as well as a 179% increase in fee income.
Approximately one-half of our originations last year were purchase mortgages. Our pipelines remain strong, and
we expect to continue to both grow and take share.
The second area I will highlight is investment banking. This is an area where we have invested in talent and made
targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including areas such as healthcare and technology.
In the fourth quarter, we generated $243 million in fees, which represents a record quarter. We enjoy broad-based
growth across the platform, with particular strength in M&A and loan syndications, 2020 was a record year for
investment banking and debt placement fees.
Our investment banking pipelines remain strong. We believe this business will continue to be a growth engine for
us in the future. The third area is Laurel Road, and more broadly, the investments we have made in digital across
our company. Laurel Road continues to originate high-quality loans that provide us with an opportunity to build
broader digital relationships with healthcare professionals. Last year, Laurel Road originated over $2.3 billion in
loans.
At the end of March, we will launch our digital bank serving the healthcare segment, expanding our consumer
franchise nationally. This launch will broaden our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional
lending products and other value-added services. We believe that both Laurel Road and consumer mortgage will
continue to be relationship-based growth engines for our consumer business.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Our expenses this quarter were elevated. They were elevated due to higher production-related incentives,
severance and the funding of our philanthropic foundation. Additionally, COVID related expenses and costs
associated with our prepaid card also remained elevated again this quarter.
Don will cover the outlook in his remarks, but we expect expenses to come down in 2021, while concurrently
investing in talent and digital capabilities. This year, we will also be accelerating the pace of branch closures. We
expect to consolidate over 70 branches, representing 7% of our network. Most of these closures taking place in
the first half of the year.
Our decisions are driven by client behavior as more activity continues to move toward digital channels. It's also
informed by our robust analytics. We expect limited client attrition as a high percentage of the impacted branches
are located within two miles of another Key facility. Importantly, we expect to continue to grow our retail business,
while reducing operating expenses and improving overall profitability.
Credit quality remained strong this quarter, with net charge-offs of 53 basis points, within our targeted over the
cycle range. Additionally, non-performing loans declined by almost $50 million this quarter. We will continue to
support our clients, while maintaining our moderate risk profile and concurrently positioning the company to
perform well through the business cycle.
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. In
the fourth quarter, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 9.8%, which is above our targeted
range of 9% to 9.5%. The results of our recent stress tests affirm that Key is a different company today, with loss
rates and loss-absorbing capital among the best in our peer group.
Our strategic positioning allows us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, supporting organic
growth, paying dividends and of course, share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a new
share repurchase program of up to $900 million over the next 3 quarters. We also approved our first quarter
common stock dividend of $0.185 a share.
In closing, despite the challenging environment of the last year, we were able to support our clients, invest in and
grow our businesses, while maintaining our strong risk practices. Our success was driven by our dedicated team,
the strength of our business model and our relentless focus on executing our strategy. I am confident in Key's
future. We are positioned to succeed and continue to deliver on all of our commitments.
I will now turn it over to Don, who will provide details on our quarter in addition to our outlook for the coming year.
Don?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. As Chris said, it was a very strong quarter for us, with record net income from
continuing operations of $0.56 per common share, up 37% from the prior quarter and 24% from the prior year ago
period. Return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was over 16%, up over 400 basis points from
the third quarter. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation.
Turning to slide 6. Total average loans were $102 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by
growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect an increase of over $7.5 billion from the
PPP loans. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road, and as Chris mentioned,

strong performance from our consumer mortgage business. Laurel Road originated $590 million of loans this
quarter and $2.3 billion for the full year, up over 20% from the full year of 2019.
We also generated another record $2.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in the quarter, bringing the total for
the year to $8.3 billion. The investments we've made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly, add
high-quality loans to our portfolio. Linked quarter average loan balances were down 3%, reflecting paydowns from
the heightened commercial loan draws, as well as a small reduction in PPP balances related to initial forgiveness.
Line utilization rates are at the pre-pandemic levels given the strong liquidity levels in the environment.
Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from business that
does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through the business cycle, and
we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective.
Continuing on to slide 7, average deposits totaled $136 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, up $23 billion or 21%
compared to the year ago period and up 0.6% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter increase reflected a
broad-based commercial growth as well as growth from higher consumer balances. The growth was offset by a
continued and expected decline in time deposits.
Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. Total interest-bearing deposit
costs came down 11 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of a 6 to 9 basis point
decline. Continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of
the total deposit mix.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.043 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020
compared to $987 million a year ago and just over $1 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was
2.70% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.98% for the same period last year, and 2.62% from the prior
quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in
our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but
reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $37 million, and the margin improved by 8 basis
points. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin quarter-over-quarter are largely due
to the lower interest-bearing deposit cost and the higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness.
We saw the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 11 basis points from the prior quarter. The
forgiveness of the PPP loans accelerated about $28 million of additional fee recognition this quarter. These were
partially offset by continued elevated liquidity levels, which had a 5-basis point negative impact on the margin.
Moving to slide 9. Our fee-based businesses hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter. Noninterest income was $802
million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $651 million for the year ago period, and $681 million for the
third quarter.
Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased $151 million. The primary driver was a record
quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $243 million, up $62 million from the year
ago period. Stronger M&A and loan syndication fees drove most of the increase this quarter. This business also
had a record year with $661 million of total fees.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Record mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $22 million from the
fourth quarter of 2019. Cards and payments income also increased $30 million related to higher prepaid card
activity from the state government support programs.
Compared to the third quarter, noninterest income increased by $121 million. The largest driver of the quarterly
increase was once again the record quarter for investment banking, which was up $97 million. Commercial
mortgage servicing fees also had a strong quarter, up $14 million.
I'm now turning to slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.128 billion, compared to $980 million
last year and $1.037 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel costs
driven by higher production related incentives from our record fee production as well as higher severance costs.
Year-over-year, payments related costs reported in other expense were $40 million higher, driven by higher
prepaid activity, and we incurred COVID-19 related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates.
Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $91 million. The increase was largely due to $40
million of higher production related incentives, $22 million of severance, $12 million of higher stock-based
compensation related to the share price, and a $15 million additional contribution to our charitable foundation.
Marketing expense was also up $8 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to slide 11. Overall, credit quality remains strong. For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were $135 million
or 53 basis points of average loans, slightly below our guidance range. Our provision for credit losses was $20
million. This was determined under the CECL methodology and based on our continued strong credit metrics and
leading indicators, as well as our outlook for the overall economy, credit migration and loan production.
Nonperforming loans were $785 million this quarter, or 78 basis points of period-end loans, compared to $834
million or 81 basis points from the prior quarter.
Additionally, 30-day to 89-day delinquencies actually improved quarter-over-quarter with a 9-basis point decrease,
while the 90-day plus category remained relatively flat. We've continued to monitor the level of assistance
requests we receive from our customers. Over the past quarter, the number of requests for loan forbearance has
decreased dramatically.
As of December 31, loans subject to forbearance terms were less than $600 million, down from a peak of $5.2
billion, equating to about 0.5% of our outstanding balances. One more observation this quarter, and as Chris
mentioned earlier, in late December, the results of the most recent stress test results were published.
Key's results reinforce the commitments we have been making over the past several years that we are a different
company with a better risk profile than Key showed through The Great Recession. Our stressed credit losses for –
from the test were peer leading. We've been managing the company over the last decade to outperform during
challenging times and believe we have positioned the company to achieve this.
Turning to slide 12. We updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater focus in
this environment. These areas represent a small percentage of the total loan balances. Each relationship in these
focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhance monitoring. Importantly, as a group, they
continue to perform consistent with our expectations.
Now on to slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the fourth quarter with a
common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, up 30 basis points from 9.5% in the third quarter. This places us above our

targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and
their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.
Importantly, the results of the recent stress test support and highlight our strong credit profile and loss-absorbing
capital. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $900 million
for the next three quarters. They also approved our first quarter 2021 common dividend of $0.185 per share.
On slide 14, we provide our full year 2021 outlook. This builds on our performance in 2020 and reflects our
expectation that we will deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Guidance range definitions are provided
at the bottom of the slide.
Average loans are expected to be relatively stable. Although at this point, I would expect a little downward bias to
this range. This reflects participation in the next round of PPP and continued growth in our consumer loan
portfolio from both Laurel Road and our consumer mortgage business.
We expect deposits to be up low single-digits, and we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. Net
interest income should be relatively stable. Our net interest income will benefit from our higher loan fees related to
PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low
rates.
Non-interest income should be up low single digits, reflecting growth in most of our core fee-based businesses.
As Chris mentioned, non-interest expense should be down in 2021, somewhere in the low single-digit range. We
will continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts and accelerated branch closures. We also plan to
continue to invest in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings.
Moving on to credit quality. Net charge-offs to average loans should be in the 50 basis points to 60 basis point
range, which is consistent with our through-the-cycle range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. And our
guidance for our GAAP tax rate should be around 19% for the year.
Our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year. First quarter will reflect normal
seasonality, including a lower day count and an increase in personnel expense, driven by heightened employee
benefits.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. As Chris said, we expect to deliver positive
operating leverage for 2021. We also maintain our moderate risk profile, and over time, continue to improve our
efficiency and overall returns.
I'll close with where Chris started. Recognizing the effort of our team to support our clients and to deliver strong
results for both the quarter and the year, despite the challenging environment. We are well positioned as we head
into 2021 and plan to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. John?

Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just curious, I guess, I can infer it from the up low single-digit guide on fees, but I was hoping you could provide a
little more thoughts on your outlook for investment banking. It ended up being just a terrific end to the year. But
maybe your thoughts on how you see the year playing out just in terms of the nuance.
I feel like last year, it was kind of less traditional M&A sort of other drivers within investment banking or that line
item that drove it. Whereas this year, maybe it's more the traditional stuff that we would think of. How do you see
it planning out? And do you think you can sustain this level or grow upon this level of annual revenues in total
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Scott. Well, thanks for the question. Just to step back for a second. Our integrated corporate and
investment bank is a unique and growing franchise. It's unique among all of our peers.
It's really hard both to coordinate and collaborate and get it done from a cultural perspective. And as you know,
Scott, we've been at it for a long time. And we've made a bunch of significant investments, if you think about the
investments we've made in technology and in healthcare.
Within any year, there's always variability. But as we step back and look at that business over the past five years,
it's had a compound annual growth rate of about 8%. And so – and if you look at from 2015 to present, I think
we've had one year where we were down slightly, I think last year down like 3%.
So, I'm just giving you that as kind of a backdrop as we look forward. There's no question that it's the transaction
business, and there's a lot of variables that clearly are not within our control.
Having said that, for us it's a relationship business, we continue to grow it. Our pipelines today are strong. Our
pipelines are in good shape. And what's interesting about our business is whereas a lot of people had a huge lift
from investment-grade debt through the pandemic, that really is not core to our business.

Our business was really driven, Scott, by a big surge in M&A and syndications, in some cases, related
syndications. So, we feel good about the trajectory of the business, and we'll continue to invest in it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Terrific. Thank you. And then, I guess, more of a tiggy-tag guidance question in expenses. I know you had the
$22 million in severance cost in the fourth quarter. Will there be any further charges? Or did you sort of take care
of all of those in the fourth quarter? And if there are any, are those included in the full year 2021 guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
We would typically have some severance throughout the year. We would not expect to have any of that size going
forward into the – each of the quarters in 2021. So, the normal recurring level would be reflected in that guidance,
but not assuming any significant charges on top of that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about loan yields. Although there were some quarters of relative
stability in Key's loan yields during the last [ph] zerve (24:25) cycle, the overall trajectory of loan yields was lower
until we exited [ph] zerve (24:30). I believe you guys have about 70% of your loan book is indexed to the short
end of the interest rate complex. And so, a lot of it's re-priced already, but there's still some and that dynamic
happened not just for you guys, but for other banks as well. So, can you discuss whether you expect downward
pressure on loan yields to persist in this [ph] zerve (24:48) cycle as well? And are you simply going to work
through it to offset those headwinds? In general, is there anything, I guess, different about this cycle that leads
you to expect those dynamics to play out any differently at this time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Administrative
Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. A couple of things there, one, on the loan book that – keep in mind that a significant portion of the swaps
that we enter into from a balance sheet perspective are matched up against the commercial loan book. And so, it
does convert some of those over to fixed rates and we've talked over the last couple of quarters about the impact
of those swaps going forward. And so, you will see some very modest pressure on yields coming from that as
those swaps roll over.

On the consumer book, we are seeing rates coming down as far as the new originations compared to what was
the existing book, but we're also seeing improved credit quality for those new originations. And we're also seeing
margins a little wider on the consumer originations compared to the current rate environment than where we've
been historically. And so that will also help.
And so there will be some pressure going forward, but I would say that we still have other levers to help offset
that, including the full year benefit of the re-pricing of our deposit book that we realized in the fourth quarter. And
then also, just this excess liquidity position, we think, over time, we can start to absorb some of that and maybe
reinvest that over time as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Don. That's super helpful. Maybe along the similar lines, can you talk about PPP, how much
PPP contributed to loan yields this quarter? And how we should expect that contribution to loan yields and NII to
trend from here? Maybe any color on how long the benefits of PPP, 1.0 and 2.0 are going to last just largely
through the rest of 2021 or do they extend to 2022? And that's my last question. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
That's great. And we've mentioned just briefly that in the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of the PPP
loans becomes forgiven. And so that accelerated about $28 million of fee income for the quarter. And so that
roughly added about 6 basis points or so as far as the overall margin and so that clearly was additive. If you look
at that first wave of PPP loans, we had about $8 billion of issuance, that as I mentioned, we had about $1.3 billion
of forgiveness this quarter. And so that puts about $6.7 billion. We would expect about 80% of that initial $8 billion
be forgiven. And so, you'll see that come throughout the rest of the year. I would say that, for example, we would
expect about $1 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter. And so that's a little less than what we would have seen
in the fourth quarter, but still continue to show that kind of a pace.
The next wave of PPP will be helpful for that and we would expect to see about $2.5 billion of originations in the
second quarter. And so, some of that decline that we would be expecting from that forgiveness will be directly
offset by the new originations and we'll probably start the end of the first quarter with balances of over $8 billion.
And so, I think that is helpful as far as just the perspective there.
As far as the fee income component to it, that if you look at both the normal accretion of the fee income plus the
acceleration coming from the forgiveness, that was about $110 million of fee income for 2020. We would expect
for the first wave of those $8 billion of loans that number would be up to around $120 million or so as far as the
fee income from both normal accretion and also the impact of forgiveness. And so, we have a little bit of a lift on a
year-over-year basis from that.
And then on top of that, we would have the benefit from the new wave two of the PPP program coming through
with loan yields and fee income realization from those credits as well.

I would say that the vast majority of the first wave will clearly be addressed in 2021. We'll probably see some of
this next wave continue to hang over into 2022 as well. And so, I would say that, that incremental lift that we're
getting from that will be realized in both 2021 and 2022.

can you just reconfirm for us just how much do you think Laurel Road can do this year? And how much more the
mortgage business can grow as an offset to the planned runoff in the auto portfolio on the consumer side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure can, that – as far as consumer loans that relatively stable outlook for total loans would assume consumer
loans in aggregate grow about $2 billion and – from 2020 to 2021 and that growth really coming from both
residential mortgage and from Laurel Road.
Just to put that in perspective, we had almost $600 million of originations from Laurel Road in the fourth quarter.
Just continuing at that pace would be in the $2.5 billion type of range as far as 2021 originations from that
category. On the residential mortgage side that despite what we're seeing and hearing in the industry that we
think that we can actually show stable to maybe even increasing our overall residential mortgage originations in
2021.

But keep in mind that we are at the early stages as far as rolling out that platform throughout our branch network,
seeing strong growth there. And of that $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and of the $8.3 billion for the full year,
about half of that was for purchase money as opposed to refinance.
And so, we think there still will be opportunities to continue to show growth there, and that's adding over $1 billion
a quarter as far as the new loan originations in the residential mortgage side. And so that consumer growth in
those two areas specifically are at the foundation of how we can get to that kind of relatively stable outlook for
total loans.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then just a follow-up on expenses. Given the plan for expenses to be overall flat, I'm just wondering,
you have some variability in the investment banking stuff, but just in terms of the cadence of it, given the plan to
reduce branches and the severance-related benefits that you get over time. Is there any way to understand like
the cadence of how expenses traject through the year? Whether or not you're ending lower than you're starting
that type of thing? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Great question. And I think you've hit on some of the challenge there, which is that a number of our drivers of our
revenue growth, really have a variable cost component to it as far as the origination and so that's a little bit of a
challenge. I would say that as we look going into the first quarter, we would tend to have some seasonality in
those numbers, and we highlighted a little bit as far as the benefit expense being up in the first quarter. We would
expect expenses down considerably from where they were in the fourth quarter, but probably up from what we
would have seen last year.
Last year, our revenue outlook was negatively impacted by some market valuation adjustments that also had a
corresponding adjustment to our incentive compensation. And so, we think that we'll be in a position to generate
positive operating leverage for the first quarter and have positive operating leverage for the full year. And I just
want to restate that as far as our expense outlook, we are saying it's down low single digits, so down 1% to 3% as
opposed to stable. And so that's after funding the investments we're making as part of our strategic initiatives as
well.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Hey, good morning. So, I just wanted to back up a little, just make sure I understand the mechanics on the PPP
dynamics through net interest income. So, on the – there's an incremental, I guess, $10 million, so pretty modest
on the first waves of PPP and then on top of that, you overlay the second round, which I think you said was $2.5
billion. So, if we were to – adding that second round and obviously recognizing that these are five years, and the
fee rates might be lower. I mean, how much of an incremental lift is that from the second round?
Are we talking – it seems like a modest number, but would be talking in the neighborhood of something like $10
million a quarter, if you could just kind of help us square away sort of the full year and connect the dots fully on
the full year 2021 versus the full year 2020 tailwind that you get more broadly from PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure can. As far as the impact of that second wave, we talked about $2.5 billion in the first quarter. I would say
that the full year average probably will be somewhere around $3 billion related to that next wave of the PPP
loans. If you look at both the stated coupon on those loans and the realization of the fee income, it tends to be
something a little north of 2% type of yield. So, you pick up over 200 basis points on those balances through the
year. So, you're probably looking at something for the full year, somewhere around $60 million kind of a lift from
that compared to just having it sit in cash.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, we should think about the tailwind then just 2021 versus 2020 from PPP more broadly being sort of that $60
million plus the incremental $10 million of $120 million versus $110 million, so something in the neighborhood of
$70 million. Is that a fair way of looking at it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Well, what I would say is that for the fee income, we had $110 million in 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
For the first wave, that's about $120 million for that first wave of loans and then this new origination volume of the
roughly $3 billion for average would be on top of that. And so, we'll actually see a lift year-over-year of say, $70
million would be a ballpark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q

Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Administrative

From the swaps, when you say benefit, I'm reluctant to know what that is because it is part of our true hedging
strategy. And so as far as the cash flow swaps, the net interest income add to us for those cash flows swaps is
about $90 million, which is down about $5 million – excuse me, about $4 million from the previous quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Don, can you share with us, when you look at the allowance for loan losses, currently based on your slides,
excluding the PPP loans, it looks like you're at about 193 basis points. And at the start of the year when all of you
and your peers had to convert over to the CECL reserving, I think your reserves are about 122 basis points. As
we look further out, maybe end of 2022, what do you think the reserve levels could get to? Do you think they
could get back down to where they were in January of this year before the pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I think we could see trends in that direction. I don't know the absolute timing of that. I don't know how to predict
where the economic outlook will shift over time. But I would say as we go into 2021, that the three pieces that
impact our provision expense under CECL are: one, the economic outlook.
And so, assuming that's stable with what we would have predicted, won't see any impact there. Credit migration
has been a positive for us. And each quarter, as we take a look at what our projected credit losses are, that trend
continues to get better. And so that's allowing for reductions to the provision compared to normal.
And then the third piece is for loan production. I mentioned on the call a couple of times in the last few quarters is
that provision each quarter would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. And so, if the economic outlook
doesn't change and if the migration is consistent with expectations, that would imply about a $90 million per
quarter provision expense on average and about $360 million for the year, which would be below what that
charge-off guidance would imply. And so, we would expect to see that allowance ratio come down over time and
could have some opportunity to see that come down more quickly if we continue to see the credit migration
outperform like we have.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Very good. Thank you for those insights. And Chris, a bigger question for you or a bigger picture. Obviously, Key
and your peers are positioned to really benefit from a recovery in the US economy coming hopefully this year as
the vaccines are more widespread by the summertime. The stock shares included since the Pfizer announcement
in November, have had a real strong run here. And so, everything is shaping out good. And as you pointed out,
your fourth quarter investment banking numbers were blockbuster. When you go home at night and you go down
the elevator, what are the risks that you think about? Since things are shaping up pretty good for you and your
peers as we look out over the next 12 months?

Gerard, I think for our entire industry, the number one risk is cyber. I think we're in the trust business. And to the
extent there was a significant breach in the industry or of any particular company, I think that is – I think that's the
number one risk. The number two risk I think that we all need to focus on are just a whole another cadre of
competitors. If you think about a lot of the fintechs and you think about what some of those companies have been
able to do in terms of garnering new clients, I think that is a strategic risk.
Kind of more tactically, we think about sort of the key areas where I think you could see significant degradation in
asset values. And fortunately, we're well positioned here. But I think the obvious ones are travel and

entertainment. I think that's, as you point out, I think that that will come back because I think the vaccine has a lot
to do with that. I think the hospitality industry is one that you need to focus on.
The other couple of areas, and as you know, we've been out of them by strategy is both retail and office. I think
those are areas that as an industry, we need to keep a close eye on. So those are kind of starting with sort of
strategic down to tactical, what I think about.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes. Hi. My first question, I'm sorry for another question on your net interest income outlook. But I'm wondering, if
you could give us a sense, Don, on what level of cash deployment or what level of investment securities growth
you would expect for 2021?
And maybe this next one is for Chris. Embedded in that net interest income outlook, how do you see core
commercial loans ex-PPP trending throughout the year within your guidance? It seems like a lot of peers have
been quite optimistic, surprising the market on loan growth recovery, particularly in the second half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. As far as the outlook for net interest income and some of the assumptions we have there for the
reinvestment, in the fourth quarter, we increased our core investment portfolio by about $3 billion. And that was
investing at a faster pace than the runoff. And I would – and our outlook would have some of that same type of
pace continuing throughout the current year that we're currently sitting on over $14 billion in cash and about $2
billion in T-bills that we think would be available for us to continue to redeploy either through loan growth or
through reinvestment. And so that would be the core assumption that we have there.
Just on that component that for the roughly $6 billion that we invested this quarter, the average reinvestment yield
was about 1.28%, so down from what the runoff level would be, but reflected some of the strategy as far as
investing in certain securities and then swapping them back so that, say, 5 years down the road, those fixed rate
securities would convert over to floating rate. So, our expectation would be to continue that kind of a strategy
going forward, Chris, on commercial loan growth.

Sure, Erika. So, a couple of things, as Don mentioned; loan growth first of all, consumer is an area that will
continue to be an outlier of growth for us, and I think we're well positioned for that. Next area if you think about
commercial real estate, we have a very, very good franchise. We're actually not growing the on-balance sheet
debt there, and that's by strategy. I think last year, we probably placed $11 billion with our targeted customers in
our real estate book.
As it relates to C&I, we haven't yet seen growth. If you're looking at utilization, Erika, it is now at or below even
pre-pandemic. We haven't seen people investing in property, plant, equipment, investing in people. But what we
have seen, and I think is a very good sign, and you saw it in our investment banking numbers in the fourth
quarter, is people are starting to make strategic moves.
And so, we're having great strategic discussions with our clients and our prospects and I think people are thinking
now with the election behind us, with the vaccine rollout of really what are they going to do to grow their business.
So, I too am optimistic that we'll see an increase in line utilization and that we'll see people start to invest in their
business.
The other thing that would obviously be helpful for line utilization because if we had a bit of inflation if people
actually started investing and going long in inventory and I don't think that's an unrealistic scenario as you think
about the back half of the year.

Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate the color you gave on the reinvestment and the impact of liquidity, as well as your NII guidance. Just
wanted to see if you can help us in how to think about the trajectory of the net interest margin here in the coming
quarters. I know there's also a PPP benefit. But just want to see if you can give us a lot of color in terms of how
that could trend in the next coming quarters? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Well, good. As far as the margin, it's challenging to predict just because the timing of some of the deposit flows is
also creating either pressure or change there. And so, with our assumption of having deposits growing low single
digits that implies that our margin will come down slightly from where it is as of the fourth quarter, so something
slightly below the $270 million. And I would say that from quarter-to-quarter, that will be impacted based on, like
you said, the PPP forgiveness timing and also the changes in the overall liquidity position.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, all right. Thanks. That helps. And then separately, Chris, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A
interest both bank and non-bank. We've clearly seen some banks there in your backyard move on some deals,
and I know you've flagged competition as one of the risks that you think about, and you can certainly see that
intensifying in the coming years. So basically, I want to get your thoughts on whole bank M&A from that
perspective and then also on the nonbank front? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Thanks for your question. Well, my comment with respect to intensity of competitors was really nonbanks
and thinking about some of the fintechs. But as it relates specifically to your question, we're not really focused on
whole bank consolidation or acquisitions really at all. We think we have everything we need to be successful. We
think the best way for us to generate value is to execute our targeted scale and go out and grow organically. So,
having said that, obviously, we take the responsibility very seriously of being a public company, and we know we
have to go out there each and every day and create value.
As it relates to nonbanks, I'm really proud of the job we've done over many years of being able to buy
entrepreneurial firms and successfully integrating them into our business. And I think about Cain Brothers, I think
about Pacific Crest Securities and most recently, Laurel Road, that was a born digital company, that we've been
able to really, not only integrate into our business, but actually, helps Key grow – helps as both Key and Laurel
Road have grown. So, I think you'll see us continue to go out in keeping with our focus around targeted scale,
buying these niche businesses that can help us really serve our targeted client bases.

John Pancari Q

Operator: Our next question is from Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello. This is Janet Lee on for Steve Alexopoulos. So, my first question is on deposits. You're guiding to deposits
going up even more from here after 20% growth in 2020. Is this a function of your customers still holding on to
cash in their account, or does this bake in any assumption about new client acquisitions from your successful
PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I would say it's on all fronts. And so, we are assuming a growth on a continued basis, one is that we in the last
three quarters have shown a lot of strong retail household growth and with a focus there on primary operating
accounts for the retail customers throughout our commercial customer base. We have increased efforts around
making sure that we have that expanded full depository/operating account relationship there as well. And so those
will be helpful.
It would also reflect the assumptions like we saw last year that as the PPP loans were originated, a good portion
of those proceeds were deposited into deposit accounts with our customers. And so, we would expect to see
some lift from that. And then just the most recent round of stimulus also adds deposit balances. And each quarter
this year, we've tried to estimate where our deposit flows will be. And I think each quarter we probably
underestimated where they actually come through. And so, I think the customers continue to have liquidity and
continue to build those positions. And that's essentially why we're assuming that we'll have continued growth
there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Don, the only thing I would add to that is we have a very successful third-party commercial loan servicing
business, where we are named primary servicer on $300 billion worth of commercial real estate. That business
has grown very, very well, and that generates deposits. And we also from a strategic perspective are very focused
on primacy with both our consumer clients and our commercial clients, and we're getting a lot of lift there.

That's helpful. And it's positively surprising to hear that you expect overall residential mortgage originations to
remain stable to potentially increase in 2021 versus 2022. So, do you – are you saying that the consumer
mortgage income line on your fee income, is that going to be stable? Or is it going to go down like single digits?
And how does it fit into the overall fee income guidance of up low single digits? Like, where are the other like
offsetting line items that are going to see bigger drop?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yes. As far as the outlook for 2021, that we would expect that line item to come down slightly, more reflecting the
impact of the extremely high levels of gain on sale we experienced, especially in the third quarter of this year. So,
we saw that come down in the fourth quarter and would expect to see ongoing pressure there. So even though
the origination volumes would be stable to maybe up, we would expect to see some pressure there.
As far as the other categories on fee income that we would expect good growth in service charge line item, that
those categories were under pressure throughout a good portion of the, say, second and third quarter of 2020,
and we would expect to see growth coming from that category, and especially reflecting the impact of the low
rates. We would expect to see good growth in trust and investment services line item between what we're doing
from a retail and commercial brokerage/account activity there.
And just our overall investment management strategy, we would expect to see some growth there. And then even
though we've had a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees, we do expect that to grow again
for 2021. And so, we've got a good pipeline in that business. We got a good team, and we're expecting to add
bankers to that area throughout 2021 as well, which will help deliver those results also.

Christopher M. Gorman A

So, this is Chris. This is an area that, frankly through the pandemic, we've been challenged to really pin down on
where we think it's going to go. If you think about people drawing on their lines and then paying back those draws.
We're about at 50% in our C&I book right now, which Peter, is a little bit below where we would have been pre-
pandemic.
And I think the real catalyst there is one, our clients are sitting on a lot of cash. So arguably, we'll have to burn
down some of their cash before they start to utilize their lines. So, they have elevated cash positions. That's the
first thing.
And the second thing that I mentioned is there's plenty of slack now in the global supply chains. And so, people
aren't really investing and going long per se on inventory. So, I think you'd need those two things to happen. The
biggest driver of both of those, obviously, is to get real economic growth. Don, what would you add to that?

No, I think that's right. I mean, as far as the 50%, that implies roughly about $50 billion in outstanding balances on
those lines for us. So just to put that in perspective, if that would increase by 1%, and that's – which shows that
1% growth on the $50 billion.

Got it. That's helpful. And then just one question. Just on net interest income, the outlook of low single-digits that
2020 is on a GAAP basis as well. Is that right?

Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I'm sorry, repeat that, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Sure. Sorry. The fee income outlook, the 2020 base, that's a GAAP number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
The 2020 base is the GAAP number, and our FTE adjustment isn't assuming much of a change on a year-over-
year basis there. But I guess, we would have a tax rate change, we would start to see that. But it runs usually
about $29 million to $30 million a quarter – a year – excuse me, a year for the FTE adjustment.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

Operator: And with no further questions in queue, I'll turn it back to the company for any closing comments.
