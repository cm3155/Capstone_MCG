Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Timothy S. Crane
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for the Wintrust Financial first quarter
earnings call. With me this morning are Dave Dykstra, our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; Rich
Murphy, our Vice Chairman and Chief Lending Officer, Dave Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kate Boege,
our General Counsel.
In terms of an agenda, I'll share some high-level highlights, Dave Dykstra will speak to the financial results, and
Rich Murphy will add some additional information and color on credit performance. I'll be back to wrap up with
some summary thoughts on two topics: a high-level outlook going forward, followed by a few remarks on the
announcement from this past Monday regarding our pending acquisition of Macatawa Bank.
For the quarter, we reported record net income of just over $187 million. The results include a onetime gain from
the previously announced partnership related to our 401(k) advisory business and a further expense related to the
replenishment of the FDIC Deposit Guarantee Fund. Dave will speak to the relative amounts for these items and
a handful of other items. Overall, net of these atypical and mostly positive items, the quarter was strong and in
line with our expectations. We grew both loans and deposits by slightly over $1 billion, with a net interest margin
of 3.59%. The loan growth was balanced nicely across all of our major businesses.
Net interest income of $464 million was down just a bit from the fourth quarter; and if adjusted for the number of
days in the quarter, would have been essentially flat. Our strong deposit growth reflects our continued ability to
attract deposits and grow our franchise. During the quarter, however, we did see a decline in the average
noninterest-bearing deposits of approximately $430 million. We attribute this in part to seasonal deposit flows, but
also to clients using their funds to invest in projects and to higher liquid-rate options.
We continue to expect credit performance to normalize from the very low levels experienced over the last few
years. However, our NPLs remain low and our charge-offs reflect to a large degree the resolution of prior period
reserve activity. Despite these modest credit losses, we continue to maintain a healthy allowance. And as you'll
hear from Rich, we also continue to proactively address challenged credits in our portfolio. I would highlight that
our allowance coverage for core loans, excluding primarily our low loss insurance finance portfolios, is at a
healthy 1.51%.
Market rate increases during the quarter impacted tangible book value. But despite these fluctuations, our
tangible book value improved to a record level from the fourth quarter, and the strong earnings resulted in slightly
improved capital ratios.
Overall, it was a solid quarter, which we believe will compare well and may differentiate us relative to many of our
competitors.
With that, I'll turn this over to Dave and Rich. Afterward, again, I'll come back to wrap up in terms of what we're
seeing and speak to the acquisition announcement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All right. Thanks, Tim. First, with respect to the balance sheet growth in the first quarter, we're pleased to report
solid loan growth at the high end of our guidance. Total loans grew by approximately $1.1 billion or 10% on an
annualized basis. Importantly, the increase in loans was broad-based, and Rich Murphy will discuss this in more

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
detail in just a bit. We recorded corresponding deposit growth of $1.1 billion during the quarter, which is a 9%
increase over the prior quarter on an annualized basis.
As to the deposit composition, noninterest-bearing deposits declined on average by approximately $434 million in
the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of last year and as of the end of the first quarter represented
approximately 21% of total deposits. The decline in the noninterest-bearing deposits, as Tim mentioned, was a
result of businesses utilizing their cash rather than drawing on outstanding loans, some additional movement to
interest-bearing deposit accounts and some seasonality. And although the decline in average noninterest-bearing
accounts follow several stable quarters, we're encouraged that thus far in the second quarter, noninterest-bearing
accounts are averaging a couple hundred million dollars more than they were in March. So we're hopeful that the
first quarter dip rebounds a bit in the second quarter.
As to other aspects of the balance sheet results, total assets grew by approximately $1.3 billion, and our
regulatory capital ratios improved slightly despite the strong growth. Overall, it was another successful quarter for
gaining new customers in our market and for the growth of our franchise, which has been the primary objective of
Wintrust throughout its history. Our differentiated business model, exceptional team and service and unique
position in Chicago, Milwaukee markets continue to serve us well.
As to the income statement categories, first, I'm pleased to reiterate the first quarter was a record quarter, not only
from the standpoint of quarterly net income, but also from the standpoint of quarterly net revenues. As Tim
mentioned, our net interest income remained relatively steady with the fourth quarter of 2023 if adjusted for the
number of days in the quarter. And increase in the average earning assets was essentially offset by a 5-basis-
point decline in the net interest margin. The slight decline in the net interest margin was primarily the result of a
mix shift in deposits and the pressure caused by a lower level of noninterest-bearing deposits and higher costs of
attracting incremental deposits to fund the strong loan growth. These dynamics resulted in a net interest margin of
3.59% for the first quarter and a run rate of approximately 3.5% at the end of the first quarter.
Based on the current interest rate environment, the dynamics of the expected stronger loan growth in the second
quarter, fluctuating noninterest-bearing deposits and the [ph] annual (00:07:30) cost of funding elevated loan
growth, we expect the net interest margin to be within a range around the levels where we ended the first quarter
or approximately 3.5%. As I mentioned, the exceptional loan growth that we expect in the second quarter will
require us to fund that growth in the short term with marginally higher deposit costs, which will likely pressure the
margin a bit, but would represent an acceptable tradeoff. Said another way, we're happy to take advantage of
current market conditions and add high quality loans and high quality relationships, even if that means a bit of
margin pressure in the short run. These new relationships will provide nice gains in market share and additional
net interest income at acceptable returns.
Turning to provision for credit losses, Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $21.7 million in the first
quarter, down from a provision of $42.9 million in the prior quarter and down slightly from the $23 million of
provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter. The lower provision expense in the first quarter relative to the
prior quarter was primarily a result of improvement in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, primarily narrower
forecasted Baa credit spreads. Rich will talk about the credit metrics and loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit.
Regarding the other noninterest income and noninterest expense sections, total noninterest income totaled
$140.6 million in the first quarter, which was up approximately $39.8 million when compared to the prior quarter.
The reason for the increase related to two primary factors: First, as we disclosed in the news release during the
first quarter and as Tim mentioned, the company sold its retirement planning and advisors division, which
4

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
generated a net gain on the sale of assets of approximately $19.3 million. The net gain was comprised of a $20
million gross gain, which is included in other income and offsetting compensation expense of roughly $700,000.
Second, the company generated approximately $20.2 million more in mortgage banking revenue. Relative to the
fourth quarter of 2023, mortgage revenue had $2.3 million of net favorable change in valuation adjustments from
our mortgage servicing rights and certain other mortgage-related assets that we hold at fair value. Whereas the
prior quarter had a $9.7 million net unfavorable valuation adjustment, resulting in a positive swing of
approximately $12 million. We also experienced a $6.6 million increase in production revenue due to slightly
higher origination volumes and improved gain-on-sale margins.
Now there are a variety of other smaller changes in noninterest income categories that are shown in the tables in
our earnings release, but these changes were not unusual, and in the aggregate resulted in a decline of less than
$0.5 million on a pre-tax basis if you take all the other categories in an aggregate manner.
Noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses totaled $333 million in the first quarter and were down
approximately $29.5 million. The primary reason for the decline was the result of $29.2 million less in special
assessments imposed by the FDIC to pay for the two bank failures that occurred earlier in 2023. The company
recorded approximately $5.2 million of such expense in the first quarter due to the updated loss estimates
provided by the FDIC, which was less than the $34.4 million expense recorded in the prior quarter. The remaining
variance of the noninterest expense, both positive and negative, offset to a small reduction of just under
$300,000. A seasonal decline in advertising and marketing expenses and travel and entertainment expenses
were offset by higher levels of other real estate-owned expenses and a variety of other relatively small increases
from the prior quarter, including the aforementioned additional compensation expense related to the sale of the
retirement planning and advisors division.
In summary, a very solid quarter, good loan growth, good deposit growth, relatively stable net interest margin, a
record level of quarterly net income, a record level of quarterly net revenues, and a continued low level of non-
performing assets.
So, with that, I'll conclude my comments, and I'll turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As Tim and Dave both noted, credit performance continued to be very solid in the first quarter from
a number of perspectives. As detailed on slide 6 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $1.1 billion. The
growth was driven by a number of factors. Core commercial loans, excluding leasing, were up $267 million, driven
largely by quality opportunities, resulting primarily from dislocation within the competitive banking landscape in our
markets. In addition, we saw $170 million in growth from our warehouse line of credit portfolio resulting from
strategic hires made last year coupled with a recovering mortgage market. We also saw good growth in the
commercial real estate portfolio, resulting largely from draws on existing construction loans. And finally, our
leasing group had another very solid quarter.
Loan growth for the past four quarters totaled $3.6 billion or 9% annualized. We believe that loan growth for the
second quarter of 2024 will continue to be strong and potentially greater than Q1 for a number of reasons.
Historically, we experience our highest growth in our commercial premium finance portfolio in the second quarter.
During the second quarter of 2023, we saw these balances grow by just over $1 billion and we expect similar
growth during this coming quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
We continue to see a hard market for insurance premiums and we are benefiting from opportunities from
consolidation within the premium finance industry. These loans are among the highest yielding in our portfolio. In
addition, core C&I pipelines remain very solid. And finally, our leasing teams continue to see significant demand in
the market. Offsetting this growth will be continued pressure on C&I line utilization, which dropped from 37% to
34% year-over-year as higher borrowing costs have negatively affected usage.
In addition, while we continue to see a number of new CRE opportunities, our CRE pipelines have slowed as
higher borrowing costs have continued to affect loan demand. We anticipate that higher borrowing costs will
continue to cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects, business expansion and equipment
purchases.
In summary, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans at attractive rates and maintain our credit
discipline. As noted earlier, Q2 loan growth should be very strong and in excess of the total for Q1. In addition, we
would anticipate total 2024 loan growth could be at the upper end of our guidance.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 13, we continue to see strong credit performance across
the portfolio. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans was
virtually unchanged at 34 basis points, up by $9 million. As an aside, while core NPLs had a slight decrease for
the quarter, we saw an uptick in non-performing loans in the commercial premium finance portfolio resulting from
increased cancellations in the transportation segment of that portfolio. We continue to monitor the situation closely
and believe this number should stabilize and come down as a result of tighter loan structures and enhanced
underwriting. Higher yields and late charges from this segment of the portfolio continue to offset our credit losses.
Charge-offs for the quarter were $21.8 million or 21 basis points, up from $14.9 million or 14 basis points in Q4.
It's important to note that charge-offs for this quarter were largely reserved for in Q4. Finally, as detailed on slide
13, we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans.
As noted in our last few earnings calls, we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real
estate loans, which comprise roughly one-quarter of our total portfolio. Higher borrowing costs and pressure on
occupancy and lease rates continue to affect CRE valuations, particularly in the office category. During the first
quarter, we saw a modest increase in CRE NPLs from 0.31% to 0.34%, up $4 million.
On slide 17, we continue to provide enhanced detail on our CRE office exposure. Currently, this portfolio remains
steady at $1.6 billion or 13.5% of our total CRE portfolio and only 3.6% of our total loan portfolio. Of the $1.6
billion of office exposure, 44% is medical office or owner occupied. The average size of a loan in the office
portfolio is only $1.5 million. We have only six loans above $20 million and only three of which are nonmedical or
owner occupied.
We perform portfolio reviews regularly on our CRE portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers. As
mentioned on prior calls, our CRE credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every loan over $2.5
million, which will be renewing between now and the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. This analysis, which
covered 78% of all CRE loans maturing during this period, resulted in the following. Half of the loans reviewed will
clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates. Roughly 30% of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or will
require a short-term extension at prevailing rates. The remaining 90% of these loans will require some additional
attention, which could include a pay-down or a pledge of additional collateral.
We continue to back check the results of these tests conducted during prior quarters and have found that the
projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated; and generally speaking, borrowers of
6

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support their loans by providing enhancements, including
principal reductions. Again, our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind
lease rates, but we continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to
identify the best possible outcomes. We believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape, appropriately
reserved and situated to weather the challenges ahead.
That concludes my comments on credit. And I'll turn it back to Tim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, as you can tell, we continue to believe that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the current
environment with our diverse businesses. And as you also heard, we expect to see relatively strong growth in the
coming months.
To some of the earlier comments from both Dave and Rich, if we experience loan growth at the high end or above
the high end of our forecasted range, which we believe is possible, that could pressure the net interest margin
from the current levels, particularly in the second quarter. If that were to occur, the tradeoff is solid franchise
growth and favorable net interest income performance in future quarters. To add some financial context, our
projection is that net interest income for the second half of the year will come in higher than for the first half. And
that while there are a lot of moving parts, the current consensus pre-provision net revenue number looks about
right to us.
With respect to the announcement regarding Macatawa Bank, we've enjoyed speaking to many of you over the
past couple of days and we've also shared the transaction highlights document. So my summary is succinct. We
are very excited about this opportunity. As we've mentioned on prior calls for several reasons, the current
population of attractive targets has been quite limited. Macatawa serves the greater Grand Rapids, West
Michigan market, which is a top 50 MSA in the United States. They have pristine credit quality, net charge-offs are
negative for the past three years, and virtually no non-performing loans. They stayed short with their securities
portfolio, have a limited population of fixed rate loans and a very attractive low-cost deposit book. Their loan-to-
deposit ratio is 55%, which translates to $1.1 billion in excess deposits, which in this environment we would
deploy at a substantially higher rate. Lastly, Macatawa has a committed leadership team excited about the
transaction.
While we have business in Northern Indiana and West Michigan today, we do not have a physical footprint. And I
can tell you that there are not many banks, if any, at this point with this good a profile financially and such a good
cultural fit. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is an ideal platform for our expansion in West Michigan and we
are very pleased to have this moving forward.
At this point, I'll pause, and we can take some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey Tim, thanks for the help on some of the margin and net interest income dynamics. But can you guys touch on
those noninterest-bearing levels and confidence that those balances can stabilize and then touch on some of the
pricing trends you expect in the money markets and savings products? And I understand the second quarter
comments on the margin, but I'm just curious if some of that stuff is burning out and could be less of an issue in
the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we're obviously hopeful that half of the DDA balances that were out on average in the first quarter
have more or less come back and that that will stick, Jon. With market rates up, some of the competition that we'd
seen subsiding kind of is back in the market. And so, you're around 5% for some of the promotional or marginal
deposit growth. But we were pleased in the first quarter to match the deposit growth with the loan growth. And it
came in a little higher cost than we expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, Dave, maybe for you. Can you unpack mortgage a bit in terms of your
expectations there? You talked about slightly higher origination volumes, but typically you guys see a pretty
strong Q2 and Q3. What kind of expectations do you have there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, where we finished the fourth quarter was pretty low. And I guess, the color I can give you is January
applications were higher than December, and February was higher than January, and March was higher than
February. But it's not been like a hockey stick up. It's just been a tick up. And so far in April, the application
volumes are somewhat similar to March, but we are sort of expecting the spring buying season to help. And
although the increase in rates here recently hasn't been helpful, but there is a lot of pent-up demand out there.
We've got more than our normal share of people asking for pre-qualification letters and the like, which does
indicate that there is some pent-up demand. So we do sort of expect the spring buying season to pick up, even

though there is a shortage of supply. And so, we would expect the second quarter to be better than the first
quarter, despite this higher rates that we're seeing now. And we're only two weeks into the second quarter. But
we're optimistic, I guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Sure. That's helpful. All right, guys. I appreciate it. I'll step back. I'm sure there are others with
questions, but numbers look good. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Great. Good morning. Dave, maybe a question for you. I think in your prepared remarks, you said the
consensus PPNR numbers look okay. I guess, what are your expectations for margins? You talked about kind of
a little bit of pressure for growth purposes. But if we do get the forward curve, is the range that you've previously
guided on the margin still good, or is it going to be kind of maybe trending below that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I think it's still good. I think we're fairly neutral now on any – if the consensus is a couple rate cuts, we don't
think that that impacts us dramatically. The bigger pressure here is simply, do you hold the DDA. And we've seen
– like Tim and I've said, we've seen a bounce back so far this quarter. And then just really strong loan growth.
We're going to be above the top end of our guidance in the second quarter, we believe. And just to fund that short
term, it's just a little bit more expensive we're seeing in the market than if you were to just grow the deposits in the
mid-single-digit sort of range. So just a little bit of pressure there. But as I said, we're sort of thinking around the
3.5% range right now, lots of moving parts, but we wouldn't expect that to change dramatically based upon any
moves by the Fed one way or the other, if they're 25 basis points or 50 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And just to – the guidance is mid to upper single is kind of the loan growth that you're talking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, for the year, I think, as Rich said, we think we're at the high end of that guidance. We think the second
quarter will be above that range. It's a strong quarter for premium finance and the pipelines are full. So we actually
think we'll have a stronger growth quarter for loans in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter.

Okay. Thanks for that. In terms of the deal, I think I get the quality of the bank you're buying and the market
extension. Could you help us with accretion expectations or ranges, about 5% of your balance sheet? In terms of
size, is that a reasonable range of what you might be able to extract from it? I know the balance sheet probably
has some finessing to do given they're under-loaned and have a lot of liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Chris. I mean, it's early, obviously, and we're working those numbers, but I think we're going to stick
with what we've said, which is accretive, excluding the integration expense in year one. There's lots of opportunity
here. This a great fit for us. The market's terrific. It grows faster than Chicago, for example, on households. And
we're really excited about this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And the excess liquidity they have, given the strong loan growth we're talking about, we think we can really put
this – to utilize almost on day one in a higher-rate asset class.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Thanks for all that. Just wanted to come back to the prior comment on the PPNR. It feels like you're
being a little conservative given how optimistic you are on growth. Is there something, I guess, we're missing as
analyst that wouldn't suggest that there's an upward bias to the numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Chris, I think we're just cautious about what the deposit environment is going to look like if we have to fund a lot of
growth. And that's a good news story for us that we're going to have good growth, we're adding good names,
they'll be with us for a long time. But growth of – we did $1 billion-plus this quarter and have to do it again next
quarter is causing some upward pressure.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
So, you started the year with record results. Does this impact your appetite for marketing or other investment
spending throughout the rest of 2024? And specifically, I'm thinking about you get an increase in revenue, is that
going to lead to incremental investing in projects? And then also with a lot of your peer banks or competing banks
and risk-weighted asset diets are just coming off of them, is there an appetite to hire some veteran bankers from
other organizations where they may be restricted in their ability to grow their business right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I'll comment. I'm sure Tim will chime in too. But we kind of do a three-year plan for our investments in
technology and projects, and we'll stick with that. We have so many resources. So we want to control expenses,
too, but continue to invest in the business. I don't think that would change much, marketing as – we want to
continue to grow the franchise and raising those deposits is important. So we'll probably stick with our normal
plan, although [indiscernible] (00:28:48) tick up a little bit as you know in the second and the third quarters
because of the seasonality of our sponsorships and the like.
So I think we're going to attempt to control expenses well. Just because we have record profits doesn't mean we
have to spend them. But when it comes to people, we're always looking for good people. And we did that with
some folks in the mortgage warehouse space recently. And we'd always look for good people. If they can produce
good quality franchise value and growth, happy to add people as they become available. But that's always the
case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't think I'd add much. I mean, we've got great momentum as things stand right now. So I think we're
reasonably happy with the forward outlook here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I want to go back to the deposits. Any categories right now where
we're actually seeing some reductions in deposit prices? Can you start to price anything lower at this point or is
everything still sort of turning north?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Dave. It's an interesting question because we're hearing some competitor institutions really with no rate
movement in the market trying to take some rates down. And we're watching that carefully. We've not been active
in that regard primarily because our intent is to grow pretty aggressively. But we are watching some people trying
to kind of trend down in terms of their deposit costs.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire of Jefferies. Your line is open,
Casey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Another question on the funding strategy. I'm sorry if I missed
this, but how much do you expect CDs to drive deposit growth going forward after a very strong first quarter? And
then what is the marginal cost of CDs today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, kind of two answers to that question. I mean, we're running both money market and promotional CD type
offers in the market and getting traction on both. I don't have the exact percentage, Casey, in terms of the mix,
CDs versus other. But the CD market, most people have kind of shortened up waiting to see what happens to
rates, and 7- to 12- or 15-month type stuff is in the 5% or low-5 range. And we're in that category, too. But we're
having good success there. And we're adding new names, which we like a lot. And so, I'd say marginal money
markets are in the 4% range, marginal CDs in the 5% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then on slide 10, your NII simulations, you're actually showing positive, you're showing asset-
sensitive and liability-sensitive. I assume that's tied to the lag in commercial premium finance. I'm just wondering
when does – and which I think that plays out in August. So I'm just wondering, can you just provide some color on
that dynamics. Very interesting simulation that you guys are showing there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Like I said, we think we're relatively neutral. But the main reason it has that dynamic is we think in down-
rate scenarios, we'll be able to reduce our deposit rates pretty much basis point per basis point, those that are not
time deposits. So, the out of money market rate, we would expect to reduce those 25 basis points, if the Fed goes
on 25 basis points. On the upside, we just think the beta is a little slower that we're not going to raise our deposit
prices immediately if rates go up. And so, you would have a lesser beta on the up and a greater beta on the
downside and then you'd have the repricing on the assets, like you talked about. So, it's relatively neutral, as you
can see. But the betas on the deposit is what's sort of creating that dynamic, the beta assumption.

Hi. It's Terry McEvoy. Good morning. Could you maybe...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Good morning, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Maybe provide a bit more color, if you could, on the commercial loan growth in the first quarter? The $670
million, I know you mentioned some of it was mortgage warehouse, the rest was market share gains. Just maybe
expand, industries, are these larger banks, smaller banks, and what's behind that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Terry, it's interesting. I think we've talked a little bit in the past about what's happened in the Chicago
market. We have seen tremendous consolidation at a number of our meaningful competitors like MB and Private
and First Midwest, they are all gone. And so there's just a lot of dislocation. If things don't happen immediately,
they just take time. But we are just seeing a tremendous amount of opportunities as a result of that dislocation.
We're also seeing a lot of opportunities out of the much larger banks that have a presence in Chicago where
they're just not – customers are not feeling a real good connection and communication with some of those
situations right now.
So we're just seeing a lot of really nice opportunities, frankly, that five years ago we just never would have thought
we would see. They tend to be a little bit bigger. We see a lot more opportunities kind of upmarket. And then
within our community bank footprint, we're just again seeing a lot of really good small and medium-size
opportunities. So, the competitive dynamics, as Tim has pointed out, are very much in our favor right now on the
lending side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, we talked about the strong loan production, but expenses look like they
came in below consensus. If that loan production in Q2 picks up and maintained throughout the year, could you
maybe talk about how that will impact the salary and benefit line or expenses overall? Because looking in the
past, there tends to be a correlation with big production quarters and an increase in expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
A little bit. And our expenses, to Dave's point earlier, tend to trend up a little bit in the second and third quarter
generally related to marketing. But in the insurance portfolios, we are very efficient. And so, incremental volume,

while it has an expense impact, is not a big driver. So I would think you would expect modest changes, not kind of
trajectory changes with strong loan growth.

[indiscernible] (00:36:45) credit trajectory for you guys maybe in terms of charge-offs. I mean, you guys have
obviously had excellent credit trends for several year now. So I was just curious how you kind of think about kind
of a normalized charge-off rate for you guys going forward in a higher for longer environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I'll chime in and then Rich can chime in. But we were in the low 21-basis-point range or so this quarter, and in the
teens generally before couple quarters in the singles. But I think we generally think that we write to sort of a 20-
basis-point to-25-basis-point loss rate, and we haven't been there for a number of years, right. So we keep
thinking things will normalize over time. But we think if you're in that 20-basis-point or less – 20-basis-point, 25-
basis-point or less, it's sort of a reasonable range to be in. And so I think 20 basis points to 25 basis points is what
we think of as normal, and over the course of the year, but we haven't seen that recently. But a little trend up in

this quarter, we had some larger ones. But as we talked about, we fully reserved for most of those in prior
quarters. So, just kind of clearing them out and being proactive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think I would agree with everything Dave said. And the other thing I would just keep in mind is it's not
necessarily linear, as you see with a lot of other banks, there is one-offs. So, things just happen. So periodically
you could have something higher. But I think you'll see a lot lower, too. But if you take a look over time, I think
what Dave said is exactly true around that 20-basis-point to-25-basis-point range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then I noticed the office CRE portfolio grew a good amount in the quarter. Just curious in terms
of what type of opportunities you're seeing both in terms of the type of office and also in what geographies as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good catch. Right now, as you could imagine, there is very little appetite out there for office. But as we've
talked about on other calls, we have seen some opportunities out there where they're owner occupied, well-
tenanted and, in this case, these were medical office situations. But you can really get very good structure in
terms of just overall equity contribution and pricing as well. So, we look at it and we don't think that our exposure
here is – we're certainly not over-weighted in that category and we think we have some room, not that we're out
there trying to actively grow that portfolio. But when you see those opportunities, it's great to be out in that market
and still have availability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And Nate, I mean, not that we're looking for office deals, but consistency matters to our clients. And it's important
for us to be in the market. And as others sort of sit on the sidelines, we think we're getting terrific opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. To your geography question, generally speaking, our portfolio tends to be more Midwest focused, not
exclusively. But in this case, this was a mid-Western-based opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just one last one, if I could, for Tim. In light of the acquisition announcement earlier
this week, you guys are – it seems like that should be accretive to your capital ratios going forward. So just
curious to hear kind of the appetite for additional acquisitions over the next year or so, particularly as you maybe
look to fill in up towards the Grand Rapids area potentially?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure. Number one, we think we're reasonably good at acquisitions. So we're confident that we'll get this
integrated and moving the right direction quickly. And we start from a terrific place because this is a really good

bank. We're not going to try to do several at the same time. So, we're probably on the sidelines for a little bit here.
But we're having conversations and continuing to look at what makes the most sense for us going forward.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I'm just going to kind of touch base on [indiscernible] (00:41:32) aspect. Just if you could give us a little bit of
background. I know that you guys have a presence [indiscernible] (00:41:38) footprint in the Western Michigan
area. Like, why do this deal now? It seems like you have a good growth this year. I mean, to be honest, I think
you're – high-single digit is probably going to end up with conservative or probably closer to like 12% growth. This
surely is not just deposits and liquidity. But why do this deal now kind of at the risk of potentially taking our eye off
the ball for what could be or likely to be a really healthy year for growth organically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I don't think we think we're taking our eye off the ball. We think this is part of our strategy to grow in the
Midwest and to take good care of clients. And as you say, we do not have a footprint in the area right now, but we
do have material business in both Northern Indiana and West Michigan. We just opened a new location in Crown
Point less than a month ago. And so, a great market. And at this point, if the question was, do you wait for
something different to come along, we think Macatawa is a terrific fit for us. The growth opportunities in West
Michigan are good. It's a well-run bank. It's a committed leadership team. We just feel like this was the right
franchise at the right time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. And then from the accretion perspective, like it's a very efficient bank, like you said at the
beginning with like other than just kind of mixing the two balance sheets, is there expense synergies to be had in
2025 or is it largely just the pro forma one plus one equals more than two?

Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, there's – Dave can add to this, too. I mean, there's likely some overlap type activity. But we think and I think
they think that we'll bring capabilities to them that'll be productive in the market in terms of both existing clients
and new opportunities. So, whether it's treasury services or digital banking services or expertise in certain lending
areas, I think there's a lot of synergy here and a lot of upside.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And you always get some cost synergies and we should be able to leverage our buying capacity in a
fashion where we can probably drive things like insurance costs and DP costs and those sort of costs lower. And
so there will be some cost saves. But we aren't closing any branches. There's no plan to close branches. We plan
to grow in that market area. So, they're a public company, so some of those public company costs will go away.
We won't need a separate audit, et cetera. So there are cost savings there. But this is a get a partnership with a
great franchise and a great market and grow like we've done our entire life with banks.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple credit follow-up questions. On the pickup in non-performing loans and the
P&C segment, anything timing related? We've talked a lot about credit normalization, but just wanted to see if
there's anything specific in that segment that drove the increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. As I mentioned, transportation tends to be a little bit of an issue right now. Just obviously that's no news to
anybody. The freight rates are down, revenues down in that segment and causes for more stress on those
borrowers. And as a result, cancellations have ticked up, but I don't think ultimately it is a material concern of
mine. I think our teams are working to make sure that we're very efficient on collection. They're working as we go
forward on structuring those deals a little bit tighter. But again, given the level of late fees and overall rates that
we earn on those, it's still a good trade for us.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And the other thing, Jeff, I would chime in there with is they're listed as non-performing. But when they go
into non-performing status, if we're short on collateral, we've already taken the charge-offs. So we're generally just
waiting for that to return premium to come to us from the carrier. So it's not really an indication of larger losses to
come down the pike because if we're short on collateral, we've already taken the loss. We're just waiting for the
money to come back from the carriers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Understood. Thanks. And then just a similar question on the charge-off side, the C&I front. I know you mentioned
in Q4, a lot was reserved for. But within the C&I bucket, are you seeing any commonalities, vintage or business
category? I don't recall what kind of came on or what you reserved for in Q4. But just looking at the C&I bucket,
what was charged off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. In the C&I category, we had some exposure in our franchise group that we recognized. But I think that was
largely kind of more of a one-off-type situation. If there was one area that I would point to, again, it would be
transportation. We don't have a huge amount of exposure there, but it definitely is an area that we're just seeing
not only in the P&C side, but in the core portfolio, just having more stress. But as it relates to the charge-offs, it
was largely focused on some existing CRE exposure that we reserved and a little bit of just miscellaneous C&I
and a little bit of franchise exposure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks, Rich. And a housekeeping on the sale of the retirement and advisory business. Is there a go-forward
impact on fees and expense or is that roughly awash? Just trying to see if we need an adjustment there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's modest. The fees generally go down a little bit as we have a partner and we also lose some expenses. But it's
very modest. And I don't think it's going to move your numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And maybe I'll squeeze in just one last one on that. About a five-month pause here on hedges. Do you
think you're largely in a good shape there? I guess, barring running into maturities of those, do you feel like we
hold or will be in active conversation, but just wanted to see if we got an extended pause here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, we talk about it a lot and we're just kind of watching for the time being. I mean, we'll certainly kind of, as
we get closer to when some of these roll off, be more active or could be more active. But the rate environment
right now is uncertain. And we're seeing people talk about either rates higher for longer or rates up as opposed to
rates down. So I think we're happy with where we are right now.

Jared.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to circle back on the deal. In terms of the timing, that
seems like a great timeline for closing. With the commentary sort of coming out of regulators recently, it sounds
like deals for banks will be more difficult. Do you feel that there'll be an opportunity for you to do more deals going
forward after you integrate this? You seem pretty optimistic on the outlook there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we hope so. We're a community-oriented, high-quality bank. We think Macatawa is same in terms of their
profile. And so, we'll go through the process, but we hope that this gets approved rapidly. And as we talked about
earlier, we'll continue to have conversations and look for other opportunities. But I can tell you, again, no
hesitation on our part with respect to Macatawa. We think this is exactly the right fit in a very good market right
now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And what's the [ph] early sort of (00:50:32) projected credit mark on the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we haven't disclosed that. But they are a public company, you can look at their public filings. And as Tim
mentioned earlier, they've had net recoveries for a few years, a very conservative and well-run credit function. I
wouldn't expect much from that. And you could tell that just from looking at their public disclosures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then you had highlighted the excess funding coming from the deal. If we do see accelerated
loan growth from the core bank, would you look at adding wholesale funding as a short-term fix until those excess
funds come on? Or should we really be thinking that you're going to match fund all loan growth with full market
price deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. We sometimes use wholesale funding to fund the growth because you can never match it perfectly, right. But
our plan long term is even if you backfill in the short term with wholesale funding and we continue to grow our

term. But sometimes you have to backfill in if the loan growth is much more accelerated than your standard
deposit gathering activities. But it's not a long-term plan. It's a short-term gap to our plan.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just finally for me. You talked about the better spread opportunity on
commercial lending. Where are you seeing spot rates for new C&I loans now in the market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's a pretty broad group. I mean, for really high quality, well-secured, well-structured opportunities where you're
getting a lot of treasury, you could be in the 2.50% range, but we're still seeing rates that are still very attractive
and north of that and smaller deals and deals where there is a little bit more structural issues. But generally
speaking, our job, as we talked about, is really bringing these customers in because you don't get these
opportunities very often. So, our bankers are incredibly eager to win these opportunities when they're out there.
I'm not saying that we're going to be the lowest priced necessarily, but we're certainly, if it's a deal that we want,
we're going to work hard to win it.

Great. Thank you.

Timothy S. Crane
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you, Latif. And for all of you that have participated this morning, thank you not only for today, but for your
feedback and insights over the last couple of days as we've talked about the transaction. I think you can tell we're
excited both about the opportunities in Chicago and about the pending acquisition. And as always, we'll work hard
to deliver.
So, thank you for your time this morning. We'll wrap it up.

Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
