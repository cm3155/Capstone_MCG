Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. On the
call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman, CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following
their remarks we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2 you will see a
discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call you will hear references to various non-
GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insights into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the
non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of

today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter
earnings release, our 2021 annual report to shareholders, and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to
publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3 you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that you'll see
our adjusted operating results followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes
enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and
facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will
focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that I'll turn it over to Jim.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release,
Ameriprise delivered a strong fourth quarter, completing an excellent year in 2022. We continue to navigate
uncertainty and serve our clients exceptionally well. I'll give you an update on the business and then Walter will
discuss our financials.
Let me start with the market environment. Equity markets were down 19% year-over-year, with the average equity
markets down 3% sequentially. So far this year we're starting to see markets rebound to some extent as inflation
eases. However, inflation is still at a high level. The question is will the Fed have to continue to raise rates a bit
more? Or will they maintain higher rates for longer if inflation remains stickier?
With that backdrop, Ameriprise continues to be in a strong position. Revenues were good at $3.6 billion, only
down 2% from a year ago relating to the impact of the equity and fixed income markets. Earnings were up nicely
with EPS up 13% for the quarter and 11% for the year, both new records, and ROE continued to be excellent,
among the best in the industry.
Importantly, we're also managing expenses well with total expenses down 5% compared to a year ago. Assets
under management and administration were down to $1.2 trillion largely driven by the steep decline in equity
markets, lower fixed income markets and a difficult foreign currency translation and asset management.
As in previous quarters, our combination of businesses generates a consistent level of free cash flow and good
returns across market cycles. We're able to consistently invest in the business which is strengthening our
competitive position and our ability to deliver differentiated results.
Now I'll talk more about our businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we continue to deliver very strong
results and build on our leadership positions. We had good client flows in the quarter as clients remained
engaged working closely with their advisors and benefiting from our comprehensive advice and solutions. Total
client flows for the quarter were more than $12 billion, which is very strong and in fact the second highest quarter
we had and just below our record fourth quarter last year.
And I'll highlight that client flows were a record for the year at nearly $43 billion. With the investment climate this
year, we've seen an even split into the mix of flows into advisory and non-advisory accounts, which is appropriate
in this environment. We're maintaining an appropriate level of cash balances with good growth in our Certificate
business and the Ameriprise Bank, which is a key growth area for us.

With regard to the bank, we've been consistently investing to expand our capabilities. The bank provides
important flexibility in this interest rate environment and enables us to further engage and deepen our
relationships with clients. Our bank has grown more than 50% this year to nearly $19 billion. We have good
growth in our pledged loan business and we're on track to launch more deposit and lending-based products this
year.
Our Certificate Company has also grown to nearly $10 billion, up $4 billion for the year. Clearly, 2022 was a very
challenging year for investors to navigate the market volatility. That's why our high level of engagement and
advice is so important. Clients highlight the positive experience they're having with Ameriprise and our advisors.
And that satisfaction leads to a strong level of trust which we're being recognized for. And just recently, we ranked
number two for trust in 2022 in Forrester's new Financial Services Customer Trust Index, and that complements
our Newsweek rating as one of America's most trusted companies last year.
Let's look at advisor productivity, which also remained strong, up 4% to nearly $830,000 per advisor in a
challenging market environment. One of the reasons our advisors are so productive is the level of support and
tools we provide. We're making important investments, including our branding, marketing and integrated
technology. We're helping advisors engage clients really well and driving growth in their practices. And for the
fourth consecutive year, Ameriprise was recognized by J.D. Power for providing outstanding customer service
experience for phone support for advisors.
Turning to recruiting, we had another good quarter with 72 highly productive advisors joining the firm. Advisors
are attracted to our value proposition and the strength and stability of the firm, and the pipeline looks good. So
overall we are consistently investing in the business, including the bank, which is helping to drive organic growth
and continue to generate strong results. Advice & Wealth Management continue to drive the firm's results with
earnings up 41% year-over-year.
Now let's turn to Retirement & Protection Solutions, where earnings were up 25% in the quarter due to the
improved rate environment and our ability to invest out. As part of our strategy we focused on products that meet
our risk tolerances. Overall, sales were down consistent with the industry. We're very much focused on variable
annuities without living benefits, our structured products of variable universal life and DI products given our move
away from fixed products. This business is very stable and delivers a very good cash flow and returns. I'd note
that RiverSource was recently ranked as one of the most profitable life insurers.
Now I'll cover Asset Management. 2022 was a tough year when navigating the volatility as we focus on our clients
and execute our strategic priorities. Similar to the industry, our Asset Management business faced significant
headwinds due to markets depreciating in the US and globally, which pressured earnings.
Equity markets were down 19%. With this, assets under management were down 23% to $584 billion, driven by
market declines as well as a negative FX impact. Overall flows in the quarter were $0.4 billion out that included
$1.7 billion of legacy insurance partner outflows.
In Retail, overall we were in net outflows of $3.7 billion, including reinvested dividends, which were driven by the
weak market conditions that both pressured gross sales and increased redemptions. In addition, in the US we
believe there was a heightened level of tax loss selling in December.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Turning to Global Institutional, we were in net inflows of $5 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners with some
nice wins in LDI strategies. With regard to investment performance, we continue to have solid three, five and 10-
year numbers. However, we have weakness in 1-year numbers given market volatility.
In Asset Management we are maintaining our expense discipline while continuing to invest in long-term priorities.
They include our investment research, alternatives, responsible investment, globalizing our operations and BMO
integration, which is on track. We have a strong lineup of products and capabilities, a clear focus on serving our
clients. And as the environment improves, we will be well situated.
Overall, Ameriprise is in a position of strength entering 2023 and we're very much focused on engaging our clients
and continuing to execute well in this environment. And with the strength and diversification of our business,
including the growth of the bank, we continue to be able to invest across the firm while continuing to return capital
to shareholders at a differentiated level. In the fourth quarter alone we returned $610 million to shareholders.
I'll turn it over to Walter and then we'll take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Results this quarter were very strong, and we continue to demonstrate the strength of the
Ameriprise value proposition. Adjusted EPS increased 13% to $6.94 in the quarter and increased 11% for the full
year. Our diversified business mix supports good performance across market cycles, which was certainly
demonstrated in the quarter.
Fundamentals and Wealth Management, particularly in its cash businesses, were very strong. In total, Wealth
Management now represents 64% of adjusted operating earnings, up from 48% a year ago. Asset Management,
like the industry, is facing substantial headwinds and earnings from this segment declined in the quarter. And the
Retirement & Protection Solution (sic) [Solutions] (00:11:33) business continues to generate solid financial results
and free cash flow.
We remain focused on the aspects of the business that we can control. We are executing our priorities, including
investing for profitable business growth, expanding the bank and completing the integration of BMO, all while
meeting and exceeding client needs and maintaining a disciplined approach to managing expenses. In fact, total
expenses, excluding BMO, were flat for the year. Our balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation
remains strong. In the quarter, we returned $610 million of capital to shareholders totaling $2.4 billion for the full
year while continuing to grow the bank and Certificate Company. We have dedicated significant capital to grow
these businesses.
Let's turn to slide 6. As you would expect in these markets, assets under management and administration ended
the quarter at $1.2 trillion, down 17%. This was driven by depreciating markets with equity and fixed markets
down 19% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, Asset Management AUM levels were impacted by the weakening
of the pound and the euro, with 36% of Asset Management AUM outside the US at the end of the year. Despite
the lower AUMA levels, operating net revenues declined only 2% to $3.6 billion as a result of higher interest
earnings and pre-tax earnings reached a new high of $973 million, reflecting the diversified revenue dynamics I
discussed coupled with the excellent expense discipline.
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management on slide 7. Wealth Management continues to deliver strong organic
growth and business momentum, a reflection of our differentiated value proposition. With the challenging market
backdrop, clients' assets declined 12% to $758 billion in 2022. However, we have sustained growth of 4% over
5

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
the past two years. Total client net flows remained very strong at over $12 billion in the quarter and reached a
record $43 billion for the full year.
While we continue to see a solid level of flows into wrap accounts there has been a distinct pickup in flows going
to brokerage accounts and certificates as clients navigate the market backdrop. Revenue per advisor reached
$827,000, up 23% over the past two years from continued enhanced productivity and business growth.
On slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability was exceptional, up 41%, and reached a record margin
of 30% as strong organic growth and higher interest earnings exceeded pressure from market depreciation and
lower transactional activity. Adjusted operating expenses declined 5% with distribution expenses down 10%,
reflecting lower transactional activity and lower client assets. G&A increased 11% in the quarter. And for the full
year G&A grew 8%. Expense growth in the quarter was driven by continued investments in the bank and higher
volume-related activity from strong organic growth. Additionally, the prior year included unusually low expenses
relating to staff levels and [ph] T&E (00:15:14).
Cash balances in the quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially to $47 billion, which included $10 billion
of certificate balances. Cash rebalances have declined slightly, bringing it closer to historic levels. However,
certificates have grown 76% year-over-year as clients are laddering liquidity to garner higher yields. As a
complement to our certificate offering, we are continuing to build out our savings and deposit products in the bank
this year to meet the growing client appetite for yield. As a reminder, the majority of our clients' sweep cash
balances are working cash accounts with the average account size being only $8,000 and constituting over 60%
of our total cash balances. And our operating rates continue to remain competitive with continuous benchmarking
against the industry. This has translated into higher interest earnings in the quarter. The gross fee yield in the
quarter reached 373 basis points, up 300 basis points from the prior year and over 100 basis points sequentially
with bank and certificates driving most of it.
The bank ended the year with assets of $19 billion with additional capacity to grow further. This provides flexibility
to capture the benefits of rising interest rates by investing in high-quality, longer duration securities. These
investments will create sustainable multiple year benefits regardless of interest rate changes over that period.
New money purchases in the quarter were approximately 250 basis points above the spreads from [ph] Wealth
(00:16:58) balance sheet cash. This has been supplemented with strong growth within our Certificate Company,
with assets growing to nearly $10 billion in the quarter and a gross fee yield of nearly 400 basis points.
As we move into 2023 we are on a trajectory to generate growth in interest earnings from the bank and [ph]
growing (00:17:21) our incremental yield while continuing to maintain high credit quality. In the first half of the
year, we are moving $3 billion onto the bank's balance sheet. We expect to transfer additional balances in the
back half of 2023. And as we previously indicated we will reinvest approximately $3 billion of maturities into
higher-yielding assets throughout the course of the year.
Let's turn to Asset Management on slide 9. In 2022 the backdrop remained challenging for both us and the
industry. AUM was $584 billion, down 23%. This decrease was driven by double-digit equity and fixed income
market depreciation as well as negative pound and euro foreign exchange impacts. Flows during the period
remained challenged as Global Institutional net inflows during 2022 were more than offset by ongoing Retail
pressure. As a reminder, 2021 net flows benefited from the $17 billion BMO US asset transfer, which had limited
impact in 2022.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
On slide 10, you can see Asset Management financials reflect the continuation of the challenging market
environment and reflect deleveraging that occurs in this business. Earnings were $146 million, a 56% decline as a
result of market depreciation and net outflows. In addition, the prior year period included $35 million in
performance fees, while the current quarter only included $5 million as well as $12 million of unfavorable mark-to-
market adjustments. As a result, margin in the quarter declined to 29%.
Importantly, we are focused on the areas we can control and on executing our strategic priorities. Expenses
remain well managed, total expenses were down 12% with G&A and other expenses down from continued
expense disciplines, lower performance fee compensation and timing of mark-to-market expenses.
As a reminder results last year include a partial quarter of BMO related expenses. As we move forward, we will
continue to make market driven trade-offs and discretionary spending and remain committed to managing
expenses very tightly based on the revenue environment.
Let's turn to slide 11. Retirement & Protection Solutions earnings increased 25% with strong cash flow generation
and a clearly differentiated risk profile. Results in the quarter were driven by enhanced yield from repositioning of
the investment portfolio, lower deferred acquisition cost amortization and lower sales levels. We remain well-
capitalized with an estimated RBC ratio of 545% at year-end.
Consistent with the industry, sales in the quarter declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as
the impact from our actions to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits. Now only $43 billion of
account value is in products with living benefit guarantees, a $14 billion decline from past year.
Protection sales remain concentrated in higher-margin asset accumulation VUL, which represents one-third of
total insurance in force assets. The increase in investment income was a direct result of the actions taken to
reposition the investment portfolio. In the quarter we repositioned $600 million primarily into longer duration
corporate bonds while maintaining a high quality portfolio. These actions will generate higher investment income
in 2023.
On slide 12, our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified AA rated investment portfolio is
well-positioned. During the quarter, new money purchases were AA+ rated at yields that were accretive to the
overall portfolio. Despite continued market volatility in the quarter, VA hedging effectiveness remained very strong
at 97%, and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong. Our diversified business model
generates significant and stable free cash flow. This enables the company to deliver a consistent and
differentiated level of capital return to shareholders while continuing to invest for growth.
During the quarter we repurchased 1.6 million shares, returning a total of $610 million of capital to shareholders,
bringing the total for the year to $2.4 billion. Our capital return strategy over the past five years has reduced our
share count by 28%.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first
question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. You flagged the certificate growth in the Wealth business, and
that's certainly consistent with what we've seen at other wealth management firms. So would you expect that as
long as rates stay high, that type of shift and that type of growth should be sustainable? And how should we think
about the corresponding impact of the mix shift on your deposit beta? [ph] Saw that (00:23:40) the deposit beta
seemed to take a step up this quarter. And so should we continue to think that that will move higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. This is Walter. So the answer is that you should with [ph] our CDs (00:23:55) continue to see that sort of
trend line. And you'll see that in our bank we are going to develop new products [ph] with them and (00:24:03)
have them coming out [ph] in 2020 (00:24:04) which will also enhance capabilities for our advisors and their
clients to certainly navigate this situation on interest rates and giving them choice.
And from the deposit beta standpoint, looking on sweep, we are certainly – we are up. We are certainly being
competitive from that standpoint. But we are offering a wide choice, and we see good significant opportunities as
we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. And like I said, that's consistent with many of your competitors in the wealth space. So
when we think about – shifting gears a little bit for the follow-up and staying in Wealth, strong overall net new
asset trends certainly have been encouraging. 7% annualized growth in that business in what has been a
challenging quarter for some competitors. As I understand it, it's not really recruiting driving the numbers, but
rather advisors growing their practices and expanding wallet share of existing clients. So what have you done to
sustain and hopefully encourage that trend into the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So this is Jim. We are very much focused on continuing really around having the advisors engage with the client
through this market cycle and really providing the advice they need. Part of the journey really is how do you think
about achieving your goals over time, not just based on a quarter or the market situation in the current time. And
so that engagement and the tools and capabilities that we provided to help them do that I think is paying really
good dividends.
And so as you saw last year, we had a record amount of client inflows for the full year. And the fourth quarter was
really strong at $12 billion. It's actually the second highest quarter we had. The highest was actually fourth quarter
of last year, that was only $500 million more. So we want to continue that journey around that advice value
proposition and the engagement and helping the advisors really do that more consistently over time.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hey, good morning, Jim and Walter. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. I just wanted to start with one
around AWM here. Certainly, the margin expansion in AWM was very impressive, you hit 30% roughly. Assuming
the Fed pauses here, what do you view as a peak pre-tax margin in Wealth inclusive of the ongoing sweeps you
plan to make at the bank? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, it's Walter. What we achieved in the fourth quarter, we certainly see as sustainable as it relates to 2023.
And certainly the cash side of it is contributing to that, but we're also having strong productivity and growth in our
basically core activities. There is a shift with us going to basically the bank, [ph] earnings and Certificates
generating (00:27:17).
So if the Fed does pause, we think we are well positioned with the sustainability of that profitability that is now
basically has a duration play that will take it over multiple years. So we feel comfortable. Obviously, it will have
some impact. We have to evaluate as it looks not just what the Fed is doing in the short end, but what happens on
the long end, but we feel we're in excellent position as we grow those two activities to ensure the sustainability
and profitability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. Thanks. So, and for my follow-up I want to shift gears maybe to Retirement & Protection here. You had
noted that results in Retirement & Protection only captured a portion of the actions you had taken in the portfolio.
How much incremental benefit should we expect next quarter? And what do you believe could be the new run rate
for that business versus that $180 million quarterly cadence you had provided in prior quarters? Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So we certainly started the investments, and we were completed in the fourth quarter. We still have a little
ways to go in first quarter. But yes, we will see that probably what you're estimating the run rate that we talked
about, the $180 million, but it's probably with that improvement that's taking place with the yield. There's always
areas going in and out. But I'm comfortable with I've seen people being in the $200 million range, but it's over a
one-year cycle, so I would say more like the $800 million range for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. So going back to Advice & Wealth Management, again, when we think about on balance sheet
deposits versus certificates, I think both had similar gross fee yields, but how do the rates that you're paying on
those compare? And as we think about those two, are you fairly agnostic in terms of margin benefits to you
between those two products? Or is one more favorable than the other?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Are you saying certificates on bank or – yes, okay. Clearly the bank has a higher margin than the certificates. And
that's where certainly we're concentrating our growth, but we are getting very strong results and we have very
good margins in the CD business.
And so the answer is we feel we have the capacity to grow those two. And that is going to take a larger and larger
percentage of the profitability that's being generated. Certainly we will be generating good earnings in the sweep
activity, but the real growth potential is coming in a primary bank and we will get lift in CDs. But the margin is
better in the bank versus the CDs because of different investment strategies and liquidity strategies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And is there a way to dimension that margin differential?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, I don't have it, but I'm just telling you, it is better at the bank, and we can take a look at that and see if we can
give more insight onto that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. Makes sense. And then, I guess, you talked about an $800 million investment in both the bank and the
Certificates business over the course of the year. Is that something that you expect will continue into next year?
Or any way to think about the level of capital investment that you expect for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So the short answer is yes. We will be continuing it. It's obviously a matter of equity and cash at closing. And
we have the capacity to do that. And it's really, from our standpoint, it is giving us very good returns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And [ph] maybe if (00:31:05) I could sneak one more in on the long-term care business, it looks like you're
taking advantage of extending portfolio duration there as well. Should we read into that as the sign that maybe a
risk transfer solution is less likely? Or is that reading into it too much?

Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, possibly. Listen, for the longest time, [ph] we've kept short term risk where the third year was (00:31:27).
And now we're taking advantage both in LTC and with the protection. So we are lengthening our duration, but
we're running the business from that standpoint, and you can see we're garnering good profitability both on the
claims side as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter and certainly now with investment capabilities that it's
providing us. So, no, if something comes along, it's great, we'll take a look. But right now we're managing it and
we're taking advantage of the opportunity that's there.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Thank you. In Investment Management I think you mentioned about $12 million of negative onetime items. But
even adjusting for these, I think the margin was at the low end of your target range. So how are you thinking
about margins for 2023? And should we be expecting some improvement given the AUM rebound that you saw
on fourth quarter and then the emergence of BMO synergies over the course of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
It's an interesting situation at this stage because of the dislocations [ph] taking course (00:32:36), especially as
you look at the equity markets, you look at fixed income, depreciation and foreign exchange. But there's a lot of
actions that we're taking and managing through but the margins from that standpoint is deleveraging, just like the
industry is. But I would say that at this point, as we look at it, it's heavily dependent on certainly things we don't
control. But for the things we do control, like you mentioned BMO synergies and other things of that nature, we
are on track. So we feel comfortable from that standpoint. So I think there's a lot of variables now, but we are
certainly cognizant that the margins breach through, but that's related to a lot of market activity that we are now
managing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We see – I mean, listen, again, we don't know if it will hold enough, but you've seen some pickup on the
international market front as far as appreciation [ph] incurred (00:33:29) as well as the improvement in the pound,
et cetera. So we think a little of the headwinds have relieved a bit. That will be helpful. And we're not changing our
range as we move forward.

Got it. Thank you. And then maybe moving to capital management. I think for the full year you returned about
85% of earnings to shareholders in the fourth quarter, the percentage was a little bit lower. So should we still think
about 90% being the right target? Or has this come down at all given the capital being allocated to the bank
and/or the uncertain macro outlook?

James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So as we look at it, we've been one of the highest returning companies out there in capital and even last year was
very strong. So, as we look forward, we have flexibility. But as Walter said, we're continuing to grow the bank,
which is going to require some additional capital, but the returns are strong as well as our Certificate Company,
which are all good uses of capital. In the past years, we have freed up capital. We used some of that to purchase
the BMO, as well as now growing the bank tremendously. So, we think that we're going to generate continuing
good free cash flow that we will return to shareholders. But as far as the percentage and rate will depend on how
we utilize that both for our core investments in the business, as we said, as well as return to shareholders. So, it is
coming down from where it was because of those other growth opportunities, but we'll still be a strong returner.
So I'd leave it at that at this point in time.

Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Walter, just coming with a follow-up on Retirement & Protection, the $800 million or so run rate for
2023, does that contemplate any LDTI accounting impacts? If it doesn't, can you give us some indication up or
down whether that will have a negative or a positive impact? And if $800 million is the right number, why was
there $29 million of over-earning this quarter? Was it all back? Or maybe if you could quantify that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. I said this too, that does not contemplate LDTI. We're still evaluating that from that standpoint, so it does not.
And we'll obviously settle on the approach that we're going to take before the quarter.
As it relates to why it's lower, again part of that profitability improvement was lower sales. And so we're looking at
activities as it relates to that. And so that gives a positive PTI in that situation, plus there was some anomalies as
you basically look at with the changes and the huge change in equity markets and other things that took place, it
gave a lift on [ph] SLP (00:36:31) so from that standpoint I'm just saying we're comfortable with what you guys are
indicating in the $800 million range for the year, and we'll continue that and we're getting that lift. There's no
question about it for the investments that we repositioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q

And Walter, does the $800 million contemplate a little bit of extra spread that you would expect to still get? Or is
that more of a 4Q static look at it?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, it's the continuation of the volume of it. But actually at this stage since that point, certainly since we're still
investing, the spread has come down from that, but we still feel very confident in the ability to generate what I just
said on the $800 million for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then my follow-up is how should we think about the fees and margins of the wrap versus the brokerage
flows in AWM? I think your wrap has a little over 100 basis points of fees. The non-wrap is more commission-
based. But just curious, how do you compare the economics of the two, particularly now if we're going to see
stronger flows into brokerage, I just want to understand how that's going to impact your overall margins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So, Tom, as we look at the business, okay, we've had a bit slower flows into wrap, but still good flows, but
you also had the depreciation of the markets which impact the wrap overall fees for the firm. And so I don't feel
that's permanent. As I said, we also had some transaction volume being down on the commission side.
So I would probably say, if markets settle as they are, you'll continue to see part of that going back into the wrap
programs. Depending on what happens with market, you may see some appreciation of that, which really was
negative in the last few quarters. And regarding the brokerage activities, we will hopefully see some pickup in the
commission side based on getting back into some of the contracts that people have again been more
conservative investing in right now. So I can't really like piece together exactly what that shift is. But I would
probably say there's a bunch of dynamics occurring over the last few quarters in that regard.

Q
Hi. This is [indiscernible] (00:39:12) filling in for Craig. I had a question within AWM. I was curious if you were
seeing any incremental demand from third-party bank sweeps for deposits and what that environment looked
like?
And then kind of following up on that too, I believe your contracts were historically priced on kind of floating with a
spread. Is there any possibility of extending the duration on those contracts which would let you capture higher
yield and also offer some more visibility into cash flow while also taking pressure off of your bank?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Okay. So let me answer that. The answer is back about a couple of months ago, there was certainly – you
couldn't give deposits away. [ph] But (00:39:55) clearly at this basis there is more demand but we are evaluating
what is really, from our standpoint, what is the appropriate [ph] amount for balance sheet (00:40:02) cash and
bringing it back on balance sheet. So we have a very good relationship. We've been doing this for multiple years
through [indiscernible] (00:40:10) and so our relationship with the banks, we do have a combination and laddering
of long and short, so we are assessing it, but it's a good situation from our standpoint both from the demand
coming on sweep and our capacity to bring more back on to balance sheet and the fact we are still attracting good
balances in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. Thank you. And just very quick follow-up and kind of switching gears a little bit, I really like your Certificate
program, that's a great cash management solution for clients with competitive rates. I was curious, looking at the
historical allocations from past cycles, is there anything different this cycle that you would say that would affect
allocation that we should be taking into consideration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A

Into the CD [ph] market – yes (00:41:00).

Q
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Listen, we are very cognizant in trying to give our clients the capabilities there. So that trend has been going and
been evaluating as the Fed makes [ph] the shifts and other things and (00:41:12) alternatives. So you're seeing
that. And yes, we will continue to do that. But the important thing is we are also building that capability very shortly
into the bank, which also gives a different set of alternatives for them to really look at their laddering as I
mentioned. So [ph] you're (00:41:28) just adjusting and certainly having the product capability and the capabilities
to grow either [ph] our balance sheet, on balance sheet in (00:41:33) the bank and in certs.

Q
Hey all, this is [ph] Luke (00:41:49) on behalf of Alex. Thanks for taking the question. So, keeping on topic of the
bank, you had a few billion of securities maturing in 2023. What kind of incremental reinvestment spread are you
looking at picking up here relative to what's rolling off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So, yes, we have about $3 billion maturing during the year. So right now, we are thinking in the range that
will be 200 to 300 basis points, so we'll pick up from it. I don't have the exact, but I'll have [indiscernible]
(00:42:18), but we will pick up reasonably good spread from what's maturing versus what we can invest at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got you. Helpful. That's awesome. Thank you. And then switching gears to firm-wide, do you have any thoughts
on how you're thinking about firm-wide G&A growth in 2023 off of the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion base, if this is the
right base to think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. Listen, I think we've always demonstrated we are very disciplined in managing our expenses to ensure that
we are investing for growth. At the same time analyzing the margin capabilities as it relates to it. So we will remain
disciplined as we go and we look at shifting and where that is from that standard and getting the efficiencies that
we are constantly evaluating. So I would say the ranges you've seen is the ranges that we believe will certainly be
sustainable, but it's situationally driven as we manage our expenses very tightly.

Jeff Schmitt Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. In Wealth Management, just thinking about cash sorting and I guess you may be capturing
some of that, if that's being shifted into the Certificates business. But do you have a sense on how much has sort
of shifted maybe into sort of third-party mutual funds or some other investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So over the course of the year, as you would imagine, and [indiscernible] (00:43:51) started last year, you
would have a higher level of cash from clients as they move things to the sideline or et cetera and put it fully back
in the market or even in fixed income, so went into money markets, went into brokered CDs, went into other short-
duration products, just like we have the cash here going into some of our certificates.

Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
The amount of cash we're holding pretty much on transactional is pretty at the consistent levels. It's not where
that has built up tremendously. We just had more client flows coming in and that's just as a percentage. And then
we got a piece of that into our own certificate program as an example. And now when we actually launch some of
the preferred savings and deferred deposit programs within the bank, we'll start to capture even a bit more
hopefully of that.
But new cash has come in and that has raised our levels overall, but there's been sorting all through this going
into those other instruments as well as our advisors look at what that balances, what's positional versus
transactional. So that's why we feel like those levels are pretty consistent because things have already sorted
through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeff Schmitt Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Is that lower than some peers maybe just because of the client mix? I mean, is there greater concentration
maybe of lower [ph] account (00:45:23) value that would...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, in [ph] on case (00:45:26), as I said, I think if you look at certificates, which is actually investing out a bit, and
you just look at the amount in our cash sweep products, et cetera, you're actually less than 5% And so that's
consistent with our history based on the level that clients keep for both emergency and transactional activity. So
that's why I said, I think money has already been in all these different positional areas to garner a level of interest
that the clients want with the advisors. So I actually feel comfortable. Now some of that, I think, will go back when
they feel comfortable putting more back into wrap and investment programs as well or longer duration products in
the fixed income market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeff Schmitt Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Right. Okay. And then just one on the bank portfolio. I think that's mainly invested in MBS securities. But what
percentage of that book is in fixed rate investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The majority [ph] is in (00:46:25) fixed. And like I said, it's in structured. The majority is construction, high AA rated
and certainly at the highest levels of the security ladder.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. My question was on long-term care. I know third-party
claims administration accelerated the pace of terminations. Is that anticipated to persist? And how should we think
of run rate within that now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, yes, in the quarter we had a combination of basically, as you indicated, a strong continued claims
performance, along with basically the effects of our benefit programs and basically our premium increases. But
there was this one-time catch-up because a vendor did get behind. But that was about half of it, but we are seeing
good trends as relates to the claims. And it's typical to forecast, but we think we have all the foundational
elements in there. It's been within our expectations for multiple years. And so we are feeling comfortable where it
is, and we do again get the continued benefits of the programs that we have in place to basically contain and
manage that effectively.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A

...which is garnering a higher spread for the portfolio, which is good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question. There's been lots of G&A restraint across the
franchise this year. But is there an optionality for asset management expense reductions given the lower AUM?
There were some other reductions that asset managers announced this morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So as you saw in our asset management business, we have brought expenses down and we will continue to
really manage expenses tightly there. Now we are making good investments in certain areas. We see opportunity
like in some of our real estate and other areas and responsible investing. But we have tightened the range a bit
based on appreciation of the markets. And we feel that that is necessary and appropriate.
Now on the other side, like the Advice & Wealth as we build up more capabilities in the bank, we're making some
investments. But overall for the company we've managed expenses quite tightly, not just the current year but over
the years, and this is actually favorable. Now we're going to have merit increases, other things, et cetera, but
we're going to look at areas of opportunity to tighten if necessary based on the market conditions. But asset
management is one of those areas that we will be a bit more disciplined then.

Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey. Good morning, Jim and Walter, question about the advisors. You added 72 this quarter. Good, but a little
light of where you were. I'm kind of curious as to your pipeline and how you see that playing out in terms of adding
new experienced advisors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So we did add – it's a little less than the previous quarter, et cetera, but there's always timing with year-end
and activities that occur as you would imagine with market conditions...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
[ph] Sure. (00:49:59)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
...volatility there with advisors. But I would say the advisors we added actually had very strong productivity. So
actually from a production perspective, the amount in total was higher [ph] in (00:50:13) what we brought in. And
the pipeline looks very good.
So I think as you see some of the advisors being added, they're really coming over because we do have a really
great integrated technology platform. We give a lot of great support. They're even coming because they trust the
firm and the quality of the firm. And they really think that that's really a benefit for them for their practices. So we
feel very good about the opportunity to continue here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And then just thinking about the insurance subs, RPS. In terms of dividending capital to the parent
company, the equity markets are sort of a headwind, but then you're doing this tremendous repositioning on the
investment portfolio. Could you talk a little bit about expectations for dividending capital [ph] as the parent's fee
(00:51:11) in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So it's Walter. We have and certainly, as we look at it, and I mentioned as related to the earnings that –
certainly [ph] related to (00:51:25) 2022, 2023, we will manage and keep obviously our ratio. And so we feel very
good about the dividend capability coming out of RPS, but the thing with the change and certainly enough growth
going on in AWM, the bank, the stability of that we also have opportunity, and that increase in the flows of
18


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
dividends to this parent from AWM and still get dividends coming up because even though they're under pressure
for Asset Management, they still are dividend-ing a reasonable amount. So our cash flow coming out of the
various segments, including RPS, is really – we are feeling very good about its capabilities in 2023 as a source of
funding for us at the parent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Awesome. Can I sneak one last one. Just on M&A, last quarter, you seem to think that you were going to kind of
maintain the status quo in terms of divesting of blocks. Any change in that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. So as we looked at the environment, et cetera, in the market, let me put it this way. I mean, you probably saw
a thing that was reported out even this week. RiverSource has, it's like the second highest and it's only up by a
few basis points, second highest return out there of any large insurer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Wow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And so I think you got to look at it in a sense as Walter just said the free cash flow, how we derisk the business,
how even what we have on the balance sheet with guarantees is coming down.
The products we're selling are lower risk appropriate for the client. We have a lot of other alternatives on the shelf
for the client. So we feel like this is a good hand that we have. And now that the spreads have gone back up we're
able to invest out a bit more and garner some. So, listen, there may be some opportunities that come along and
we'll look at them as they do. But this is a comfortable hand to have as a complement, particularly with
depreciating markets.

Absolutely. Yeah, I think we do expect and we will probably experience the same seasonality and that's been part

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then just, I know there was a question on overall G&A expenses. Perhaps AWM is a little bit,
you have maybe more insight into the outlook there given the backdrop from an earnings standpoint. Can you

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A

I think, again, we'll go back to is geared towards making sure we get the payback on that with discipline and as
we focus. And so we'll manage it relative to the revenue and the growth opportunities we see, but we will be very
disciplined in it. And I think it will be in ranges that you've seen in the past. But again, it's situational.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A

Yeah. I mean, AWM this year, remember, we had a bounce back in meetings and other travel and T&E again
coming back from a pandemic sort of thing where we cut all those things out as well as we may continue to make
good investments in the growth of the bank and bringing in advisors, et cetera. So you're going to have merit and
other things that are there. But I think on a balance basis our expenses will be managed pretty well. And we don't
see that accelerating in any way. But as Walter said, whatever we're making investments, we'll get good returns
on, but I don't think that will be at a high level.
