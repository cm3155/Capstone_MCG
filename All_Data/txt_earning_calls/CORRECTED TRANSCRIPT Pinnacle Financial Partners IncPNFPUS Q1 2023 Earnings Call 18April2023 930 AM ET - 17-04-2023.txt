M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning. As you've seen, first quarter was a very strong quarter for PNFP with
outsized loan and deposit growth even in a difficult economic environment, which I believe is linked to our client-
centric approach to the market. Much has been written and spoken, I suppose, within the last month or so about
whether regional banks like ours could withstand the inevitable movement of deposits up to the money center
banks. So, I believe we have now answered that question.
We have begun every call for years with this snapshot of our quarterly performance which is the four-year
quarterly format with intend to showcasing the long-term reliability of our performance on the metrics that we think
matter through the cycle. At the bottom of the slide, you can see that asset quality continues to be extremely
strong. We have non-performing assets, classified assets and net charge-offs continuing to operate well beneath
the four-year median, which represents a period of exceptional asset quality. It's honestly hard to imagine how it
could get any better than that.
PNFP has repeatedly been recognized by Greenwich Associates as having one of the best brands in the country.
According to Greenwich, PNFP stands out in the areas of being number one, trustworthy; and number two, easy
to do business with. That's an incredibly powerful position to own in these turbulent times. PNFP has the number
one Net Promoter Score and a footprint among businesses with annual revenues from $1 million to $500 million.
Raving fans are always invaluable, but never more than in times like these. It's just hard to leave a bank that you
love and trust.
Our ability to leverage the brand to attract the best and most experienced bankers away from our larger national
and regional competitors in ever-increasing numbers each of the last several years continues to contribute
meaningfully to outsized growth. The primary source of the growth is market share movement, as these new
recruits consolidate their loan and deposit volumes to PNFP, decreasing our reliance on economic tailwinds. It
looks like to me that first quarter of 2023 was a dramatic demonstration of the power of a differentiated brand, as
evidenced by a 17% annualized loan growth, 14% annualized deposit growth, 17% year-over-year revenue
growth, 30% year-over-year net interest income growth.
So, with that as an introduction, let me turn it over to Harold for a more in-depth review of the quarter.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. I've got a few new slides this morning, so I'll move quickly through the
usual slides to give time for the new information.
We've elected to start with deposits. Reporting linked-quarter growth of 13% in the first quarter was a real positive
for us. Obviously, growing deposits at a reasonable price in 2023 is a key focus. We continue to build out our
deposit-gathering franchise around HSA, community housing association, non-profits and others, and we believe
we are making headway with these and other special deposit initiatives. Our cumulative deposit base stands at

46% through March 31. The last two rate hikes have seen more cost increases in relation to the earlier rate hikes.
We do have some confidence that our client base appreciate the fact that we've been fairly consistent in our
approach to deposit cost increases, while competitors are, in some cases, just now beginning to experience rapid
increase in deposit costs.
This is one of our new slides. It's about addressing many of the hot topics that have come around as a result of
the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. Could not be more proud of our relationship managers, our support
units and how everyone answered the call when all of a sudden we were having to defend our franchise like never
before. We armed our people with timely and relevant information and they used that, as well as years of
relationship building to calm depositor base that was jolted by the failure of the two franchises, as well as all the
media attention that came with the failure of these two very unique franchises.
As to uninsured deposits, the chart's top left is our trend for uninsured and uncollateralized deposits for the last
few years going back to pre-COVID, the important trend here is the drop of 6% in the first quarter. Most of that is
attributable to increased level of reciprocal deposits that we offer those depositors that request increased FDIC
coverage. This is a product that we've offered for more than a decade. Our firm is focused on providing several
alternatives to support depositors that may require additional support. All in, we've traditionally been about a
median performer on uninsured depositors to our peer group.
And then, hand in hand with our uninsured deposit position is our liquidity position. We currently calculate that we
have enough liquidity available to us to provide about 155% coverage of our $18.8 billion, or approximately $12
billion in uninsured deposits. There is also much interest, given the FDIC insurance discussion, about deposit
account sizes. We're hovering around $80,000 per deposit account for the last two years or so. The table
embedded in the chart breaks out commercial versus consumer sizes and trends below.
During COVID, commercial balances increased meaningfully likely due to PPP, clients retaining more dollars
[indiscernible] (00:07:50) going forward, as well as building cash balances due to fairly strong economic
environment, at least for our client base. As to deposit mix shift in the bottom right chart, we're seeing depositors
move more non-interest-bearing and lower-yielding interest accounts into higher interest rate products since the
second quarter of last year. We're at around 25% non-interest bearing to total deposits. Our financial plan
contemplates further decreases through the rest of 2023, but no one really knows where it'll end up. We likely will
be into the pre-COVID levels below 20% as noted on the chart before year-end.
Right after the bank failures in mid-March, we began tracking our 200 largest uninsured depositors to determine
how they manage their deposit balances going back to just prior to the Silicon Valley failure, call it March the 10th,
through the end of last week. Those 200 depositors comprised about $3.9 billion in deposits [indiscernible]
(00:08:48) with the smallest deposit account being around $9 million. We began contacting relationship managers
to find out what changes were happening during this critical time.
We identified transactions of about $45 million with a brokerage account or a large cap bank under what
appeared to be a flight to safety and something that was not anticipated prior to March 10. As of the end of last
week, those same depositors had about $3.9 billion in deposits, which was up slightly from the $3.9 billion that
was there at March 10.
Lastly, we've been able to specifically identify about $200 million in inbound deposits from Silicon Valley and
Signature Bank. Obviously, those are new accounts that were not in the top 200 as of March 10. Given our strong
first quarter results on deposits, we believe our deposit base remains very resilient, and our deposit growth
guidance we offered last quarter remains intact at high single to low double-digit growth for the year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
The first quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us. We are lowering our loan guidance for this year
slightly to low to mid-teens growth from mid-teens growth. As we noted in the release last night, we tightened the
credit box for construction and certain CRE categories, plus adding the incremental weakening of the macro
environment we are opting for the lower loan growth guidance [ph] that's true (00:10:14). We're also reporting a
6% average yield for the quarter and anticipate further increases as we're expecting more announced rate
increases and fixed rate loans are coming up for renewal with higher price targets, so we should see fixed rates
expand as well.
We're again downsizing our net loan growth based on categories noted on the slide to help everyone better
understand the source of our growth. The chart is comparing all of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. As many of
you know, our hire model requires significant experience, greater than 10 years in the market to come to work
here. Just to reiterate, substantially all of this loan growth is not a new borrower showing up at Pinnacle Bank with
a new idea to pitch, but borrowers that have extended relationships with our relationship managers over, in many
cases, decades of working with each other. This is just not true for Charlotte, Nashville, Charleston, and other
legacy markets, but that fact applies to Atlanta, D.C., and our special lending units as well.
As the top left chart reflects, our GAAP NIM decreased 20 basis points, more than we anticipated at the start of
the quarter. Out of an abundance of caution, we added approximately $1.65 billion cash to our balance sheet as a
result of the recent bank failures. Thinking back, we built liquidity in a similar way at the inception of COVID, but
this trip, we've tempered the absolute sizeable liquidity build, as well as the maturity of the resulting Federal Home
Loan Bank balances, which comes with an average life of two years and a weighted average rate of about 4.5%.
With the additional liquidity we have on our balance sheet, our planning assumption that our NIM will likely be
down through the remainder of the year by, call it, 10 basis points.
That said, our growth model should provide for increases in net interest income. As we entered 2023, we believe
net interest income guidance of the mid-teens percentage growth for 2023 over 2022 is reasonable at this time.
As to credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform
very well. As noted earlier, we continue to have a very limited appetite for new construction. We adjusted the CRE
appetite chart on the bottom right somewhat, so that only a limited number of CRE types are now being
considered by our credit officers.
Additionally, during the quarter, our credit officers notified our lending units that any new CRE loans that are [ph]
particularly (00:12:31) residing on a noted bank's balance sheet will be more difficult to move to PNFP for the time
being. In summary, our outlook for our loan portfolio from a credit perspective remains strong. So if negative
trends begin to develop, we believe we remain advantaged.
My second new slide for the day is about credit. The top left chart deals with trends in construction originations.
We began reducing our appetite for construction last summer, which is consistent with the chart. Additionally, the
chart would also indicate that our appetite is largely concentrated in warehouse, multi-family, and some
residential.
Secondly, much discussion about renewals of CRE fixed rate loans, which is the objective of the chart on the top
right. Over the next several quarters, we will have approximately $100 million in fixed rate renewals, and the
average rate on these loans is currently around 4.5% to 5%. Our yield target at renewal will be in the 6.5%-plus
range.

Two comments regarding this chart. The absolute size of the fixed rate volumes coming up for renewal appears
very manageable, and that with property rental increases over the last three to five years and occupancy levels
being stable, we have great confidence that our borrowers will continue to be able to afford the incremental
interest expense. Lots of noise around office CRE right now, and given what we hear about some markets,
rightfully so. The bottom left shows about 92% of our office portfolio is in our markets. The chart also details
where we are not located. We like our markets and our borrowers. That said, our appetite for any new office is like
zero.
The table on the bottom right details the granularity of the portfolio, as well as select credit metrics. Our credit
officers feel very strongly about the quality of our office portfolio. That said, they are aware of the macro case and
our own point with these borrowers and lenders.
Now on to fees, and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG, fee revenues were up more
than $8.5 million. All that said, we're pleased with the effort of our fee-generating units as we saw somewhat of a
rebound from mortgage, a nice increase in service fees, and wealth management. We also have focused on
increasing swap fees this year given recent hires. So far, so good. We continue to anticipate that fee revenues,
excluding BHG and our other equity investments, will come in at around a high-single, low-teens growth rate for
2023 over 2022.
Linked quarter expenses were up primarily due to increased head count, merit raises at the beginning of January
at a target of around 6%, beginning of calendar year adjustments for payroll taxes and [indiscernible] (00:15:23)
expenses, increased FDIC interest assessments, and [ph] timing differential (00:15:28) related credits and
franchise taxes posted in the prior quarter.
Additionally, we have taken a hard look at our anticipated results for the year in comparison to our financial plan
for 2023, and offsetting the increased linked quarter expenses, we are reducing our anticipated incentive payouts
to approximately 70% of target awards in the first quarter. To reduce incentive accrual speaks to the variable cost
nature of our expense base. Along with deferring projects or slowing our hiring, we feel like we have enough
levers to throttle back on expenses, should we need to.
Overall, we have a bold plan for this year and are fully energized to seize the opportunities we have in front of us.
That said, we have modified our growth plans for this year and incorporated that into our updated outlook. As it
stands, we have lowered our expense guidance and feel like our expense base should result in low to mid-teens
growth for 2023 over 2022.
As to capital, tangible book value per common share increased to $46.75 at quarter end, up 18% linked-quarter
annualized on the last quarter. Our capital ratios remain above well capitalized. We like our tangible common
equity ratio, which stands at 8.3%. We believe the actions we've taken to preserve tangible book value and our
tangible capital ratio have served us well and have no plans currently to alter our Tier 1 capital stack via any sort
of common or preferred offering.
Couple of new things related to this slide, the chart at the bottom of the slide tracks select capital ratios as of the
end of December compared to peers given the impact of losses associated with the HTM and AOCI portfolios. We
are very pleased with the results, given our capital appears to be able to withstand any sort of changes to the
capital rules that may be coming our way from either the standard setters or the regulators.
Now, a few comments about BHG before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. As the slide indicates,
BHG had another great quarter in originations, even though originations did decrease from the prior quarter with
6

BHG's implementation of a tighter credit mark. So fewer of the lower credit score loans were funded in the first
quarter. BHG believes last year's volumes reduction during 2022 would have been reduced by 18%, had the
same credit standards been in place for all of last year versus credit standards that are in place now in 2023.
All of that is related to the significant reduction in the lower tranche approvals, which now are at 0% approval
rates. Spreads did expand in the first quarter from the fourth quarter for loans sold in the bank network. First
quarter spreads were 9.4% compared to 8.9% in the prior quarter. That's coupled with larger allocations in the
auction platform this quarter, gain on sale revenue was up 12.7% in the first quarter compared to the fourth. So,
that math works.
The accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments increased 5.81% as the more precautionary posture by the
BHG management has been in effect for the last few quarters. BHG's accrual for loan substitutions and
prepayments for its sold loan portfolio increased from $314 million to $350 million, call it the $36 million increase.
As the blue bars in the bottom right chart show recourse losses were stable at 4%, basically consistent with last
year.
This is a new slide, focus on BHG's on-balance sheet lending strategy. As you recall, the gain-on-sale program is
sourced through the BHG's bank network as depicted on the previous slide. On-balance sheet strategy is a
combination of several funding sources, including securitizations, negotiation for blocks of loans to individual
banks and other funders, et cetera. The top left chart shows the loans BHG holds for investment versus held for
sale to the community banks and thus off-balance sheet along with the associated allowance for loan losses.
Given the macro environment, and as we mentioned last quarter, BHG increased its on-balance sheet reserve for
loan losses to $178 million or 5.19% of its on-balance sheet loans from 4.59% last quarter or about $31 million
increase. Of course, CECL is still on the radar for adoption on October 1. We continue to anticipate the estimated
CECL reserve to be in the 8% to 9% range.
The bottom left chart shows loan yields for the last several quarters along with the average funding cost. The
yields consider average loan balances and include both HFI and HFS in the denominator. The borrowing rates
would include both borrowings collateralized by loans as well as the firm's working lines of credit. With the
securitization completed in March, the borrowing rates increased to 5.6%, while the loan yields were 15.4%. Thus
spreads were at around 9.8%, which is pretty strong in this environment. As usual, the BHG balance sheet and
P&L is included in the supplemental information. The bottom right chart reflects net charge-offs and as you can
see, first quarter shows increased charge-offs at around 4.4%.
Lastly, as mentioned, BHG just successfully completed seventh securitization during the week right after the
Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. To get that accomplished at a reasonable rate was indeed a great
success for BHG and reflects the significant appetite for their credits.
As mentioned earlier, BHG tightened its credit box particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing
base. This will have an impact on both production and spreads going forward. BHG refreshes its credit score
monthly, always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing base. Credit scores were up slightly from the
previous quarter. So, the borrowers have remained resilient during the cycle thus far. In comparison to other
consumer lenders, we believe BHG borrowers remain well compensated with average borrower earnings being
around $293,000 annually.
Looking forward, some key points I'd like to reemphasize and several of you have been talking about for the last
three to four quarters. First, BHG [indiscernible] (00:21:47) responded to the macro environment in a very real
7

way. BHG is and will be increasing reserves based on macroeconomic data at least over the next few quarters.
Secondly, BHG has been modifying their credit models towards originating less risky assets.
Production volumes were strong and we believe they have great momentum to maintain production levels equal
to those in 2022 for 2023. BHG's new funding alternatives will broaden their already strong liquidity platform which
we believe is unmatched by their peers. Currently, BHG has $1.4 billion in available liquidity to fund this franchise,
with more interested inbound calls coming. Lastly, BHG took steps to limit its head count with job eliminations and
eliminating most open positions, as well as other expense reductions.
For this quarter, we're reducing our outlook for BHG from basically flat earnings growth this year to somewhere
around $180 million to $210 million for the year. We continue to have great confidence in our partners at Bankers
Healthcare Group to deliver strong results over the long term.
Quickly again, the usual slide detailing our current financial outlook for 2023. In the interest of time, I won't go
through all these again. Suffice to say, there's a lot of macro issues swirling around right now. We have put forth a
business case on what we think the Fed will do all right. Who knows what's going to happen? We believe a
recession is likely, how deep or severe, we or anyone else really knows. What we do know is that our business
model is resilient, relationship based, and in environments like we have today, that matters a lot. Our
management team is experienced and we have tackled economic downturns before. We have great confidence
that whatever curveballs get thrown at us, we can handle it and perform in a very outsized way.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.

M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Harold.
So, I suppose it's always true, but it seems to me that I seem to notice that more in difficult economic
environments that investors rightly look for the critical measure that will unlock significant value in the current
environment. It might be a deposit cost beta, it might be the average deposit account size, might even be the
excess FDIC deposit – excess FDIC coverage limit. And any and all of that is informative, to be sure.
But at Pinnacle, we will simply continue to rely on what we always have, and that's a differentiated brand, as
evidenced by our unusual ability to turn clients into raving fans. In our most recent data from Greenwich, we
continued to have the highest Net Promoter Score in our markets among businesses with sales from $1 million to
$500 million. I'm confident that has and should continue to enable us to retain and grow deposits, even in a
difficult economic environment.
Fortune magazine just named us as the 24th best workplace in America, and so we continue to be a magnet for
talent. We attracted another 26 revenue producers during the first quarter of 2023, and we expect to be the
employer of choice for those client-focused bankers that are continually frustrated by their inability to get their top
clients taken care of at many of our larger competitors.
I think that most people that understand our company, they understand the linkage between the pace of our hiring
and the pace of our loan growth. It's simply a matter of our associates consolidating their boat from where they
were to us. And because of their intimacy with the credits, as Harold alluded to earlier, the asset quality continues
to be strong for those credits that are being moved.

Similarly, we leverage our brand and hire model along with extreme focus on execution to attract outsized core
funding. We fully expect the various specialty deposit initiatives that we've developed over the last several years,
like HSAs, like HOAs and property managers, like captive insurance companies, just as examples to continue to
support outsized deposit growth.
Our capital levels compared to peers even after marking for held-to-maturity and AOCI losses are very strong in
relation to those peers. And honestly, I think that that's tied to an experienced management team that's largely
been at the helm for 23 years through all the ups and downs. It was tempting for us, just as it was tempting for
others to deploy excess liquidity in the bond book. But we just couldn't bring ourselves to load up on bonds when
rates were at at or near all-time lows.
In our first decade, we endured the dot-com bubble and 9/11, still produced the second highest total shareholder
return of all the publicly traded banks in the United States. Our second decade was in the aftermath of the Great
Recession and included the pandemic. Again in the second decade, we produced second highest total
shareholder return of all the publicly traded banks in the United States. And I obviously don't know what the future
holds, but I believe in that our differentiated brand and our intense focus on disciplined execution is likely to stand
us in good stead in the third decade as well.
So, operator, we'll stop there and take questions.

So, I want to start first on the comment that you retained substantially all of your clients during this period. I'm
curious after the news of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature failing broke, take us behind the scenes, what were
the conversations with your large depositors? Were they panic? Did you have to convince them to stay? Did they
see Pinnacle as being very different than those banks? Please provide some color with that.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Steve. That's a great question. I think our normal – set aside the crises, our normal operating mechanism
here is that every Monday morning, we are in touch with our entire sales force. And so, specifically, what I'm
saying there is Rob McCabe runs a meeting for Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky; Rick Callicutt runs a meeting
for North and South Carolina and Virginia ;and Rob Garcia runs a meeting for Atlanta. And so, that's our normal
mechanism to be in front of sales force and we talk to them about whatever the important initiatives are, whatever
the priorities are, we give them all of the sales information, we train, relevant product knowledge, all those kinds of
things.
So on that Monday, following the Silicon and Signature failures, we arm them with a variety of handouts, one of
which basically took key metrics from Silicon, Signature and Pinnacle and outlined things like what's the
percentage of assets allocated to the securities, what's the held-to-maturity loss, what's the percentage of
uninsured deposits and a series of those important measures that were intended to demonstrate the soundness
of our balance sheet and P&L versus those highlight the differences between our deposit book and theirs and so
forth.
And so, in addition to arming them with that kind of information, they were also armed with sort of refreshers on
FDIC coverage and what can be done in the ordinary course, accounts dialing, all those kinds of things to
maximize FDIC covered.
And then also, things like the reserve called deposit arrangements that Harold alluded to in his comments. And so
anyway, we armed them, we encouraged them to be proactive, to be in touch with large depositors and so forth,
up being the – I don't think they talked very many people that had zero concern. I don't think they talked very
many people that were extremely panicked. But clearly there was a concern. But, as you know, information is a
powerful thing. And so, I think we were successful in sort of allaying concerns that people might have and
highlighting the difference between our franchise and the two failed banks. Am I hitting at what you're looking for?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, that's helpful, actually. So, it sounds like you gave your frontline staff the information they needed to go out
to your clients. It doesn't sound like there was a panic from your clients to move to larger banks or money market
funds or something like that. And Harold gave the number that of your largest clients you brought, sounds like
some deposits back. So if things now stabilized, Terry, is that how would you describe it?

I would. I think – I had a basketball coach that always said, Turner, we don't hand out awards at halftime. I don't
think the contest is necessarily over, but it does feel stable to me. It's less a topic of conversation. I think if we are
able to get to without further high profile bank failures and so forth, my belief is it will stabilize.

Okay. That's helpful. And I had a question on the loan side. So you guys dialed down the loan growth
expectations for this year. You're known for going against the grain. I'm curious, what are you seeing from peers?
Are they tightening the credit box here, too? And why is this not an opportunity for you guys to use this as an

opportunity to take customers and share? Or is the environment just so uncertain that it's time for you guys to be
more cautious, too?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, that's a great question. I think in terms of credit tightening, I would say it's mixed out there. I do think most
people probably are leaning toward a more conservative stance as it relates to credit. I don't think that's universal,
but I do think you would find it in large measure out there.
I think in our case, it's that – appreciate the question, because I think as it relates to the approach to the C&I
segment, including owner-occupied real estate, those doors are wide open. We haven't tightened there. I think
most of the tightening would center in the commercial real estate categories, both construction and mortgage
product. And so, I think that's really where the slowing is.
So, to your question about isn't this a time to take share, I believe it is the time to take share and I believe we will
take share, but that would be concentrated in the C&I segment with a particular focus on small businesses and
middle market companies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And if I could ask you one last one, I'm curious big picture, and actually, I'd love to hear from
both of you. So, as you guys watch what happened at Silicon Valley Bank, who basically lost or was in the
process of losing 85% of their deposits in two days, right, it illustrated the speed at which deposits can now leave
the system. When you look at that, how does that change the way you think about risk, liquidity, positioning? I'm
just curious, what are your key lessons that you learned from that, and how do you change the way you run the
bank now because of it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Steve, there is a lot in that question, for sure. I think bankers, we tend to focus on the left side of balance
sheet. I think we've already focused back on the right side of the balance sheet. Our sales force – instructions to
the sales force for years was around deposit gathering. We were now back at that and making sure that our
deposit portfolio is as diverse, as granular as our loan portfolio that we believe it is. And so, I think it's gotten a lot
of our relationship managers, the people who interact with depositors on a daily basis, back in the game with
respect to how critical this deposit book is.
As to liquidity, I think we're likely to run elevated liquidity at least for the next several quarters. As you might
expect, we've had several conversations with regulators. They're all routine in nature, but they're interested in
what kind of things we may be looking at differently.
So, with that, I'll stop and let Terry kind of give you some comments. But at the end of the day, what I believe this
bank is getting reenergized around is deposit gathering. And if history proves what's going to happen in the future,
I think we'll be very successful in some of these new initiatives and how our people approach their client base.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Yeah. Steve, I think what Harold said is true. I think ther will be an increased emphasis on diversification within
the deposit book. Same it is the case for you, for me, the principal risk is related to deposit granularity, had to do
with their balances in excess of FDIC coverage limit. It sort of doesn't matter what other concentrations might
underlie that, just the fact that it was over the FDIC limit is what created that flight to safety. And so, again, I think
you'll see for us sort of increased emphasis on deposit granularity and ability to put our clients in a position where
they feel safe and secure.
I'll switch gears. I'll make two points. Number one, I do mean what I said in our original presentation. I think the
power of having raving fans is incredible. And again, companies that fail had good fans too, but they did not have
Net Promoter Scores like we do in that commercial segment. And I think that, as I said, it's very hard to leave a
bank that you love and trust. And so, we'll continue to pound away on that. I know it's lost on a lot of people who
have a preference for financial analyses, but at the core, I do think that was the principal mechanism that enabled
us to keep our clients and keep them calm and so forth.
Along those lines, one last thing different than some of the financial things that Harold mentioned, I think you'll see
an increased emphasis on our crisis communication plans. Again, I think we're great internal communicators. I
think we did extremely well following those bank failures, but I do think that will – and try to enhance crisis
communication mechanisms, because to your point, man, things move fast, and you better have an ability to get
your people armed with what they need when that comes up. And so I think we'll do more work around crisis
communications.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Hey. Maybe just shifting a little to the BHG side, and good color there, I guess, when you look at the BHG charge-
off descriptions, what's the difference, or why is the on-balance sheet charge-off level so much higher than the
losses on the sold loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't really have a good answer for you there. It's a great question. They did not or have not – they don't
go through any kind of special process to say we're going to keep these loans versus sell these loans. It's more of
a kind of a haphazard kind of process they go through to figure out which bucket the loan goes into.
I would imagine that some of the newer credits call it the 2021 and 2022 vintages may be more prevalent on the
on-balance sheet side than some of the loans that have been aged longer with the gain on sale platform could
have something to do with.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then if we look at that 18% pullback that you're referencing compared to last year's origination,
is that a – should we be thinking about that being higher risk over the next 18 months or so, just given the lower
credit standards compared to what you're putting on now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think they believe they're going to have, call it, elevated charge-offs from those E&F charges probably
through the next couple of quarters. When they believe that most of them will have seasoned enough, and I think
they've been anywhere from 24 to 36 months is the appropriate seasoning for those particular credits, that's a –
the proverbial credit losses will get through the snake. So, that's what they believe in a way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just a final one on BHG, when we look at that slide 22 and look at the expectation for pre-tax
earnings. Does that include the impact of CECL in October or would that be in addition to that or separate from
that through equity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, that would include the P&L impact of CECL for the last three months of the year, for sure.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Catherine Mealor from KBW. Your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. One follow-up on BHG was, it seems that throughout the quarter, there was still a lot of
appetite for banks on the auction platform for – to buy BHG's paper. Have you seen any change in that in the
back half of the quarter or maybe in April so far? And what is the risk that in an environment where you're seeing
banks reduce loan demand across the board that they become less inclined by BHG paper? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Catherine, BHG, their management was concerned about that in the earlier part of the quarter. But every
day, they opened up the auction platform, the banks came. And so, that's true through today. They don't have any
reason to believe right now that they won't see kind of a similar placement number in the second quarter. And I
think that here for the rest of the year, they ought to have a fairly consistent growth curve here for the remaining
three quarters of this year, which they'll only be able to achieve with the gain-on-sale auction platform. So, I think
they've got great confidence that the banks will continue to show up here over the next several quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Catherine. I might just comment quickly in simple terms. First quarter was a record quarter for BHG in terms of
placements, and March was the highest month in the quarter in terms of placements. So, it exceeded February on
the heels of the bank failures and so forth. So, again, that's a pretty good testament. As Harold said, here in the
early part of April, it appears to be functioning exactly as it always has.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's really encouraging. Thanks for that. And then maybe switching over to credit, just – I saw your
outlook that calls for the ACL to be flat in the second quarter over the third and kind of just remains as strong for
you. Just curious, what it takes from a macro perspective or what you're looking at, maybe, at your borrowers that
could, and maybe if your loss potential doesn't change dramatically, but just from a macro perspective, what might
make you decide you need to build that reserve a little bit more than what you've got and I'm particularly curious
about the CRE reserve, which is 66 basis points, still below, but I know that includes a lot of different type of CRE
projects in there. So, just kind of curious what you're – how you think about how comfortable you are with that
ACL and the outlook for that over time. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Well, we're going to – we're obviously going to run our credit models around unemployment and GDP
drop kind of the, what may be the change agent for what the reserve could do over the next several quarters. We
do have the ability to overlay to add qualitative assessments in there and we have done that. If we were to follow
just the strict nature of the quantitative reserve, it would be meaningfully lower.

So, we are, call it, adding incremental reserves as a result of the environment and kind of the uncertainty around
it. But as long as our conversations with our credit officers continue to reflect a pretty benign credit environment,
we think where we are is pretty good. So, we don't anticipate a big uptick in the reserve here in the second
quarter, who knows what's going to happen in the third or fourth. But as it sits today, our credits are performing
like we would expect them to do.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the NIM forecast. Just to clarify that, Harold, I think you
said down 10 bps, so we end the year at 3.30%. And then what kind of Fed forecast are you guys contemplating?
In the release, you guys talk about potential Fed cuts or the slide deck rather.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We're [ph] at quarter (00:46:07) – I think 5.25% by the end of June and then getting down maybe one or
two cuts in the last half of the year, which are pretty inconsequential to our forecast. But that would be where we –
what we think our case is for what the Fed could do, who knows what they're going to do. But as it sits right now,
not really sure that's going to have a significant impact on our, call it, our NIM or non-interest income once we get
past, call it, August or September. Did I get your question okay, Casey?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's great. And so, the down 10 bps. So by 4Q, you expect to run around 3.30%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's what our planning assumption is, is in that kind of a modest decrease in NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Well, we think our deposit – well, if you assume that the rate-up environment is going to end by the end of June,
we're probably closer to 48% to 50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just one more follow-up on BHG. So, if I take the midpoint of the guide, it looks like in the
remaining quarters, you guys are expecting a little bit of an uptick from the $19 million run rate in the first quarter.
And just looking at the slides, just what's driving that improvement, is it the cost measures? Because it feels like
you guys are building more reserves and the funding costs are pressuring. Just some color on what's driving that
[ph] improvement (00:47:55).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Casey, I think your first assertion is right. They do believe they're going to see upticks here for the rest of
the year. That could be because I think the reserve build in the first quarter was more significant than they think
what it's going to be in the next few quarters. So, it could be partially that. But right now, their production seems to
be hanging in there. They still believe they're going to be near what the production levels were last year.
So, then, they'll have the kind of the ability and the decision to send the loans to the auction platform or keep them
on balance sheet. They've got some obligations here in the second quarter to fund more on balance sheet with
some of the, call it, the private equity funding sources, but they think they've got to be able – that they will do and
still be able to send loans to the auction platform to kind of get their bottom line number moving more. That was a
lot of [indiscernible] (00:48:58). And did I get through it okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, yeah, I know. That's great. Thanks. Last one for me. Just on the expense side of things. In the release, you
guys mention potentially pursuing cost measures given a tougher revenue outlook. Just what would prompt you
guys to explore that further? And is there like a profitability or efficiency ratio in mind that you guys would look to
protect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we have any kind of hard goals on efficiency ratios. But what we want to make sure everybody
understands is that we do have a meaningful variable cost component in our plan, and a lot of that evolves
around our incentive accruals, and nobody wants to see us hit that. But in the past, we have always when we've
had more difficult, call it, earnings growth years to go at that incentive accrual and use it to help insulate our
results.
We've also got the ability to back off on hiring, if we need to do that. We've got several projects that are slated for
the rest of the year now and the projects probably won't result in a significant kind of cost savings measure for
2023, but they could for next year. So, we've got several options that we could go into, if we needed to, to help
protect what we believe is a reasonable result this year.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, I understand the decision. Hey. Hey. So, I understand the decision to have a more conservative liquidity
position going forward. But I wanted to know what you would need to see for that to change and to feel more
comfortable deploying or paying down some borrowings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think it – we'll see some of these federal bank borrowings and they've got an average life of two years and
a lot of them have lots of, call it, one to six months. Right now, we don't intend to renew those. So, we'll let our on-
balance sheet cash probably drift down some. When you look at our on-balance sheet cash compared to peers,
we're probably little lighter than, say, some of our peers. So, we'll probably be looking at more of a median
performer on that. So, that could have – that could find its way to our – call it our second quarter or third quarter
liquidity position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then also wanted to get more color on the fixed rate loan re-pricing and wanted to get a sense of what
those conversations are with customers and how are they navigating this environment. And it seems like some
customers may be preferring more variable rate loans nowadays. And I noticed that your swap fee income has
increased. So, just some color on that and kind of what that means potentially for the balance sheet as far as
variable rate loans versus fixed rate loans and [indiscernible] (00:52:23) the balance sheet going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we'll see a dramatic change in the composition of our balance sheet as far as the allocation of
fixed rate credit. With the rate-up cycle, we've had a lot more requests for fixed rate lending. Hopefully – well, not
hopefully, but we counter that with an active swap program because we believe that there comes a point where
you've just got to put up barriers around how much fixed rate lending product you want to allocate to the balance

sheet. And so, we're about trying to create more of a variable rate loan portfolio currently. Yeah, I'll stop there,
Brandon, and see if I've got your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q

Yeah. Yeah. And kind of what I'm getting at is that, we could get potential [indiscernible] (00:53:22) this year and
next year. So, just wanted to get a sense of how you plan on kind of protecting the net interest margin in that
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We've got some floors that we've entered into over the last several months that will help protect it. But I
think going back to the last down-rate cycle, we were pretty aggressive on reducing deposit rates. I think that
makes sense in light of how aggressive we've been on raising deposit rates. So, we will lean into our relationships
and make sure that whatever pricing we provide depositors is fair and reasonable, but we won't be hesitant to
reduce deposit rates when we need to.

Hey, guys. Just a few – most of my questions have been asked and answered, just a few more. Harold, if you
could just give some color on the non-BHG fee guide and kind of what you would expect kind of by business unit,
obviously, the growth guide is pretty solid, but just wanted to get some color on the components. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think at the end of the day – Michael, that's a great question. But at the end of the day, it has to do with
some hiring we've done over the last, call it, two to three quarters and our expectations that those revenue
predictions are going to show up, primarily in wealth management and capital markets, and capital markets we
include the swap programs, among others.
So, we expect them to show up with a nice lift in our revenues for 2023. Mortgage last year was down pretty
significantly. We like our markets. We like the pipelines that they're looking at currently. And so, we expect
mortgage to be much more impactful in 2023, or positively impactful in 2023 than what happened in 2022. So, just
off the cuff, I'd say those are the, call it, the three or four areas that we're expecting big things from.

Great. And then maybe just moving back to deposits, appreciate the color on the different initiatives. Can you just
kind of stratify how much they kind of contributed to this quarter's growth and what we should expect from
contribution point of view for the various initiatives laid out as we kind of move through the back half of the year?
Just trying to size the impact. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I want to say the specialty initiatives have grown, and I saw [indiscernible] (00:56:18) of about $400 million
in deposits, since, I'd call it, the end of last year or the fourth quarter of last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Helpful. And then maybe just one final one for me, just going back to an earlier question around you guys
being opportunistic, I mean, your efficiency ratio is in the low 50s. Pretty good profitability here, even despite
some BHG kind of headwinds. I mean, why not ramp up the hiring efforts? I would think that kind of across the
industry, as loan growth slows, there's going to be a lot of kind of idle lenders sitting around, and you guys have
built out some markets opportunistically over the years, most recently D.C.
Terry, if you can just give us kind of your holistic thoughts, and I know you've talked about some other markets in
the past. I want to put the cart before the horse, but anything kind of moved more to focus just given what's going
on industry-wide? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, thanks for the question, Michael. I think in the case of hiring, I think we are moving forward at a pretty
decent pace. There is – I've mentioned, I think, 26 revenue producers in the first quarter, that gets you north of
100 revenue producers hired for the year. I think last year was a record at something near 140, but north of 100
would be one of our higher years for revenue-producing hires. So I think you can see that we're intending to
continue the share play of hiring great people, having them move the [indiscernible] (00:57:58) business to us.
I think as it relates to market extensions, what we've said really is we want to be in all large high-growth urban
markets in the Southeast. And so, the principal voids, I think, for us are primarily in Florida, and particularly the
markets like Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville would be particularly attractive to us.
And so, the catalyst to go there is just really about the availability of people. And when I say that I'm not speaking
of the availability to hire some revenue producers, that's easy. But what we need before we go is to believe we
can hire somebody who can hire a lot of people across multiple disciplines, including the wealth management
businesses and so forth.
And so, I think you're on the right track. I think the likelihood that some of those people are frustrated and want to
have a different opportunity is high. If we find those people, we would go. And I think you've heard me say it
before, Michael, that I'd go this afternoon if I had them. I'll go next week or next year or whatever. We believe
we're going to produce dramatic growth without doing it. But if we believe we've got an opportunity to go to one of
those large high-growth markets in the Southeast, we'll definitely try to seize it.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Scouten from Piper Sandler. Your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Appreciate it. Do you guys have any data on kind of what you're seeing currently on
the marginal cost of deposits? I'm not sure if I missed it, any commentary there, but in terms of new add-on CDs,
other new pricing [indiscernible] (00:59:48)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, our average deposit costs were up, call it, 63 basis points. I think our incremental accounts are
coming in, call it, in the mid-3s, somewhere like that for, call it, negotiated rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. And on the BHG average income you guys give, I know I haven't looked at how far back you've
given them, I know it's $293,000, and I think that's what it was last quarter. Has that migrated significantly over
time to your knowledge, or has that always kind of been in that range as they've been originating this portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Stephen, I can't recite the numbers, but I don't think it's a significant migration. It obviously moves some, but I
don't think it's had meaningful movement, and it's always been a high disposable income segment that they [ph]
loan to (01:00:54).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Makes sense. And then just last thing for me, kind of a lot of color you guys gave on the office portfolio and
appreciate that. Do you have data? I'm not sure if I missed it on a, like, segmentation between Class A, B, C?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't have it with me, but substantially all of our office would be A and into B. Most of it is suburban,
although we've got – some of the larger projects are more, call it, near city center, some projects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay, perfect. Well, everything else I had was asked and answered. So thanks for the time.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brett Rabatin from Hovde Group. Your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Just two quick ones. First on the expense guidance, as you guys approach $50 billion,
is there any cushion that you're putting in there related to approaching that number, or have you had any
conversations around what might be entailed with potential changes and regulatory oversight for that number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Brett, that's a great question. We've not, call it, been investing in areas to accomplish a $50 billion kind of
regulatory threshold. What we have been doing is traditionally the regulators will always – even though $50 billion
might be a bright line in some respects, and right now we don't know of any changes at that level. But if history
proves itself again, they will begin coaching us immediately.
And we'll have, call it, whatever time period, call it, two to three years to kind of get prepared, so that when we get
the start market, $50 billion there, there we're in good shape. But today as far as our stress testing, our crisis
management, we feel like we're in great shape with respect to our, call it, regulatory compliance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Helpful. And then – and I joined late, so you may have talked about this, but on the wealth management
side, I know you've hired some productive or bigger teams on that platform here in the recent quarter or two. Have
those teams moved over the bulk of their relationships or is that still a process that could lead to higher income
related to that particular line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That would still be a meaningful part of the income growth that we would anticipate. The length of time for a lot of
the wealth managers, I particularly talk about the brokers and trust administrators, I think in the case of the
brokers is generally a shorter cycle than, say, a commercial relationship manager which would take about four
years to consolidate their book, it's a little bit shorter for the brokers, probably similar for the trust administrators.
But, yeah, we still have hired a bunch of people who are still in early stages of consolidating their clients from
where they were to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. So, Terry, that number in terms of the fee income related to that, that could continue to have sizeable
increases in the next few quarters, you think, based on the recent hires?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I do.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brody Preston from UBS. Your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for allowing me to hop in the queue. I just have a couple of questions.
Harold, one of them was a clarification on the BHG financials. Can you clarify for me if the provisioning that BHG
does every quarter, is that just related to the on-balance sheet loans that they have or is that related to any like
first loss kind of position that they have from the loans they sell as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No. It's all related to the loans that are on their balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I ask just because when you kind of back into, if you use the [indiscernible] (01:05:47) disclosure and the
provision disclosure, you can kind of back into the charge-offs and the charge-offs the last couple of quarters, at
least from an annualized rate perspective, are kind of in the mid-teens levels. And over the last four quarters,
they've averaged about 12.5%. And so one of the two-part question on that is, what's kind of causing the elevated
charge-off rate in a relatively strong economic environment? And secondly, if 12.5% of the average charge-off
rate over the last four quarters, why is an 8% to 9% kind of reserve ratio make sense, just given how the CECL
accounting typically works?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know – I don't compute the 12%, but there are elevated charge-offs or those E&F charges from 2020
and 2021 that are coming for this year. That's why they believe that over the next couple of quarters, we should
see some relief from those charge-offs.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for let me jump in here. Just two things for me. Harold, just to clarify, your
outlook or just kind of margin conversation, the 10 basis points. Does that include the reduction or kind of how are
you thinking about that, the liquidity you put on? I mean, the timing, does that contemplate your full reduction in
that liquidity or I know you said you're going to keep it on for a bit, so just trying to understand that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. As far as where we are today, we think about half of that will be gone by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Half will be gone. So the half that's in this – the kind of the guide this year and then there's more that come
next year and then just kind of the end of period, kind of March margin, inclusive of that liquidity. Can you give a
little bit of thought on where we ended March versus the quarter on the margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Oh, the March margin was around, I think, 3.48% or something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So, a little bit below it. Okay. And then just I think you talked about – maybe I'm, if I heard it right that the
continued migration on the deposit side maybe being the non-interest bearing, maybe being below 20% by the
end of the year. Just kind of in that context, just the specialty deposits that, the initiatives you guys have in place.
A, is that 20% what you said or this is accurate, just if I heard it right? And then just as far as how much
contribution you expect in 2023 from these specialty initiatives relative to kind of – if you're looking at 10% deposit
growth, how much of the specialty the new initiatives kind of contribute to that 10% this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the target that we've handed the, call it, the leadership around those, the path or around those
special initiatives is somewhere around, call it, $2 billion in growth this year. So, we're hoping that where they are
thus far, that they'll be able to get to that number as – Brian, did that get to your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Yeah. I think the only thing you can clarify in that 20% number, Harold, if that 20% PDA is kind of where
you think you're trending toward by year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, who knows where we're going to end up. But that's the planning assumption that we're building, or that
we're using.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Okay. Got you. Okay. And then just the last one, Harold, just on the -back to the margin for just a moment. The
outlook, if you do see rate cuts later in the year, it sounds like you have some floors in place. So, I mean, probably
not much of a change or just how does the margin outlook with potential rate cuts. And I guess that's what it
sounds like you have kind of in the – in kind of your planning assumption at the moment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
