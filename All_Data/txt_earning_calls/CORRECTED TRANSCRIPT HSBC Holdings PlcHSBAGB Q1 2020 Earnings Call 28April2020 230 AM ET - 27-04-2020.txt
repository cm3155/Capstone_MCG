Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you and good morning in London and good afternoon in Hong Kong, thank you for joining us. I've got Ewen
with me today, and he will present the numbers in detail before we go to Q&A.
Let me start by saying that these are clearly unprecedented and challenging times for society, for our customers,
and for our people all over the world. The Covid-19 pandemic is testing us all in ways we could never have
anticipated and is causing huge disruption, stress, and uncertainty. HSBC has a massive role to play in
supporting our communities, providing stability, and helping to rebuild economic growth. That purpose has been
true throughout our history and remains true today. We are determined to play our part to the very best of our
ability.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
I'd like to pay tribute to the extraordinary work that our people have done and are doing for our customers and for
each other, each and every day. I have been humbled by their dedication and commitment. Our operations have
been highly resilient with around 80% of our branches open for business, more than 90% of our staff working from
home, and a high degree of business continuity. Since the start of the year we have issued more than 28,000
additional laptops to enable our colleagues to work from home. We have increased our VPN capacity from
118,000 to 250,000 and enabled more than 80% of our contact center stuff to work remotely. This has enabled us
to react quickly and effectively in support of our customers. We have introduced a broad range of customer
support measures and have worked very closely with governments and regulators to channel state support to the
real economy quickly and efficiently.
In Hong Kong, we have approved more than HKD 30 billion of immediate liquidity relief to businesses facing
market uncertainty and supply chain pressures. We have granted more than 80% of our eligible Hong Kong
Commercial Banking clients a pre-approved extension to their import trade loan facilities. And we have put in
place a dedicated 100 strong team to proactively identify eligible businesses and process applications to the Hong
Kong government's 100% Loan Guarantee Scheme with thousands of applications underway after the first week
of operation.
In the UK, we have granted more than 118,000 applications for retail payment holidays and approved more than
£1.9 billion of Covid-19-related financial support for small- and medium-sized businesses. We have been heavily
involved in the UK CBIL Scheme, approving more than 4,200 applications worth over £600 million. That's around
17% of all CBILS lending by accredited lenders, which has nearly doubled our market share for SME lending in
the UK. In total, we have grown group lending by $41 billion and seeing $47 billion of deposit growth in the
quarter.
As far as the plans we announced in February are concerned, our intention is to continue to improve the long-
term capital and operational efficiency of the bank. In the short term, we have decided to pause the vast majority
of redundancies associated with this program when notices have not already been issued. Continuing with our job
reduction programs in the current environment would simply not be appropriate at a time of significant stress for
our people and communities. We are proceeding in other areas as planned, including the combination of our
wholesale back-office operations and the combination of Retail Banking and Wealth Management with Global
Private Banking. We have invested a further $1.2 billion in business growth and digital in the quarter and
accelerated our digital plans to improve customer access during the current crisis. We are also applying the
lessons of the last few weeks, particularly from parts of the business that have responded to a fast-moving
situation with exceptional pace and agility. We will press ahead with our transformation thoughtfully and
purposefully while doing everything necessary to safeguard the well-being of our customers and our people.
There will be no let-up and will move at pace wherever we can.
As you know, in response to a direct request from the Bank of England, the board canceled the payments of our
fourth quarter dividend of 2019. The board also decided that until the end of 2020, we will make no quarterly or
interim dividend payments or accruals in respect of ordinary shares. We will review our dividend policy at or
ahead of our 2020 year-end results.
Turning to our performance, we had a good start to the year with a solid January and February. But in March, the
spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices had a sizeable impact on our first quarter numbers. The
resulting increase in expected credit loss provisions contributed to a 48% drop in reported pre-tax profit and a
51% fall in adjusted profits compared with the same period last year. The impact of fall in markets and volatile
income streams in insurance manufacturing and Global Banking and Markets led to a 5% fall in reported revenue.
Generally though, our businesses showed good resilience, particularly in Asia, while Retail Banking, Global
3

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Markets, and Global Private Banking all grew revenue compared with last year's first quarter. We maintained
good cost control with a drop in adjusted operating expenses of 3%. And our balance sheet remains robust, with a
CET1 ratio of 14.6% and strong liquidity and funding at the end of the first quarter.
Turning to some of our performance highlights in the quarter. We added more than 100,000 Retail Banking
customers and grew retail deposits by more than $13 billion worldwide. We also enhanced our digital capabilities
to serve more customers remotely, to accelerate verification, and to improve our ability to get our customers the
products they need during the current crisis.
Commercial Banking lending balances saw a good growth largely due to client drawdowns on existing facilities
and trade finance business showed great resilience particularly in Asia. And our recently upgraded HSBCnet
treasury management platform for businesses saw a substantial increase in activity with downloads of the mobile
app up 32% and a 97% rise in the volume of mobile payments both of which stand us in good stead for the future.
Global Private Banking added a further $5.3 billion of net new money in the quarter, bringing the total over the last
12 months to $17.7 billion. And Global Banking and Markets did an excellent job keeping capital flowing to our
customers, leading on more than $685 billion of financing for clients in the capital markets globally. With respect
to social and Covid response bonds, we helped our clients raise $19.9 billion to support the Covid-19 relief effort.
We were at the forefront in reopening the global debt capital markets, achieving a Top 2 bookrunner position for
international bonds in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia ex-Japan, and we provided sustained access to equity
capital markets for our customers, achieving a leadership position in Asia, ex-Japan and ex-A-share, and raising
more equity capital for UK listed corporates than any other bank since the start of the year.
I'm pleased with the way the business has responded in support of our customers, and we continue to work
extremely hard to meet the significantly increased funding demands we are seeing across many parts of the bank.
We know that the rest of 2020 will be immensely challenging, but we face it with a resilient business and strong
capital and liquidity.
With that, I'll pass it over to Ewen to go through the numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. Compared with the last year's first quarter, it was clearly a
much tougher quarter, a 48% fall in reported pre-tax profits and a 51% drop in adjusted pre-tax profits. We had a
decent January and February, but March was heavily impacted by Covid-19 and the fall in oil prices. And the
outlook has significantly deteriorated since our February 18 business update.
Certain parts of our business continue to perform well in the quarter, including our resilient performance in our
Hong Kong and broader Asian franchises, the continuing turnaround of Global Private Banking, and a strong
quarter for fixed income and currencies trading revenues in Global Markets. But our results were heavily impacted
by the sharp fall in equity markets, the widening of credit spreads and much higher expected credit losses.
Net volatile items were $1.6 billion adverse to the first quarter of last year. The prudent valuation adjustment
against core tier 1 was $0.5 billion higher than the previous quarter and expected credit losses were $3 billion or
118 basis points of gross loans. Overall, adjusted revenues were down 6% against last year's first quarter, but up
if you exclude volatile items. Net interest income grew by 3% overall, while non-interest income reduced by 16%.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
We started to take action on costs to adjust for the weakened revenue environment. Our adjusted costs fell by 3%
against the first quarter of last year, reflecting a reduced accrual for variable pay and various lower discretionary
cost items. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.44 includes $0.17 of our own credit adjustments or
reserves. That's a $0.29 move quarter-on-quarter from a negative $0.12 at year-end.
Turning to revenue on slide 5, total adjusted revenues in the first quarter were $13.3 billion. That's down 6% on
the first quarter in 2019, but up 6% excluding volatile items. Looking across the four global businesses, in Retail
Banking and Wealth Management, revenues were down 17%, but stable before negative market impacts in
insurance manufacturing. Retail Banking revenues grew by 1%, driven by higher customer deposits, but Wealth
Management revenues were down 52% heavily impacted by a $872 million negative movement in market impacts
in insurance manufacturing. However, investment distribution revenues grew 4% as a result of strong Hong Kong
trading activity.
Global Private Banking revenues were up 13%, underpinned by another strong net new money performance and
higher customer activity levels in the quarter. Commercial Banking revenues were down 5% with global liquidity
and cash management down 10% due to lower interest rates; Credit and Lending up 3%, reflecting growth in
lending balances; and trade finance up 2%, a resilient performance particularly in Asia.
Within Global Banking and Markets, while revenues were down 8% overall, Global Markets grew 25% with a
strong performance in fixed income and currencies trading up 38%. Against this were adverse movements of
$392 million in credit and funding valuation adjustments and $313 million in bid-offer adjustments. While our
Principal Investments business made a loss of $235 million in the quarter. In Corporate Centre, revenues were up
$634 million, balance sheet management was up $221 million due to gains on disposals and we had a $209
million increase in favorable fair value movements on our own long-term debt and associated swaps.
On slide 6, net interest income was $7.6 billion. That's stable against the fourth quarter of 2019. Our net interest
margin was 154 basis points. That's down 2 basis points on the fourth quarter. That's included a combined 2-
basis-point adverse impact from margin compression, reflecting lower rates and hyperinflation in Argentina, and a
1-basis-point favorable impact from lower customer redress costs in the UK ring-fenced bank. Given the drop in
interest rates since the start of the year, around 100 basis points globally, we expect an impact on net interest
income of more than $3 billion in 2020, which is greater than our February guidance at our full-year 2019 results.
Turning to slide 7, adjusted costs were 3% lower than the first quarter in 2019 and that's despite a further $1.2
billion of investment in business growth and digital. Where we can we've begun to take action on costs, including
a $359 million lower accrual for variable pay, the start of a material reduction in the approximately $400 million we
spent last year on travel and entertainment and discipline across various other discretionary cost line items.
We now expect full-year 2020 costs to be below 2019's run rate with a degree of reduction in some line items
dependent on various factors, including group profitability, which could drive further cuts to the variable pay
accrual in the coming quarters and the impact on activity levels in our operations as a result of Covid-19. And due
to the current pause in parts of our transformation plan, we also expect to spend less on costs to achieve in 2020
than previously guided.
On the next slide, we saw a substantially higher credit cost provisions in the first quarter, some $3 billion or 118
basis points of gross loans. This reflected extra charges across all global businesses and regions, largely
reflecting to the changed forward economic outlook [ph] as it accounts (18:21) of Covid-19 and the falling oil price.
Around half of first quarter, expected credit losses were for Stage 3 exposures with all of the Stage 3 increase
5

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
coming in wholesale, including a significant charge in Commercial Banking related to a corporate exposure in
Singapore as well as charges in Global Banking and Markets relating to a small number of clients.
As you can see, we have provided a range for group expected credit losses of $7 billion to $11 billion for 2020.
The midpoint of that range is based on the $3 billion charge for first quarter 2020 plus $2 billion for the rest of
2020 based on the historic average run rate, plus a further $4 billion representing the incremental expected credit
losses from 100% weighting of our severe scenario, which is disclosed in the earnings release.
The bottom-end of the range represents a milder economic scenario than our severe scenario with an economic
recovery commencing in the second half of 2020. And the top-end of the range represents an economic scenario
worse than our current severe scenario extending into 2021.
We will no doubt update our thinking here as we go through the year. There is a wide range of potential
outcomes, including the risk at the upper-end of the range may increase. And I would encourage you in that
regard to read our Covid-19 risk factor in the earnings release.
Turning to slide 9, both customer loans and advances in customer deposits saw a good headline growth. On a
constant currency basis since the end of last year, customer loans and advances grew by $41 billion or 4% and
customer deposits grew by $47 billion or 3%. Part of this growth came from customers in Commercial Banking
and Global Banking and Markets as a result of both drawing down on committed credit line facilities and then
partially redeploying these funds into their deposit accounts to increase their cash reserves. This continues the
trends of the past several quarters where we've seen consistently good volume growth across the customer
franchises and resilient performances in key areas such as trade financing and cash management. Our funding
and liquidity ratios remain robust. We continue to have a low and stable loan-to-deposit ratio and significant
excess high quality liquid assets.
On slide 10, our core tier 1 ratio at the end of first quarter was 14.6%. That's down 10 basis points from the end of
2019. The cancellation of the fourth quarter dividend in 2019 added 40 basis points to our core tier 1 ratio. This
and the decision to not pay an interim dividend in this quarter offset the negative impacts of lower profitability, FX
movements and an increased prudent valuation adjustment.
Risk-weighted assets rose by $13.7 billion in the quarter. This was primarily due to loan growth, partially offset by
FX movements due to the strong US dollar. We've seen limited impact from price cyclicality so far, less than $5
billion of movements from changes in credit quality in the first quarter. However, we currently expect price
cyclicality impacts to increase materially during 2020, hence, our guidance on expecting mid- to high-single-digit
RWA growth for the year as a whole.
As a result, we expect our core tier 1 ratio to decline in the coming quarters and we're comfortable, if necessary,
falling below our 14% target over 2020 and 2021 as we progress through the price cyclical impacts of Covid-19
while retaining capital capacity to continue to support our customers.
So, in summary, a good January and February and a difficult March. The combined impact of Covid-19 and lower
oil prices has significantly impacted some of our businesses while others have proved fairly resilient. Then just the
forward economic guidance coupled with certain Stage 3 exposures caused a significant spike in expected credit
loss provisions, and we expected credit losses to remain elevated over the remainder of the year with a broad
range of outcomes foreseeable depending on the economic impact of Covid-19.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
We were there for our customers in the quarter with good volume growth in both lending and deposits. We've
begun to take necessary action on costs and retain some capacity to partially offset a further drop in revenue
across the coming quarters. Our liquidity and funding ratios remain robust, providing our customers with stability
during the current disruption. But the economic outlook for the remainder of the year is expected to now be much
weaker than previously guided at our full-year 2019 results. We'll continue to monitor the impact of the Covid-19
crisis and review our financial performance and business plan accordingly. At the same time, we'll continue to
assess the appropriateness of our 2022 financial targets, and we'll review our dividend policy after or ahead of our
full-year 2020 results.
We're not expecting the next three quarters to be easy, but we enter this difficult period with strong capital and
liquidity, a strong and resilient franchise, particularly in Asia, an ability to invest in the business, while also
managing cost down, and a commitment to continue to build for the future while responding to the needs of our
customers in the present.
With that, Sharon, if we could please open up for questions?

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Firstly on the Hong Kong ECL charge of $133 million, it didn't have some of the same movement as you saw
elsewhere and it's kind of in line with the 2019 run rates. Just any comments as to what's driving that business
mix and I guess what your outlook is for that market firstly.
And then secondly on the line drawdown, so right now that's translating through to deposit growth, but are there
going to be any earnings associated with these drawdowns? And if so, are these baked into your guidance
around things like net interest income, et cetera? Thanks much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Joseph, thank you. I'll take the second question first if I can, and then pass on to Ewen for the first question. With
respect to the drawdowns, yes, we do anticipate there being earnings associated with those drawdowns. And that
will therefore help mitigate some of the impacts of the rates effects on the deposit book.

And just a quick comment on your first question, I think what we've seen in the first quarter is the resilience of
Hong Kong again as a business and as a customer base. Clearly, there are uncertainties on the horizon with
respect to coronavirus and Covid-19 and how it will develop. But we've been very pleased with the resilience of
the Hong Kong customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
But in terms of the ECL charge in the quarter, it did benefit from the release of around $70 million of overlays. As
you recall during the second half of last year, we did build up fairly reasonable overlays in relation to the Hong
Kong book given what we could see at the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Yeah. Okay. It makes sense. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Fahed Kunwar from Redburn. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Morning, Noel. Morning, Ewen.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
I just had a couple of questions, one was on NIM. I think in your sensitivity guidance, you talk about kind of
[indiscernible] (27:45) the loss on revenues [indiscernible] (27:48). So, for the $3 billion or greater than $3 billion
hit to NII that you flagged in 2020, in terms of 2021 and 2022 assuming rates where they are, did that hit to NII
continue to build or have you baked in all of the hits into 2020 in that kind of 15 basis point margin hit? That was
the first question.
And the second question was on credit RWA inflation, could you just give a bit more color on this? I guess the
PRA was talking about kind of – look at the shock as temporary. If I look at some of your peers, their credit
migration hasn't been as strong and US peers credit migration wasn't as strong either. What's really driven the
cyclical kind of increase in RWA inflation that you're guiding to now for the full year?
And if you don't mind just a third question on credit card spending as well, has a lot of those credit card activity
being people kind of maxing out their maximum kind of credit allowance and do you think that will continue
throughout the course of the year on the credit card book? Thank you.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
I'll pick up the credit card quickly. We've seen a significant reduction in credit card activity over the last two or
three months. I think we're down – seen a reduction in spending of around about 40%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, it's actually the reverse of what you've just said. People are not maxing out their credit cards. What
they're actually doing is not spending and the balances are actually coming down at the moment.
On net interest income, I think you should expect, as per the tables that we previously provided, that there will
continue to be impacts from the lower rate environment if this was to persist into 2021 and 2022 as you continue
to get the progressive cumulative impact of those lower interest rates. What I would say is, though, that the
interest rate sensitivity of the bank, we do have quite a short-dated book, particularly in Hong Kong, both on the
asset side and liability side. The trade book is relatively short-dated. So, you do see a very meaningful impact in
year one, which we're signaling with the $3 billion and then the impact is progressively substantially less in the
subsequent years.
On credit rating migration, I'm not sure about the peer comparisons. If you look at Q1 rating – the impact of ratings
migration was less than $5 billion in terms of the uplift in RWAs. I think what we're signaling for the full year
though that the bulk of that uplift that we're now talking about mid- to high-single digits will be as a result of
expected credit rating migrations. We provided you I think some disclosure in the past on the book that you can
run numbers on, but you should assume that the bulk of that uplift is because of anticipated ratings migration over
the final three quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And you normally have a lag effect of 6 to 12 months. It starts to feed in as companies update their financial
reporting. So, there is normally a lag effect on credit rating migration and we've just given you guidance on that's
still to come.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
But, I mean, consistent with the guidance around expected credit losses, there is a broad range around that
estimate in the same way there is around expected credit loss estimate for the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
No, of course, that's fair enough. Thank you very much. Cheers.

Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Can I just have a few on RWAs please and then maybe a quick one on costs as well. Could you just confirm the
base figure for the mid- to high-single-digit growth guidance because there was quite a big FX move in Q1? I just
wanted to check that we've got the sort of starting point right for the guidance. I wonder if you could then maybe
comment following on perhaps somewhat on the last question, what the direction of the sort of RWA movements
if we look beyond 2020, whether you'd expect further sort of positive credit rating migration to come in 2021 or
whether you might actually start to see that reverse again. And also maybe comment on the timing of the $100
billion reduction that was part of the restructuring program, whether how far back has that now been pushed. And
then finally on RWAs just loan drawdowns, again, how much of that is translating into RWA as well. Thank you.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
So, if you use around $850 billion I think as a sort of base for the RWA inflation for the remainder of the year in
terms of ratings migration, I think if – yeah, as Noel just said in terms of the lag effect, you should expect I think
some continued ratings migration into the early part of next year assuming we're into a stronger recovery at that
point post the trough and Covid-19 impacts. Then, you're right, over time, you should see that ratings migration
begin to reverse over the remainder of 2021 into 2022.
The impact of drawdowns, I think we have provided some analysis of where in the earnings release on – where
you saw significant uplifts in RWAs, which principally were in Global Banking and Markets and Commercial
Banking. A decent part of that was in relation to drawdowns. On the drawdowns themselves, we did see
substantive levels of drawdowns in sort of mid-March towards the back end of March. That has eased off
substantially in April. And, in fact, in some cases, some of the money being drawn down has actually reversed out
now.
So, I think you should view that very much as a significant impact on Q1 that we won't see repeatable during the
remainder of the year at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Okay. And thank you for that. And only one part on the cost question, just the sort of the redundancy program, the
35,000, which obviously has been put on hold for now, I'm just wondering how much you've therefore had to
absorb in terms of cost reductions, which have been pushed further out to sort of in your 2020 guidance? And
then what's – how that sort of might phase in as we look further forward in terms of the benefit of those
redundancies coming out of the staff cost going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Tom, I'll take that. We thought it was the right thing to do for the benefit of our customers and our people to
actually pause that redundancy program at this point in time in 2020. We wanted our people to be 100% focused
on serving customers and not to be fearful of our redundancy program, hence the pause. The cost of that pause
in terms of loss savings in 2020 is in the order of a roundabout $380 million of foregone savings in 2020.
Now, as Ewen said earlier on, we believe we can mitigate that impact by cost savings elsewhere in the elements
of costs that are variable and under our own control that are not people related. And if you go back to our
February presentation, we guided that our total cost base for 2020 would be flat on 2019. Now, we're guiding that
our cost base for 2020 will be lower than 2019, but we can mitigate that loss of savings plus some by reduction in
other elements of the cost base such as hiring activities, travel and VP and other discretionary line items. The
issue for us will then be at what point do we reactivate that program in order to make sure that 2021 and 2022
cost base is appropriately positioned? But it's too early to make that call at this point in time.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And, Tom, just to give you some numbers around that, last year, we paid out $3.3 billion in variable pay.
Travel and entertainment was just over $400 million. Marketing was just over $1 billion. So there was about $4.7
billion of spend across those three line items. We accrued – spent about 35% less in the first quarter across those
three line items than we had in the previous year, yeah, which would get you to fairly meaningful cost reductions.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Yeah, when Noel was talking about the pause in the restructuring program and certain elements of that, I think
what that means is that, at the full year, we also talked about $6 billion of cost to achieve, of which about 40% of
that would be incurred in 2020. I think you should have seen that that number will come down, but it will be a
timing difference. So I think the right way to think about the program is we intend to do the program, but the front-
end of it will have sloped.
I'd make the same observation about the RWA rundown program. We still think that we can do the bulk of what
we expected to do this year. I think some of the sticky and more complex stuff may be harder to shift and it really
comes down to an economic case, whether we want to crystallize valuations at that level or we want to pause. But
again, I think realistically, we'll get the bulk of what we wanted to do – done this year, but with some pause, part of
that into next year.

Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Okay. And should I assume – you haven't flagged it specifically that the actual investment – sort of strategic
investment spend is not going to get chopped significantly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
We're targeting our strategic investment spend obviously much more cautiously today than we would have done
three, four months ago. But we're still spending on programs that we believe are strategically important for the
future, particularly in anything to do with digital. We've seen the evidence of that in the first quarter. We spent well
over the past two years on upgrading many of our digital platforms. I mentioned the treasury management
platform for corporates and the mobile version of that. We've seen a massive take-up in activity levels on that
platform. And I think we see the Covid-19 situation increasing the demand for digital support and therefore we will
continue to invest in it.

Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning. Good morning. I just wanted to ask to start with on your view on how severe this credit cycle
is going to get. And I mean just looking at some of the economic forecasts out there, it seems to indicate that the
base of economic contraction is worse than what we have experienced in prior credit cycles.
12


HSBC Holdings Plc

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
On the other hand, there is equally a number of government support schemes in place, which aimed at obviously
softening the impact. And I was just wondering if you could help us in that sense how you think about the credit
cycle?
And tied to that, just in terms of the $7 billion to $11 billion ECL guidance for this year, is it possible to point to
some form of real GDP assumption for this year, which this is tied to? I think one of the European peers tied their
guidance to a specific contraction number in GDP and I was just wondering if there's any more color you can give
us either for the $7 billion to $11 billion or for the severe case in terms of cumulative real GDP contraction?
And lastly, I was just wondering in terms of looking at your loan book geographically, if there is any elements
within geographies that you are most concerned about, it seems like Asia, particularly Hong Kong is holding up
[ph] better (00:41:19), already part of cycle has already started to recover there. Is it other parts of the book
outside of Asia you're most worried at this point? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, Martin, I'll take couple of comments first and then pass to Ewen specifically on the $7 billion to $11 billion. Our
job at the moment is to position the bank to manage a variety of different outcomes that could emerge from Covid-
19. None of us know for certain what the severity of the crisis will be. We're modeling different scenarios and
we're making sure as a bank we prepare for each of those scenarios that could emerge and that's why we're
confident we can handle this because of the strong capital, the strong liquidity that we have. But none of us know
for sure we're not – and I'm not a medical professional, I'm not an economist, so our job is to be prepared for all of
the scenarios.
With respect to the government support schemes, we've been particularly impressed with the pace and the
determination that the governments around the world in Hong Kong, in China or in the UK, in the US, have put in
place support schemes that are very, very material, but again, none of us know fully, we've not seen that level of
support come in and we haven't yet seen how that will change customer behavior. So, we're very positive on
them. We factor them into our scenarios to provide mitigation for some of the risks that we see, but only time will
tell as to how effective they are at supporting the economy, but they are very beneficial to have in place and we'll
see how they work over time. With respect to $7 billion to $11 billion, I'll hand over to Ewen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, I wouldn't – look the $7 billion to $11 billion, Martin, is part science, part art, the – I wouldn't try and say,
look, here is the GDP forecast, the GDP recovery profile and that gets you to X. I think that's too simplistic. We're
having to overlay, as Noel just talked about, fairly unprecedented levels of government support which we think will
significantly mitigate some of the more extreme scenarios you may have seen in terms of expected credit losses.
Also Covid-19 personally I think it's going to be quite disruptive to the profile of how some industries recover, how
the airline industry recovers will be different to another sector for example. But equally within a sector like the
airline sector, how governments respond and who gets recapped maybe very different too. So, it's not a
straightforward piece of math that we can give you to say, this gets you to the low end and that gets you to the
high end.
The thing I would probably pay most attention to is the recovery profile that we begin to see as we progress
through the second and third quarters of this year. We're already seeing the start of a decent recovery particularly
in Mainland China and to a lesser extent Hong Kong. We expect the second quarter to be tough in Western
13


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Europe, UK, US and other places and therefore, we are understanding the path of that recovery into the second
half of this year, I think. So therefore when we stand up at Q2 results, I think we know a lot more, we'll be able to
provide you with a lot more color at that point on what we're seeing.
In terms of the question on geography, I think if you look at the spread of ECLs in Q1, a couple of observations.
Yeah, we took $1 billion of the $3 billion in Asia. If you back out Hong Kong and Mainland China, there was about
$800 million across the region, a decent chunk of that related to one single name exposure we had that's been
commented on in the press in Singapore. So, Asia definitely outperformed. Yeah, but it was pretty broad based
across the rest of the world. On the retail side, we have some emerging signs of deterioration in the consumer
credit portfolios across a number of markets. On the wholesale side, it was pretty diverse and not just Covid but
also all price related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
And just a follow-up in terms of your comment, if we were to think about 2021, 2022 and the comments on the
recovery, should we then expect a comparatively sharp drop in risk costs again from today's perspective or would
this in any case take longer to level off from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Look, I mean if you are being conservative you would assume I think that there is going to continue to be elevated
credit costs in 2021, but the price cyclical impact of IFRS 9 should mean that 2020 is materially ahead of 2021.
And then you should begin to see, I would have thought a relatively sharp drop off as you get into 2022.

Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane SA (United Kingdom)
Morning, Noel, Ewen. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to come back firstly on capital and RWAs and
the commentary around comfortable going below 14% this year, if we take the RWA guidance and assume circa
5% growth for the rest of the year, that would knock up about 70 basis points I think. And if we assume cash
generation pre-RWA is comparable with the first quarter of 20 basis points, you end up back in the middle of the
14% to 15% range. So, I'm trying to understand if going below 14% is reflective of the dividend taking you there,
with Q4 perhaps being more than just the normal $0.21 final or if the 20 basis points underlying run rate cash
generation pre-RWA moves that we saw in Q1 could be lower for the rest of the year. So that was the first
question.
And now, I had a quick question on BoCom. In the earnings release, you referenced should the current
environment persists, that it might have implications for certain assets like your stake in BoCom, I don't think you
published the value that you've seen in Q1, but I'm not sure if you calculated internally and what you're seeing
there or whether we have to wait for H1 for an update? Thanks.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, just quickly on BoCom, no change in approach. The value in use continues to be higher than where we
hold the asset and we'll update more fully as part of Q2 results. I haven't got your math on capital, but I think we
can imagine scenarios as we progress through 2020 and 2021 that our Core Tier 1 ratio will fall below 14%. I
think as we progress through the price cyclicality impacts of IFRS 9 both in terms of ECLs and the impact on
RWA inflation because of ratings migration, I think we are comfortable operating the bank in sort of 13% to 14%
range if necessary over 2020 and 2021.
I don't think we're going to be under any regulatory pressure at that level. Our MDA, as you would have seen has
actually fallen because of the reduction in counter-cyclical buffers, for the MDA for the group now is at 10.9%. So,
we would be several hundred basis points above MDA at that level. And as I say actually the regulators at the
moment I think would be comfortable probably operating at levels below that because they're very keen for us to
continue to be able to support domestic lending both in Hong Kong and here in the UK. So it'd be very much I
think driven by our view as to what the appropriate level of capital is. And I also would not read into that any
implications about future dividend policy and where we may see it.

I just wanted to follow up really on the question around the dividend please. You said with the strategy update you
and the group would need a sustainable return on tangible equity of 11% to 12% in order to keep the dividend
sustainable, but you've outlined for us today pressure on NII of an extra $2 billion and rising potentially further
pressures on ECL. So my question is what goes into the mix in terms of working out the future dividend payout?
Would you constrain RWA growth in the future in order to sustain the dividend or have you got further cost cuts
which can help drive the – back up to the 11% to 12% return?

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So I mean, what you've repeated back to me in terms of what I said, is what I said. So the – I think we're going to
need to sit down later in the year and really understand where we are in sort of post-Covid-19 environment, where
the long-term trajectory on interest rates are, where long-term trajectory on business growth is, does that
environment have implications for parts of the strategy that we set out in February?
And when you throw all of that together in the mix, where do you get to a combination of sustainable returns and
sustainable growth? Out of that, you can then say what is the sustainable distribution policy, but it's sort of too
early to sit here today and give you guidance on that. Realistically, I think we won't be having that discussion well
into the second half of the year and we're obviously committed to give you an update ahead of full year results in
2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
But there isn't an extra $2 billion or $3 billion of costs that you can easily strip out of the business presumably to
make up the NII deficit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, look, I mean, that would be part of the mix too that we're going to have to consider and as I had talked
about earlier, I went through three line items that got to $4.7 billion of cost that we think we can materially reduce.
But obviously, flexing down the cost structure and ability to flex down the cost structure. And as Noel referred to
earlier, we're already beginning to see the emergence of a meaningful shift in some markets towards greater use
of digital channels than what we would have seen and the acceleration probably in parts of our business plan
towards digital, that we couldn't have imagined a few months ago. So again, that's part of the mix of things that
we're going to have to think about post understanding of where Covid-19 takes us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Okay. I just have one very quick follow-up on the credit cost which people had asked about, I'm just trying to
juxtapose your $7 billion to $11 billion with the much higher charge you take in the UK stress test, you're over £55
billion over five years. A lot of that is in years...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
...one and two. Is the delta between your severe scenario and the bank being in the stress test, the government
support which you mentioned, or is it the pace of recovery in that you're assuming things get better quite quickly
next year, which of those two is dominant in producing a lower ECL?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
Well, I think there're sort of three things. I think the extent of government support I think has a material mitigating
impact relative to what you saw in the ACS results. I think again, the pace of recovery and the shape of that
recovery I think looks very different to what you saw in the ACS. And the first thing I'd point to is just parts of Asia
are already in recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So the – I do think when we've done that comparison for ourselves, we're comfortable for the time being the $7
billion to $11 billion range we've sat down and thought about how that sits alongside an ACS scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
ACS was much more penal on our Asian franchise than the current scenarios we model in for Covid-19.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Yes. Morning, everybody. Sorry. Just a very quick points of clarification. So just to be clear, in terms of your $7
billion to $11 billion impairment guidance, it's too simplistic to say that relates to the GDP range that you've given.
It's not a straight like $11 billion is at the top-end and $7 billion is at the bottom in line with those sort of GDP
ranges. Is that too simplistic a sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. One.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Okay. And secondly, the ratings migration that you've highlighted in the terms of risk-weighted assets, I think you
said that, that does incorporate something for government schemes or sort of regulatory comments about trying to
mitigate the extent of that? Can you give us some – have you got any idea of roughly how much, what it would
have been without that? Because it seems to be a huge number even on its own and I'm just trying to get a sense
as to what the sort of sensitivity around that might be?

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. I mean, look, we provide you I think in the full year results disclosure on the credit profile of our loan book and
you could run proxy estimates across that of what the impact of one or greater notch downgrade would be. I think
we see the impact of the government support is that we'll limit the degree of downward notching of the corporate
book that we would otherwise expect.
But you can run approximate maths in some of the disclosures that we've already got out there to come up with
your own views on that. But, yeah, that mid to single digit – mid-to-high single-digit growth in RWAs is consistent
with a fairly significant credit deterioration across the book over the remainder of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And I think what you're seeing is a change in the relationship – in the modeled relationship between a credit
migration on the balance sheet and the ECLs that may emerge in the P&L account and that the government
schemes are mitigating some of the emergence of the ECL, but you're still going to get the credit migration, you're
still going to get a movement in your balance sheet, but that movement will not straight line or model in the usual
way into a P&L impact. And that's why I think you may get a breakage in the normal relationship.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
And yeah. No, it does make sense. And I'm just – sort of in the context of your strategy, which is taking out $100
billion is I assume that this year, there's very little of that included, is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. I would disassociate what we've just – that from – yeah, we do, we have a program, a fairly mapped-out
program, to reduce RWAs by $100 billion over the next three years. Where we can execute parts of that program
in this environment, we will execute it and we do think the bulk of what we thought we could do this year, we will
end up doing by the end of the year, but not all of it.

Morning, Noel and Ewen. Just a couple of questions for me then. Coming back to the $100 billion, obviously there
was $100 billion [ph] gross part of your (00:58:47) reduction that we talked about, but there was also the $100
billion of growth in initiatives that obviously you're trying to do over your three-year plan. And I was just wondering
how the changed environment sort of impacts your thinking around where you wanted to position the business in
terms of growth and where you actually are seeing capital consumption going up? So, just some thoughts on how
that $100 billion of reinvestment would look like. Are you just parking that to the side for the moment?
18


HSBC Holdings Plc

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2020
And then, the second one, maybe a bit more specific on ECLs, I have had a look at the page 18 disclosures,
which are really helpful. So, thank you for that. But the questions I have still remaining are around the oil price, for
example, how are you factoring in oil price risk within your scenarios? And also, we've seen a significant increase
in fraud losses, obviously you mentioned the one in Singapore. But there has also been one in Middle East. And I
was just wondering what risk management lessons are you drawing from that and have you looked at the rest of
your book for potential losses within that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Let me take the RWA growth comment. I mean, you could argue we've just done $40 billion of RWA growth
in the first quarter out of the $100 billion, because it didn't come in the way that was originally intended through
new-to-bank and new-new business. But we saw an expansion in the balance sheet as customers drew down on
credit lines.
Now, will we see that repeated in Q2, Q3, Q4? No, Ewen is rightly to guide to that. That level of balance sheet
expansion is unlikely to repeat in future quarters. But we've already put $40 billion of earning assets on the book
in three months. We'll see how that moves over time.
In terms of the $100 billion program, I gave a statement in my opening comments that we're still committed to
capital efficiency, the capital efficiency program we launched in February. We have to adjust in light of Covid-19,
but the long-term goal of taking capital from underperforming businesses and reinvesting in performing
businesses is still our intent and I'm pleased to say that RWA growth in the first quarter is happening with good
clients, long-term strategic clients and in good areas of the business.
With respect to fraud, and then I'll hand off to Ewen on how oil has been factored into the scenarios, clearly, at a
time of stress, the emergence of fraud becomes more prevalent. So, a time of economic stress normally identifies
fraudulent situations that are taking place. And therefore, we are alert to that risk. We are doing a number of the
deep dives by sector on our portfolios that would be more susceptible to that. And that's part and parcel of normal
credit management and we're taking learning from any situations that emerge to try and read across to other parts
of the portfolio and adjust it quarterly, so we're taking those proactive steps.
I'd hand off to Ewen on oil price scenarios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. We – I mean, we've included a slide on what our oil and gas prices are at the back end of the appendix is
$25.7 billion of exposure at the end of Q1. Yeah. The higher end of the $7 billion to $11 billion range clearly
includes specific sector or stresses in some places including the oil and gas sector. So we have thought about it,
we have tried to build an appropriate stresses until that range.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank
It's Aman from Barclays. Hope you guys are staying safe. Just a couple of questions then, please. So just
following your disclosure on the at-risk sector stuff. Thanks very much for that. Can you give us a sense of any
existing provisions that you've got against those books in terms of what kind of coverage you have, after what
you've spoken today in particular would be useful. I'm just kind of thinking about what the kind of residual risk from
those exposures from here. So, any color you can give there would be really good.
And then, another on government guaranteed lending. I was just really interested in whether – when you kind of
look forward, do you envisage that being a material driver of the group balance sheet kind of going forward? I
know take up until now has been fairly slow, but obviously, you're seeing an acceleration in the terms of that
scheme at least 100% guarantee.
I guess as part of that as well, it'd be interesting also if you could – can you give us some indication of the kind of
commercial terms of lending under that scheme as well? So what's the fee that you have to pay to the UK
government for the guarantee, let's say 80% and versus the now 100% on the smallest lending?
And I mean particularly on that last tranche of lending, is there any reason why that's not potentially a fairly
profitable form of lending? I saw that the PRA basically confirmed yesterday that you should benefit from credit
risk mitigation benefits on expected credit loss and risk density. So the provision charge and the capital of that
lending continues, potentially implies that's pretty profitable lending. Is there anything I kind of misunderstood
there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. On the new scheme, we're still working through the details of that, that we'll launch next week. As you say
it's 100% guarantee. The fees and the pricing structure is still under debate. So I can't give any details on that at
this stage. We support the program. We think it's a good initiative, and we're doing it because we think it's right for
the customers not because we view this as a profit opportunity. We think it will be the right thing to do. And in the
grand scheme of things on our balance sheet, the size of our balance sheet, it's not something that I would guide
you from an investor point of view that it would be material in the grand scheme of our balance sheet, but it is
material to the customers that are taking, drawing down those funds and it's important to the UK economy, but it
wouldn't change your modeling in any way with respect to the materiality of that scheme or the other governments
scheme that are being launched. And in terms of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
