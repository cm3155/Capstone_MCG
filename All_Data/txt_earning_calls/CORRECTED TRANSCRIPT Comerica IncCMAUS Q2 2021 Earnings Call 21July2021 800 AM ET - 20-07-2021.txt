Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Our second quarter results showed continuation of
several favorable trends including strong deposit growth, robust fee income and excellent credit quality. Revenue
increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite the low rate environment. We remain focused on
expense control while supporting our revenue generating activities.
Also, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares, reducing our share count by over 4%. We generated earnings of
$2.32 per share and an ROE of over 17%, and an ROA of 1.5% remain above our historic norm. We continue to
demonstrate our unwavering dedication to providing a high level of service and support for our customers,
communities and each other.
During the quarter, we committed $5 billion in to small business lending over a three-year period. Also, we
appointed a national Asian-American business development manager who joined our Hispanic and African-
American development managers to support and strengthen relationships in our communities. In conjunction with
this announcement, we made a deposit into an Asian-American minority depository institution.
In regard to sustainability, our ESG Council recently defined the most significant ESG issues for our company,
specifically those that are most impactful for our customers and colleagues and in which we feel we can make a

meaningful difference. We call this our ESG commitment as outlined on the slide. I look forward to sharing with
you our continued progress in these critically important areas.
Turning to our second quarter financial performance on slide 4, we saw a solid loan growth in several business
lines led by general Middle Market. This was more than offset by a large decline in auto dealer floor plan due to
supply constraints as well as Mortgage Banker due to lower refi volumes. Our pipeline again increased as
companies ramped up with the economy reopening.
Deposit growth continued to be very strong. Average balances increased 6% or over $4 billion to another all-time
high. The full quarter benefit of federal stimulus payments along with seasonality contributed to a $1.7 billion
increase in consumer deposits. Commercial deposit growth mostly reflects our customers' solid profitability and
capital markets activity.
Net interest income increased $22 million. You may recall the first quarter was impacted by $17 million in lease
residual adjustments. We continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing as well as the securities portfolio
in this ultra-low rate environment.
Credit improved from already strong levels. We had net recoveries of $11 million, the highest level of net
recoveries in at least 20 years. Criticized and non-accrual loans declined, a true reflection of our disciplined credit
culture, diverse portfolio, and expertise in the industry's reserve. Our credit reserve continued to decrease and
resulted in a negative provision of $135 million as the portfolio continues to perform better than expected going
into the pandemic. The reserve ratio remains healthy at 1.44% excluding PPP loans.
Fee-generating activity was again robust. Noninterest income grew 5% with increases in card, commercial
lending, and fiduciary income. Also, expenses were well-controlled and our efficiency ratio improved. As I
previously mentioned, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares during the second quarter. We expect to continue
to make strides towards our 10% CET1 target, keeping a close eye on loan growth trends and capital generation.
Using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority, while providing an attractive
return to our shareholders.
Our customers and colleagues across our markets remain optimistic about the future. We expect economic
metrics to remain strong in the back half of the year despite labor and supply chain constraints. We believe that
these issues will fade with sustained economic momentum.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

James J. Herzog
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, average loans decrease $761 million. As Curt
mentioned, the biggest driver was an $870 million decrease in National Dealer Services as auto inventory levels
are very low due to supply chain challenges. Looking back two years, floor plan loans were down over $3 billion.
We believe that we are close to the bottom and over the next few months, inventory should start to slowly rebuild
and return to normal levels sometime next year.
Mortgage Banker declined approximately $300 million, coming off of the record levels reached at the end of last
year. Seasonally higher purchase volume was more than offset by lower refi volume, which is expected to
continue. Of note, our purchase-related volume was 67% in the quarter compared to the industry at 44%. On the

other hand, activity in several other businesses has begun to pick up, including general Middle Market,
Environmental Services, Commercial Real Estate, Entertainment, Equity Fund Services and Corporate Banking.
As far as PPP, average loans decreased a little over $100 million during the quarter. However, on a period-end
basis, PPP loans declined nearly $1 billion as the forgiveness process accelerated at the end of the quarter.
Excluding the decline in PPP loans, period-end loans were up $613 million due to increases in general Middle
Market, Environmental Services, and Commercial Real Estate, partly offset by a decrease in Dealer.
Total line commitments increased $1.5 billion with growth in most business lines led by general Middle Market.
Usage also grew resulting in line utilization holding steady at 47%. Our pipeline increased despite the strong level
of commitments closed during the quarter and the portion in the last stage of the pipeline again grew significantly.
This bodes well for future loan growth.
Loan yields increased 16 basis points including the 14 basis points impact from the lease residual adjustment in
the first quarter and 2 basis points from fees including accelerated fees on PPP loan forgiveness. All other factors
offset each other.
Average deposits increased $4.1 billion, climbing to a new record as shown on slide 6. Noninterest bearing
deposits accounted for almost 75% of the growth. The full quarter benefit of recent fiscal stimulus along with
strong cash generation drove the increase. With strong deposit growth our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to
66%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 6 basis points, a decrease of 2
basis points from the first quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 7 basis points.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. During the quarter, we purchased approximately $2 billion of
MBS to replace about $1 billion in MBS repayments and $750 million in treasury maturities, as well as continue to
deploy some of our excess liquidity. The net result was about a $250 million increase in the portfolio at period end
and a slightly higher proportion of MBS.
By increasing the size of the MBS portfolio by over $1.5 billion since year-end, we have been able to mitigate the
rate headwind and maintain approximately the same level of securities income. MBS purchases in the second
quarter had average durations of six to seven years and yields of about 185 basis points. This compared to
securities rolling off at 230 to 250 basis points, which resulted in a decline in the portfolio yield of 1.82%. Our goal
is to continue offsetting the pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing
the portfolio size.
Turning to slide 8. Net interest income increased $22 million including the $17 million in lease residual
adjustments recorded in the first quarter. The net interest margin was stable as the impact from the lease residual
adjustments was offset by the large increase in excess liquidity.
As far as the details, interest income on loans increased $18 million and added 8 basis points to the net interest
margin. This was primarily due to the lease residual adjustments. One additional day in the quarter added $4
million, and fees, primarily PPP-related, added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin. Lower loan balances
had a $3 million impact, and lower LIBOR and nonaccrual interest recovery each had a $1 million impact. The
benefit from a modestly larger securities portfolio was mostly offset by the lower securities yields.
Average balances to the Fed increased over $3 billion, which added $1 billion and had an 8 basis point negative
impact in the margin. Fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at nearly $16 billion and weigh heavily in the

margin, with the gross impact of approximately 50 basis points. Continued prudent management of deposit pricing
added $2 million and 1 basis point to the margin.
Product quality was very strong, as shown on slide 9. Net recoveries of $11 million were comprised of a decrease
in gross charge-offs to only $8 million combined with a relatively high level of recoveries of $19 million.
Nonperforming assets decreased slightly and remained low at 64 basis points of loans. Also, criticized loans
declined in nearly every business line and are now close to pre-pandemic levels.
Strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence in sustainable economic growth, resulted in a
decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of note, the social distancing-related segments continue to perform
better than we expected. Also, with help from an increase in oil prices, the energy portfolio had significant
decreases in nonaccrual and criticized loans as well as net recoveries of $12 million. However, we continue to
apply a more severe economic forecast to both of these areas. Our total reserve ratio is very healthy at 1.36% or
1.44% including PPP loans.
Noninterest income increased $14 million or 5%, as outlined on slide 10, continuing the positive trend we've seen
over the last five quarters. Card fees increased $13 million and are 23% higher than a year ago, primarily due to
government card, and to a lesser extent, also merchant, consumer, and commercial card activity. These have all
been spurred by economic stimulus, changes in customer behavior as well as new and expanded customer
relationships.
Commercial lending fees increased $9 million to the highest level we've seen in over five years, primarily driven
by an increase in syndication fees. Fiduciary income set a record with a $7 million increase, mainly due to annual
tax service fees, a full quarter benefit of the trust advisory business we acquired in March as well as equity market
performance. Deferred comp asset returns were $6 million, a $3 million increase over the first quarter, and are
offsetting noninterest expenses.
Partly offsetting these increases, derivative income decreased $8 million as there is a $1 million benefit from a
change in the credit valuation adjustment compared to the $10 million benefit in the first quarter. Aside from this
change, underlying derivative activity remains robust. Following strong performance in the first quarter, warrant
income decreased $4 million and BOLI declined $2 million. In summary, we are pleased with another strong
quarter for fee income.
As shown on slide 11, expenses were up $16 million in the quarter. The primary drivers were a $7 million increase
in outside processing in line with higher revenue and elevated litigation costs related to pending resolution of
certain legal matters. Also, we had a seasonal increase in advertising and higher operational losses, which
returned to a more normal level. Salaries and benefits decreased $5 million, mainly due to annual stock
compensation and payroll taxes resetting in the first quarter. Providing a partial offset was an increase in
performance-based incentives, annual merit, tech-related labor as well as deferred comp. We continue to
demonstrate that we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. With our CET1 sitting well above our target, we entered into an
accelerated share repurchase program for $400 million at the end of April. We also repurchased an additional $50
million of shares in June. Our CET1 ratio decreased to an estimated 10.39%, and our goal is to continue to make
strides towards our CET1 target of 10%, while carefully watching loan growth trends and capital generation. In
addition, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield, which is currently yielding about 4%.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second
quarter. Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in most businesses, led by Middle Market as a result of
increasing working capital and CapEx needs. This is supported by our robust pipeline and expectations that the
economy will continue to grow. Of note, we believe Mortgage Banker will decline modestly due to lower refi
volumes and seasonality. In addition, we believe National Dealer is close to a bottom as auto inventory levels are
expected to start to rebound as we get closer to year-end.
As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we expect loan forgiveness will continue to pick up and the
bulk should be repaid by year-end. We expect average deposits to remain strong. Customers continue to maintain
excess balances. However, at some point, we believe they will start to put the cash to work. We expect net
interest income to benefit from loan growth, excluding PPP, and additional days. However, we believe this will be
more than offset by the anticipated decrease in PPP loans.
Credit quality is expected to remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we believe the
allowance should continue to move towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect customer-driven fee categories to
continue to benefit from strong economic conditions along with our focus on attracting and enhancing customer
relationships. However, card fees are expected to decrease as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate
volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity as [indiscernible] (00:17:16) stimulus
payments wane.
In addition, in the second quarter, there were categories that were also somewhat elevated such as fiduciary due
to the second quarter tax preparation fees and deferred comp, which is difficult to predict. On a year-over-year
basis, we expect to see solid growth in the second half.
We expect expenses to decrease. Certain line items should be seasonally higher such as occupancy, advertising,
and travel and entertainment.
In addition, as we continue to invest for the future, technology investments are expected to rise modestly as they
typically do in the second half of the year. However, more than offsetting these factors, we expect second quarter
levels of litigation-related expense and deferred comp will not repeat.
Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to continue share repurchases.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are seeing many favorable trends including some
loan growth momentum in certain business lines including general middle market. With strong ISM services and
manufacturing indices and a record number of job openings, business and consumer confidence remains positive
in the support of a continued growth in the back half of the year.
As we continue to navigate this ultra-low interest rate environment, we are focused on delivering a more
diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation. And our progress is demonstrated in
a consistent increase in noninterest income over the past five quarters. We are investing for the future to ensure
we can provide high-caliber products such as our treasury management services.

In the second quarter, Comerica became one of the first banks to offer commercial banking customers the ability
to send real-time payments. In addition, business deposit capture now includes the ability to scan images of
checks for deposit with a mobile device. Finally, utilizing intelligent automation, we improved our integrated
receivables offering.
Our expertise and experience continues to help us build and solidify long-term relationships particularly in
extraordinary times like these. We are uniquely positioned with our nimble asset size, large customer deposit
funding base and commercial bank weighting complemented by robust retail and wealth management
capabilities. Finally, we are committed to maintaining our conservative credit culture, strong capital base and
expense discipline. These key strengths provide the foundation for creating long-term shareholder value.
Thank you for your time. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Gary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted just to ask about the loan outlook for the back half of the
year. I know you're talking about generally more positive and close to bottom on dealer floor plan. About the
energy segment in particular, it's like E&P balances kind of stabilized this quarter after a decline last quarter. How
are you thinking about that segment now given the increase in commodity prices?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Gary, it's Peter, and appreciate the question. Yeah. We are still an energy bank. And over the years, you've seen
our portfolio. We've migrated away from the services business still in midstream, still in E&P. We are seeing
opportunities, but we're being very selective about what we do. The underwriting is probably more conservative
than it was in years past.
I don't know that I would tell you what commodity prices have done lately has necessarily made us dive into it
more. We've seen improvement in the credit portfolio, which is really good. And so, I think we're going to continue
to have opportunities there. I do feel like the headwind we've seen over the last few years of balances dropping is
slowing. So, encouraged – we're encouraged by that and feel like it's a space we're going to continue to be able
to be able to successful at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up, if I could, on kind of expectations for liquidity deployment back
half of the year. Obviously, that influx of deposits continues quite a bit and the net increase in the securities

portfolio was fairly modest for the quarter. So even with your commentary about expectations that customers
started to use those deposits at some point, it seems like you've got plenty of excess liquidity that you could put to
work and I'm just thinking about how you're viewing that going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Gary. It's Jim. Thanks for the question. First, starting with second quarter, you're right and it may
have looked on the surface like a modest increase in our securities portfolio. So, there is a lot of wood to chop in
the second quarter. We did have $750 million of what I'll call lumpy treasury maturities up and beyond the almost
$1.1 billion of MBS. So, we feel we were very busy on the securities front even in the second quarter going after
good quality securities just to get the average up to $250 million or the purchases up. So, we feel like we have
some good momentum in the second quarter.
Our plan for the second half of the year is, of course, to replace the MBS maturities as we always do. We do have
$400 million of treasury maturities in the third quarter and another dose in the fourth quarter, and we outlined
these on slide 18 in the appendix. And so, we plan on replacing not only the MBS maturities but also those lumpy
treasury maturities. And then we plan on also to find some modest additional amount above that to offset the rate
pressures in the securities portfolio.
But having said that, we certainly have a lot of excess liquidity to deploy and we are deploying some of it as we
did in the second quarter. At the same time, if you look at what the market is doing right now, we're not sure if we
want to rush in to that and dramatically increase the size of the portfolio, given all the maturities and given the
MBS we're putting on to replace them. So, we will continue to make steady progress in deploying the excess
liquidity, making sure that we're going forward on the overall securities balance as well as offsetting any rate
pressures. But I wouldn't look for the excess liquidity to take a massive dive in the next quarter or two. We want to
be very measured about how we increase the securities portfolio.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just starting off, in terms of fee income,
obviously, a very strong quarter, but it does seem that from your guidance that some of that is sort of unusual in
nature. I think you mentioned like the tax prep and fiduciary and something in card as well. Can you just quantify
how much was, let's just say, unusual in this quarter that needs to reverse going into 3Q or the back half?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Yeah, Ken. It's Jim. Yeah. I'll be happy to answer that. We have been very strong in non-interest income, not just
in this quarter, but if you look at the slides on page 10, the numbers and the trend, we have gradually been
increasing every quarter for the last five quarters. And I'll remind everyone that our run rate for non-interest
income prior to the pandemic was about $1 billion a year, which we hit in the third quarter of 2020 as we came
back in the recovery of the pandemic. Since then, we continue to elevate. And you see some of the unusual items
for the current quarter over on the right side of the slide.
I don't think we're going to slide back to the old $1 billion a year that we used to ran at, but we are not going to
stay at these current levels either. That would be a very dramatic increase in a short period of time. So, part of
these will certainly take a step back from where we're at today. Now, I don't think they will go back to pre-
pandemic levels because we've had a change in customer behavior. There's a lot more electronic use of cards
and other channels beyond some of the cash usage we used to see. And so, card fees will probably end up
somewhere in between where they started during the pandemic and where they're at now.
Commercial lending fees, obviously, are high this quarter, one of the highest quarters we've ever seen. Fiduciary
income, we will maintain half of that increase you see in this quarter. We'd have added customers and we did
make a small acquisition for a trust advisory business. So, you will see a portion of that continue. Deferred comp
of $3 million, that's the increase, but the absolute number of deferred comp was $6 million, and we always
assume that's zero each quarter.
And so, you do some extraordinary levels of non-interest income currently occurring. We will take a small step
back, but we will not return to the old pre-pandemic levels either. So, overall, we think going forward, we're going
to show some nice percentage growth on our year-on-year non-interest income if you go back to the base year of
2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. All right. That is very helpful. I guess just in terms of the second question, you've mentioned that
dealer could be close to a bottom. I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit more about that. I know you
mentioned the rebalance as you get the new inventory coming in in the fall, but can you just layer in the supply
chain issues and if that's still an issue and if that's still affecting your dealers and how that might affect growth in
the back half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Ken, it's Peter. I think the answer to your question is it is still affecting – the supply chain is still affecting things.
You've obviously seen some plant closures in Michigan. But in talking to our customers, we're encouraged that
we're getting to the bottom. I don't know that I can tell you exactly when that's to be or when the uptick, what
month that would occur in. But we do feel like the headwind, again, is going to get slower going into the back half
of the year. We're encouraged at what we think would occur particularly in Q4 going into next year.
I do think though we're talking 2022 before we really start to see some improvement in floor plan balances. And I
think it's probably even a little further out. I've been asked in the past about getting back to the numbers that you
see on slide 23, for example, in prior years. I think that's probably at least 1.5 years or 2 years out.
But we do feel like we're reaching the "bottom", if you will, of where the supply chain constraint is for the dealer
business. And again, our dealers continue to perform really, really well. We are adding customers. We feel like we
bank the best of the best in the space. We had great deposit growth in dealer. So it's a business that we really,

Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Kind of a follow up on that. Can you touch a little bit more on the general middle
market growth and how you think things may have changed relative to quarter ago? It feels like we're seeing a
Commercial Bank recovery in front of our eyes here, but just curious what your thoughts are on it. Then, also, can
you touch on – you mentioned the pipeline of loans in the last stages. Can you talk a little bit about that as well?

that our pipeline is above pre-pandemic levels and I would say candidly, well above pre-pandemic levels of what
we're seeing of late. And when we mentioned the later stages, it feels very good about what we feel like the
closings are going to look like in the next 90 days to 180 days. So, when we talk about that, we're pretty positive
that those are going to lead to new commitments and outstandings. We had a great commitment quarter in Q2
increases, and so we're encouraged that that would occur when we tell you guys that the later stages of our
pipeline are feeling very, very good.
As far as middle market, I would tell you and I think, Jon, to affirm what you said, it does feel across the board
really, really encouraging. And in just about all of our geographies, many of our verticals, we are seeing the
pipeline growth. We're seeing activity pick up. Michigan had a fantastic quarter followed by Texas and then kind of
California, and I think that's just a little bit indicative of the size of the books in those markets and the number of
customers and opportunities. But as things start to open up across the country, I think you're going to see it unfold
pretty quickly and we are seeing it in that middle market space. Again, we had a very good Q2. Historically, Q3
has been a challenged quarter for us in middle market but we are encouraged this time just based on what we're
kind of seeing as of the recent quarter end.

And then maybe one for Jim just on the net interest income guidance. It feels like things are positive and maybe
the margin is bottoming here, but this phrase more than offset by the decrease in PPP loans. How material is that,
and really, what needs to happen for your net interest income guide to potentially flatten out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good. Thanks, Jon. Happy to take that question. I'll try to boil this down to really the big drivers. Our net interest
income is really going to be driven by loan volume over the coming quarters. If you look at deposit pay rates,
securities for which we're going to try to offset any rate pressures with volume, our purchase funds, they're all
going to be likely very stable from an income standpoint going forward.
So that takes you right back to loans as the big driver. So let's talk about loan and their impact in the net interest
income line item. As Peter was saying, ex-PPP, we do think we're going to get some good loan growth in the
second half of the year in our core businesses. And so, you can do the math on that, and that will be a nice pick
up to the net interest income. However, the major headwind will be the PPP volume and the paydowns that occur
there. That will certainly more than overpower any core growth we get on the other end.
And just to throw off the numbers here, as we disclosed in the package, I think on page 19, our quarterly average
in the second quarter for PPP was $3.5 billion. And as we disclosed, the ending balance at the end of the quarter,
it was $2.8 billion. So when you look at the third quarter average and what we're headed for relative to what we're
seeing, we're probably going to end up with the third quarter average that's probably half. It could be a little bit
less than half of what we saw in the second quarter. So that's approaching a $2 billion drop in PPP balances.
Keep in mind those are earning about 2%. So that's a pretty significant headwind.
And then as we move to the fourth quarter, you'll probably see that PPP balance go in half yet again. Now, putting
aside the normal yield which includes amortized fees, we think our accelerated fees in the third quarter will likely
be around the same $15 million that we saw in the second quarter, but it's probably going to be about half of that
in the fourth quarter. And so, when you look at those factors just from PPP more than overshadowing what's
going on in the core portfolio, that will create a headwind.
Now, just some smaller items to consider, we do some smaller headwinds from swap maturities that we itemized
on page 18. That includes the second quarter maturity in June that will have a small impact on Q3. And then I'll
just say, LIBOR, [indiscernible] (00:34:13) loan mix, competitive pressures, all of those things can move it up or
down slightly. We'll see where those go. But again, I'll just summarize it as it's really going to be a function of loan
volume for the most part and to what extent we can offset the PPP average rundown. So, hopefully that helps.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Good morning. I guess just the first question on slide 18. Jim, if you could talk about from an ALCO standpoint,
you talked about the duration of the new securities that you bought. How are you thinking about and no one
knows when we get to a rate hike from the Fed. But talk to us as we approach a Fed rate hike cycle, how you're
thinking about maintaining asset sensitivity, and how we should think about the duration of the securities book
leading into that.

James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
When we look at our decisioning around securities portfolio on how we grow it and the type of securities we add
to it, there are a lot of considerations. But we think we're in a very advantageous position to take advantage of
what good rates might be out there for certain types of securities.
When I look at Comerica or asset sensitivity, it's high and it actually has grown since the end of the year since we
added all these securities. It's mostly a function of deposit growth, but there are some other factors also. And so,
we feel like with all the asset sensitivity we have, certainly adding securities, fixed rate securities is something we
can afford to do and we can afford to spend some of that asset sensitivity. We did add securities with longer
duration over the last couple of quarters. But again, if you look at our average duration, it's pretty reasonable, and
we think it's pretty manageable especially when you consider the rest of the complexion of our balance sheet and
some of our long-term deposits. We consider the fact that we have excess liquidity. That's certainly not an issue.
We can probably afford to do more.
And then just when you look at the sweet spot out there in terms of what's available, swaps really aren't a good
value right now; treasuries, not a good value. We think given the capacity we have to add some longer duration
securities to the balance sheet and the yield that offers, it's really the right way to go for us, and we feel like we
can continue to go this direction. Having said that, no one knows where rates are going. There's no free lunch out

there. There could be regret in either direction. But we think, given the complexion of our balance sheet and our
business model, this duration is something that we can afford to add to the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, I might add that as we see rising rates occur, which would be a good thing, obviously, for the banking
industry, some combination of leveraging our securities portfolio and synthetic hedges would really be our focus
at that point. And we made good progress on hedging before the pandemic and then, obviously, rate scaled so
dramatically that we really were not able to fully hedge the portfolio. But we're always going to be an asset-
sensitive bank. But in a rising rate environment, we'd like to meet some of that asset sensitivity. And then
secondly, I would say just our focus on fee income continues to be a way that we're trying to diversify the overall
asset sensitivity of the revenue base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. That's helpful. And just on a separate – based on your response to one of the earlier questions, it doesn't
sound like you're seeing a big divergence geographically in terms of loan demand, Midwest versus California
versus Texas. Give us a sense of – there's been a lot of headlines around this move from California to Texas. Are
you actually seeing that in any discernible way when you look at client movement and just demand from your
customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Ebrahim, yeah, it's Peter. So, yeah, but I do feel like our growth that we've seen has been across the country to
answer that question. And then second, we feel like with our geographic footprint, we're in a great spot to support
customers moving from California to Texas or Texas to Michigan or either way. I mean, I think you're seeing
anything else that we're seeing on population movement. We continue to feel really good about the California
economy and the opportunities that are there. And so, I think the answer to your question is, yes, we are able to
support our customers through that but both markets are really opportunities for us to continue to grow our
customer base and our portfolio and we're seeing that occur. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, I might just add that – maybe just add a comment on California because we do get that question
periodically. And as Peter said, we're still very bullish on that market. I mean, it's still the sixth largest economy in
the world. It's still a very diverse economy. We're seeing some positive trends in import, export activity, travel and
leisure. There are a number of things where a positive to point to, despite some of the challenges that have been
very public for the California market.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just a question on – back to the loan growth front. On line utilization, I know you indicated that it
remained steady at around 47%. I guess based upon the activity that you're seeing and then you're encouraged
by, is it fair to assume that you do expect an increase there in drawdowns? And can you also help us frame out
what's your longer term utilization level that you think is fair to assume and the timing that you believe you can get
back to that level? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
John, it's Peter. I think we're seeing utilization, as we mentioned, level out. I think that we'll probably see it – I
hope we'll see it bounce along there to slightly up as we go forward. I don't know that you're going to see a
tremendous increase in utilization. I mean, obviously, the big question in the industry is when does this liquidity
deposits get used up first versus borrowings occurring second and when is all of that going to occur? I think that
as you get into the back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of utilization increase. But I think customers are going
to do a little of both is what I've said. I think they're going to maintain higher cash balances. I think they'll start to
use a little more credit. I don't think they're going to swing heavily one way or another just because – despite the
encouraging outlook across the country, all of our customers are more cautious about the future than they have
been, as we all are.
So, I think the timing of those two things occurring are going to be interesting to unfold but we're encouraged by
the utilization we saw in Q2. We think that it's going to hang in there, start to increase a little bit, and I think it'll
probably be in the next year or maybe even further before we get back to "normal" utilization levels that you might
have seen in years past or pre-pandemic.

nudge down their internal target. Can you just talk about that potential if there is any likelihood of being able to
move that target lower over time? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Great, John. It's Jim. Happy to take that question. For now, we are comfortable with that 10% target. We're
always observing the environment and just taking note of what's going on both on the regulatory front and just the
overall economy. But right now, we are comfortable with the 10%. We're always in tune with some of our key
constituents such as regulators and rating agencies to make sure that we're properly positioning our capital.
Having said that, we will continue to observe what's going on and certainly one of our internal goals is rates go up,
to take pretty significant steps to smooth out our earnings stream with respect to asset sensitivity. We know that
we have a very good credit risk profile. We would like to improve our earnings stability profile from an asset
sensitivity standpoint. And I can tell you that once we do that, I will feel better about potentially considering – and I
think our board would too, considering going below 10%. That may accompany a little bit of a shift in the capital
stack. We may issue some preferred to that time. But for now, I will say we are comfortable to 10% target.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask on the reserve and so what you guys
consider the steady state once we complete the reserve drawdowns? Is the plan to level it out at the pre-
pandemic CECL day one reserve? Or just given the improving macroeconomic backdrop, is there an opportunity
to take it down below that level in you guys' eyes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Scott, this is Melinda. Thanks for the question. Obviously, first and foremost, CECL is really a complex
accounting exercise that we go through every single quarter based on what the economic forecast is at that time
as well as how our portfolio is performing. As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect, based on the
performance – the strong performance of the credit portfolio and what we believe to be the economic forecast at
this time, that we're going to continue to see reserve levels moderating down to a pre-pandemic level for day one
CECL. Day one CECL was about 123. We're at about 144 right now, so it's reasonable to assume that we'll
continue to trend downward over the course of the next couple of quarters. Given the fact that CECL is new, I
don't know that anybody really knows where the "bottom" of CECL is, but I do think it's possible that we could see
reserve levels fall slightly below that day one CECL number.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. That's excellent color. Thank you. And then, wanted to revisit the floor plan business for just a

how dealers have adapted to inventory world or adapted to a low inventory world, do any of your customers sort
of tell you that there is some middle ground where there is like a net benefit to having lower inventory levels than
they've carried in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Scott, it's Peter. Yeah. I think the dealers would tell you that they're having as much profitability as they've ever
had, and these lower inventory levels for them actually work pretty well for the dealership. The question really is
about the industry in general and what do the OEMs do at the end of the day. And our belief is that when we get
to the other side of this it would be back to normal. And 100% back to normal? I don't know. I think that's probably
debatable amongst – in the industry.
As you see on slide 23, I mean, you're right, our balances have been in the $6 billion to $7 billion range for a long,
long time. And in particular, floor plan has been $3 billion higher than what it's running today. We think we'll get
back to that. I don't know if we'll get all the way back to it, but we definitely think in the coming years that we'll get
pretty close to it. And again, I think that comes back to when does normalization hit the space, and we believe,
based on the conversations that we're having, that, that will happen, it's just a question of timing. And so, that's
why we feel that way.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to start, so if we look at the $671 million of general middle
market loan growth that you saw in the quarter, did you see those companies draw down their deposit balances
prior to drawing on credit lines or are they drawing on lines concurrent with deposit balances being highly
elevated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Steven, it's Peter. I'd say it's a little more of the latter that you said. I think that they are borrowing in conjunction
with still having the deposit balances. So, I believe middle market loans in general still grew. So, back to what I
was kind of saying a little bit earlier, I think that some of this is a timing issue. I think you've got an optimistic,
encouraged economic environment but cautious leadership of middle market companies that want to make sure

that they've got liquidity for whatever comes. So, they're comfortable borrowing some more money but they still
want to have cash in the bank. And, candidly, that's why our credit quality looks so good. So, I think that as we sit
today, I would answer you that it feels like they're borrowing more money but still maintaining cash balances. And
back to – I would tell you, utilization, a little bit back to this question, even though it was flat for the company, it
was up a little bit in middle market.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. And then – thank you. [ph] Well, you are (00:48:44) seeing new loan opportunities, right, every
bank is in the same boat, you guys are with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, is the competitive environment – I imagine
it's significantly more intense, is it primarily rate or are you starting to see structure enter in terms of companies
trying to win away from you, guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steven, I continue to feel like it's primarily rate. I think the banks for the most part continue to be really,
really responsible on credit structures so the most competitive piece of it right now does seem to be rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I could squeeze one more and just final. On the Environmental Services
business, it actually saw a nice growth this quarter, right, that's been flat for most of the past year. Is this a
onetime bump or should we be expecting this to be a more significant contributor to loan growth each quarter?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
I know I'm expecting it to be a more significant contributor to loan growth, Steven, so we think this is a great
business for us. We feel like we are a leader in this. We've talked about dealer mortgage, energy, there are TLS,
there's a number of businesses that we stand out in. ESG is another one where we are really encouraged by the
opportunities we're seeing. We're adding talent to this space. We're exploring lots of different avenues that we can
do in ESG, including renewables, solar opportunities. So, we're encouraged that's why we have a slide in here
this quarter, and so we believe it's an opportunity for us to continue to grow this business.

Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow up on the capital return question. You used a good, good 70
basis points of CET1 with the combination of the risk-weighted asset inflation and the big buyback. I'm just
wondering as you go forward and expect better loan growth which would imply continued if not faster RWA
growth, how does the buyback [ph] fit (00:50:52) against that in terms of the magnitude? It would seem that you
could get to your 10% pretty close without even doing much buybacks. So, just wondering – the balancing act
between the two. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Ken. Good morning. It's Jim. Yeah. You're exactly right. We expect earnings to continue to be strong. The
dividend, of course, is already strong. But we are expecting – as we saw it into the second quarter, we are
expecting continued good core loan growth. And so, that will make us far less reliant on share repurchases in the
third and fourth quarter. And I would certainly expect our share repurchase dollar amount to be far less than what
we saw pace-wise in the second quarter. So, yeah, that will be a – we will be winding down probably the absolute
amounts of that tool as loan growth services step in and it can become essentially a very productive use of our
capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just on, you made a point earlier about balancing out your asset sensitivity and I'm just
wondering if you can elaborate on that a little bit more vis-à-vis, like, does it make you think about changing the
orientation of the swaps book, adding, terminating, just kind of – we have that great layout on 18, but just any –
page 18, but just any updated thoughts on how you would anticipate doing that as we get closer to the rate cycle?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, we are very asset-sensitive currently even with all the securities we've added. So – and we are always
going to be asset- sensitive to some extent, but we do want to reduce that asset sensitivity gradually and probably
pick up the pace of reducing it as rates go up over time. And so right now, we do have excess liquidity. We do
have the room on the balance sheet. The best value right now, we feel, is adding securities.
But I think what you'll see is as rates go up, you'll see us start to transition from on-balance sheet tools to more
synthetic tools and adding off-balance sheet hedges. And off-balance sheet hedges will become probably the
primary way we do it once we start seeing rates go up. But for right now, we think we do have a room in the
balance sheet to use cash instruments, and you'll just see us gradually transition as rates go up over time. And
we will ultimately reduce a very large amount of the asset sensitivity, but now is not the time to do that. But at the
same time, we're not going to sit and do nothing either right now. So it'll be measured over time, that's how I
would describe it.

next year. You could see the overall swap number actually decrease. We may be able to offset that with cash
instruments, but for now we just don't see the value, with swap rates being where they're at right now. But
certainly it will be our primary tool over time as rates start to go up.

Good morning, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. It sounds from your earlier comments that there is an appetite among your dealer
partners for keeping floor plan levels lower versus history even after the supply chain issues have been resolved.
From Comerica's perspective, what are your thoughts on the idea that lower floor plan balances wouldn't
necessarily be a negative since dealer floor plan loans are 100% risk weighted and they're relatively low yielding
such that you may actually find that it's actually accretive to your ROEs if we did see dealers [ph] like lower
(00:54:32) inventory levels in the future? Can you speak to that thought process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Bill, it's Peter. I don't know if Jim wants to add in here, but our approach is to make sure we're supporting our
customers. I mean, that's the number one focus for us. So, I – your question you're asking is a really big picture
one on what does the business look like going forward. We're going to support them whether they've got low
inventory levels. And right now they've got huge deposits, we're supporting them with wealth management
opportunities, finding other ways to take care of our customers in this environment. The day will probably come
that they will need the floor plan availability, because it may candidly be something that gets pushed on them. It
may not be something that they can necessarily decline. And so, we'll be there to support them through that. And
we've been in this business over 50 years, and it's been good for the bank the whole time. We continue to believe
it will be going forward and are very encouraged about what that could look like into the future.

James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, I might add that that's a business where we also have other opportunities. You mentioned wealth
management, but we do a lot of real estate lending for new ad points for dealers. And then there's a fair amount of
M&A activity that we support on the lending side as well. So, there are other ways that we support the dealerships
beyond just the floor plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's super helpful. If I may just follow up on the point that it may get pushed on them and it may not just be their
decision. So, if the dealer does want to run with less inventory and customers remain willing to, as I think we've
seen during the pandemic, either take whatever inventory is on hand or wait a few months if they want something
more specific, that willingness is there. I guess, what are some of the other variables that would lead to sort of
that being pushed on them? Just maybe if you could give a little color on [ph] what you're looking at (00:56:31).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Well, yeah. It's just the manufacturing of cars. I mean, the industry historically has been – cars are manufactured
and they're sold at the point that it arrives on the dealership. So, in the past, that's the sort of model that you have.
I don't know that we're moving to a completely just-in-time type environment. Maybe we are. I'm not attempting to
try to predict what that does or doesn't look like. But one way or another, our job is to support our customers. And
whatever unfolds there, we're going to be there to do it.
Don't forget, we're a huge auto lender in Michigan as well so we're very comfortable with the auto industry space,
whether that's on the car manufacturing side, the dealer side. Whatever happens with autonomous driving,
whatever happens with electric vehicles, we feel like we're a bank that's able to be a leader in the auto space as it
unfolds in the next couple of decades and there's going to be a lot of macro things that happen but we are well
positioned to be in the front of that.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Hey, great. Good morning. Great. I want to follow up on Ken's interest rates and some of the questions, asked a
little bit differently. We've seen some of your peers talk about taking down rate sensitivity as rates go down – rates
go up. And some of them are doing it through purchasing of resi mortgages to add duration and they're saying
that's a better risk adjusted yield than just buying MBS. I'm wondering if that's at all on the table as you kind of
consider broader ALCO strategies. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Chris, and welcome to the coverage. Being a commercial bank, we're actually quite
comfortable with our current approach of buying the MBS securities, they carry far less capital that you have to
hold on them. We feel we have the expertise to manage it. And so that's where we choose to put that liquidity is
on the mortgage-backed security side. And then from a pure business standpoint, we're comfortable with our
current business mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then, as a follow up, just interested – and maybe I missed it in your prepared remarks, normalized
cash levels, obviously, they're pretty high right now, and I guess, to the degree and timing you expect to hit
normalized. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Chris, that will be a function of what happens in the economy. Right now, we have incredible fiscal stimulus. We
have very accommodative monetary policy and that is driving a large amount of excess liquidity. The Fed will start
tapering at some point but taper doesn't mean stop, it just means taper. And in the meanwhile, I just see this fiscal
stimulus continuing to occur. The economy is running at a very high rate right now and will for some time, and that
creates a bit of a velocity factor or multiplier which creates deposits in the system. And I do see these deposits,
they'll move around the banking system but I don't see them leaving it to any large extent.
And so, I do see deposits waning a little bit for Comerica. We do some businesses that are specific to some of the
stimulus that's occurred and some of those businesses will lose some of the deposits over time, but I think we're
going to be very flush with deposits for some time to come. We will see loan growth start to eat into that, but I
don't see us getting back in the foreseeable future to the more minimal levels of cash that we were holding prior to
the pandemic. So, it just feels like this environment is here to stay for some time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Just on commitments here, you guys mentioned another really strong increase for the quarter
here. I think it was up about 5% in the first quarter. Just kind of curious as to how strong it was. And also just, are
these from existing customers or new customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, it's Peter. Yeah. So, the commitments were up on slide 5 $1.5 billion in the quarter which was a really,
really good quarter compared to the last five. It's a little mix of both. We've got – we typically run on average
historically, about half and half, half new to new, half new to existing. And I'd say right now, it's a little more new to
existing, but it was a little bit of both. And again, a very, very quarter for commitment increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of just loan pricing, maybe go drilling down a little further on that. Just kind
of curious as to where loan spreads are now versus maybe prior quarters – the last couple of quarters or pre-
pandemic levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, I'm kind of reluctant to say anything about where loan spreads are. I would just tell you that, again,
pricing is more aggressive than it has been historically. It's definitely the more challenged part on winning
business versus credit exposure. So, I think you can infer from that, that loan spreads in general are lower than
they historically have been. But we don't usually comment about what sort of spreads we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jennifer, I think each of us has a perspective around the table here. It's somewhat of a recent phenomenon. But
in general, I think it's fair to say that it has gotten more competitive and more challenging. [ph] The side (01:02:38)
has really gone through a transformation here, it feels like, and there are a lot of people, not just at Comerica, but
friends, family, people are making life changes and life choices about how they move forward from the pandemic
and that's created a little bit of churn. Beyond that, you just have – what we see is a whole bit of wage inflation
that might be coming not just our way but in the whole industry, and you're seeing this across the whole economy.
And for us it's anecdotal. A lot of that is not in the run rate at this point in time. But just as we stay in touch with the
market, it does feel like there's a bit of a challenge there just as other manufacturers and service industries we're
seeing in terms of getting the talent in for the same price that we used to. So, it does feel like we're going through
a little bit of a transition as an economy and that's something we're going to have to adjust to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, if I might just add, this is Curt, that we feel like we did a really good job of being sensitive to our employees'
needs throughout the pandemic, and being accommodative and supportive financially and otherwise of our
employee base. And we, as a company, sort of pride ourselves on having a longer tenured employees and deep
relationships with not only customers but employees over time. And certainly there is some pressure out there
and we're trying to stay in front of it in terms of the right benefits, in terms of retention where it's needed and just
in terms of being proactive, and communicating and connecting with our employees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
What has the post-pandemic work environment looked like for your employees? I mean, how many are going to
be – will be back in the office full time versus flexible versus totally remote?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jennifer, we are about – this is Curt again, we are about halfway, maybe more than halfway through our return to
office planning. We – our execution will have – be completing that in sort of the August-September timeframe
unless something significantly changes. We all are dealing with this sort of this COVID resurgence and variants,
etcetera. But assuming that is manageable, that is our plan right now.
And what we are focused on or what we've been saying is that the majority of our employees will be in the office
the majority of the time. But that does not mean that everyone will be here five days a week. We will certainly
have employees who are here five days a week, but we will have employees where we're providing more
flexibility, really depending upon the job and the employees' needs as well, so we'll have some that are working
three days in the office, two days at home or four days in the office, one day at home. Those types of things. We
will have very few employees that are working completely remotely. And I think that's important just from the
standpoint of maintaining our culture, our environment, apprenticeship, development of employees, the
collaboration amongst our employees, etcetera.
